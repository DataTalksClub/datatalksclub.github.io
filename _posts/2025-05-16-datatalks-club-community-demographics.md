Previously, we published 4 articles on the results of a big survey about the usage of AI tools, data engineering tools, MLOps tools and LLMs-related tools by our community members:

Check them out if you still haven't!

What we also asked them to share is their background information to better understand who makes up the DataTalks.Club audience.

In this article, we present aggregated insights on respondents' geography, seniority, roles, organization size, and industry, completing the picture of our global data community.

## Geographic Distribution

Our survey attracted voices from more than 65 countries, but five of them stand out:

- India (10.3%)
- Germany (8.6%)
- United States (8.3%)
- Nigeria (5.5%)
- France (4.8%)

Beyond this top five, contributors span everywhere from Canada and Spain to smaller contingents in Paraguay, Yemen, and Uzbekistan. We have a truly global data community!

## Career Level / Seniority

Our respondents skew heavily toward hands-on professionals:

- **Senior-level** practitioners represent **41.2%** of the sample
- **Entry-level** newcomers make up **35.8%**
- **Mid-management** roles (Lead/Head) account for **10.1%**
- **Executives** (Director & C-suite) only **3.4%**
- **Freelancers, students, and other backgrounds** combined total **6.4%**

This distribution suggests DataTalks.Club is a community rich in experience but yet still welcoming to early-career talent! Leadership voices remain a smaller, specialized segment.

          data-labels='["Senior Level", "Entry Level", "Lead / Head", "Director & Executive", "Freelancer / Student / Other"]'
          data-values='[41.2, 35.8, 10.1, 3.4, 6.4]'

          data-width="600px">

Most respondents occupy senior or entry-level roles, with a smaller fraction in leadership/executive positions. Freelancers and students together account for under 7%, indicating that this survey skews toward industry professionals over learners.

## Job Role

Data engineering emerges as the single largest discipline, but analytics and Machine Learning (ML) remain well represented:

- **Data Engineers**: **26.2%** (over a quarter of respondents)
- **Data/Product Analysts**: **11.8%** and **Data Scientists**: **13.8%** together form a robust analytics cohort
- **Machine Learning Engineers**: **11.1%** and **Software Developers**: **11.1%** round out the top five
- A diverse tail of **Consultants**: **4.0%**, **Business Analysts**: **3.4%**, **Researchers**: **2.3%**, **DevOps/Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) specialists**: **1.3%**, and other niche roles provides additional depth.

This diversity reflects the reality where raw data pipelines, statistical modeling, and production-grade machine learning systems all intersect and that most of the knowledge we provide in our courses and events is useful for a wide range of roles.

          data-labels='["Data Engineer", "Data Scientist", "Machine Learning Engineer", "Data / Product Analyst", "Developer / Software Engineer", "Consultant", "Business Analyst", "Researcher", "DevOps / SRE / Platform Engineer"]'
          data-values='[26.2, 13.8, 11.1, 11.8, 11.1, 4.0, 3.4, 2.3, 1.3]'

Data engineering leads in representation, closely followed by core analytics and ML roles. A broad array of specialist titles (e.g., BI Analyst, MLOps Engineer, CAE Engineer) appears at low frequency.

## Organization Size

The employment of our community spans the full range of organization from solo practitioners to global enterprises:

- Large enterprises (1,000+ employees): 30.1%
- Mid-sized firms (51–500 employees): 34.8%
- Small teams (1–50 employees): 20.6%
- Freelancers and solo operators: 15.2%

Such a bimodal split highlights both the scale at which data initiatives operate in established organizations and the agility of boutique or freelance setups.

          data-values='[30.1, 15.2, 12.5, 12.5, 9.8, 8.1, 8.1]'

</figure>

Nearly one-third work in large enterprises (1,000+), while small teams and freelancers together comprise over one-quarter of respondents—highlighting a mix of large-scale and boutique operations across the industry.

## Industry / Sector

While technology and software companies lead the pack with **41.0%** representation, our survey also captures other fields:

- Technology/Software: 41.0%
- Finance/Banking: 9.5%
- Education/Research: 9.2%
- Healthcare: 8.1%
- Retail/E-commerce: 7.5%
- Remaining contributions come from Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Public Sector, and other specialized verticals.

This mix confirms that data and AI capabilities are vital across industries, not just in technology companies.
