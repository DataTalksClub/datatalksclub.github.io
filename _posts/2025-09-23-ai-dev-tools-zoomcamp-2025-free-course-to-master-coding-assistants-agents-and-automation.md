AI development tools have moved into everyday engineering work. Chat applications like ChatGPT and Claude, coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, project bootstrappers like Bolt and Lovable, agents, and automation platforms like n8n have shifted the way we code and automate our workflows. The ecosystem is broad, and it's not always clear which tools to adopt or how to use them reliably in real projects.

AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp is a free, project-based course that helps you build a practical toolkit for this stack. Over six modules, you'll explore vibe coding and the AI tool landscape, ship a simple end-to-end project with React and FastAPI, extend assistants with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), build your own Django coding agent, apply AI to testing and DevOps, and automate workflows with n8n.

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience applying AI to everyday engineering tasks, plus a small portfolio and a certificate that shows how you work with modern AI dev tools.

## Who the Course Is For

AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp is designed for people who want to work confidently with today's AI development stack. It's a good fit if you want to understand how coding assistants, agents, project generators, and automation tools actually fit into real engineering work.

This course is great for:

* **Software developers** who want to apply AI tools to everyday tasks like coding, debugging, testing, and project setup.
* **Engineers** looking to integrate assistants, agents, or workflow automation into their existing stack.
* **Learners who prefer building** rather than reading documentation, and who want guided, project-based practice with modern AI tooling.

You don't need any previous experience with AI tools. A basic ability to program (Python, JavaScript, or similar) is enough to follow the materials and complete the projects.

* Document your AI-powered development journey

## How AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp Works

### GitHub Repository

All lessons, homework, and cohort updates live in the [AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp). The structure mirrors our other Zoomcamps, so you can quickly find weekly folders, homework forms, and project guidelines.

<figcaption>AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp <a href="https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp">course materials on GitHub</a></figcaption>
</figure>

### Homework Assignments

Each module includes homework to practice what you've learned and track your progress. You can also compete on the course leaderboard, which adds a fun, competitive element.

### Learning in Public

A unique feature of our Zoomcamps is our **"learning in public"** approach, inspired by [Shawn Wang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkBCPqWKCL8&list=PL7NIGf5_PlM-Dk3lgPsZFT94Ng7PpRQEh&index=5&t=195s){:target="_blank"}'s (@swyx) [article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public){:target="_blank"} on the topic. Instead of keeping your progress private, you're encouraged to share assignments, reflections, and projects online.

<figure>

<figcaption>Extract from Shawn @swyx Wang's article explaining the benefits of learning in public</figcaption>
</figure>

Explaining what you've learned helps you understand it better, builds confidence, and creates visible proof of your skills. To encourage this, we award bonus points on the leaderboard for public posts about your work.

This practice has led to real opportunities for learners. For example, [**Pastor Soto**](https://datatalks.club/podcast/s21e03-from-medicine-to-machine-learning-how-public-learning-turned-into-career.html){:target="_blank"}, who joined ML Zoomcamp without a LinkedIn account, began posting his projects publicly. These posts not only accelerated his learning but also attracted attention from recruiters at Meta and DeepLearning.AI. Similarly, [**Daniel Egbo**](https://youtu.be/b92gwrsVQtg?si=ziRFIcrYN3GQiVhV){:target="_blank"} shared his progress on LinkedIn, which opened the door to collaborations on projects such as deploying models with Intel's OpenVINO toolkit.

### Certificate

<figcaption>An example of the certificate for the <a href="https://datatalks.club/blog/data-engineering-zoomcamp.html">Data Engineering Zoomcamp</a>, another free course at DataTalks.Club</figcaption>
</figure>

To earn your free certificate, you need to complete a final project and review at least 3 other students' projects. This ensures you demonstrate practical application of the concepts.

Many learners have turned these connections into collaborations and long-term professional relationships.

## How to Join AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp

You can join AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp either by **following a live cohort** or **learning at your own pace**.

All materials are freely available in the [AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp). Each module has its own folder, and cohort-specific homework and deadlines are in the `cohorts` directory. Lectures are pre-recorded and available in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hLuyafXPyhTdbF4s_uNhc43), so you can follow the live cadence or binge-watch at your own pace.

### Option 1: Self-Paced Learning

You can start anytime and move at your own speed. You get full access to materials and community support on Slack.


You can complete homework assignments on the [course platform](https://courses.datatalks.club) and build a project for your portfolio, even outside a live cohort.

> With self-paced learning, homework isn't scored, your project isn't peer-reviewed, and you can't earn a certificate.

### Option 2: Live Cohort

AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp runs once per year and typically starts in November.

When you join a live cohort, you get:
- Updated homework
- Automatic homework scoring and a leaderboard
- Project peer review
- Eligibility for a certificate after meeting all requirements

> Even if you join after the official start date, you can still follow along. Note that some homework forms may already be closed. All active deadlines are listed on the [course platform](https://courses.datatalks.club).
