## Introduction

When you’re choosing how to learn ML, one straightforward path is online courses. In this list, we’ve collected a curated set of free (or free-to-audit) ML courses you can choose from. These range from university lectures to structured programs offered by online platforms, giving you a variety of entry points depending on your background. Certificates are often optional and paid, but the learning materials themselves are accessible to anyone.

Our goal here is to save you time: instead of trial and error across countless options, you’ll find in one place the most solid foundations to start building your ML skills.

## Note about Free Courses

Some options are fully free and even provide certificates, but those are rare.

Most major platforms, such as Coursera and edX, allow you to audit course materials (videos, readings, lecture notes) at no cost. However, if you want access to graded assignments or a certificate, you’ll need to pay. On Coursera, keep in mind that the Audit option is only visible on individual course pages—not on Specialization pages.

University open-courseware is another category: these are completely free and often come with full access to lectures, notes, and problem sets. The trade-off is that they usually don’t offer certificates of completion.
