</figure>

We introduce the core ideas behind Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You'll set up your development environment, learn how retrieval works, and start experimenting with APIs and search tools. By the end of this module, you'll have a basic RAG setup and be familiar with text search fundamentals.

You will learn to:

-   Set up your environment for LLM and RAG experimentation
-   Understand the basics of retrieval and search
-   Use the OpenAI API to integrate LLM capabilities
-   Build a simple RAG system
-   Implement basic text search with Elasticsearch

### Module 2: Open-source LLMs

We dive into the world of open-source LLMs, providing hands-on experience with popular, freely available models. You'll learn how to configure a GPU environment, access models from the Hugging Face Hub, and even run LLMs on CPUs when GPUs aren't available. This module ends with creating a simple UI to see your model in action.

You will learn to:

- Set up and optimize a GPU environment
- Access and use open-source models from Hugging Face
- Run models on a CPU using Ollama when GPUs aren't available

You will learn to:

- Ingest data seamlessly
- Set up a smooth data pipeline for LLM projects
- Prepare data for scalable and efficient processing in RAG systems

### Module 6: Best Practices

We dive into advanced techniques for refining your RAG pipeline, from improving retrieval quality to enhancing search relevance. You'll practice hybrid search methods, document reranking, and explore using LangChain for more complex applications.

You will learn to:
- Apply best practices to optimize your RAG pipeline
- Use hybrid search techniques to increase retrieval accuracy
- Implement document reranking to enhance search results
- Set up a hybrid search with LangChain for advanced retrieval tasks

### Learning in Public

A unique feature is our "learning in public" approach, inspired by [Shawn @swyx Wang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkBCPqWKCL8&list=PL7NIGf5_PlM-Dk3lgPsZFT94Ng7PpRQEh&index=5&t=195s){:target="_blank"}'s [article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public){:target="_blank"}. We believe everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their expertise level.

<figcaption>An extract from the Shawn @swyx Wang's article about learning in public</figcaption>
</figure>

Throughout the course, we actively encourage and incentivize learning in public. By sharing your progress, insights, and projects online, you earn additional points for your homework and projects.

Sharing your work online also helps you get noticed by social media algorithms, reaching a broader audience and creating opportunities to connect with individuals and organizations you may not have encountered otherwise.

### Course Projects for Your Portfolio

If you've ever participated in an interview or conducted online research, you likely understand the significance of personal projects. To receive a certificate, you'll need to finalize and submit an [end-to-end RAG application](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/blob/main/project.md){:target="_blank"}. It allows you to choose a problem that interests you, find a suitable dataset, and develop your model.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>Can I still join if I just discovered the course?</summary>

Yes, but if you want to receive a certificate, you need to submit your project while we're still accepting submissions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need a confirmation email after registration?</summary>

You don't need a confirmation email. You are automatically accepted into the course. You can even start learning and submitting homework (while the form is open) without registering, as submissions are not checked against any registered list. Registration is primarily used to gauge interest before the start date.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I join the "Office Hours" or live sessions?</summary>

Office hours are conducted via YouTube Live where students can participate by submitting questions through Slido (a link will be pinned in the chat). The video URL for each session is posted in the announcements channel on both Telegram and Slack before it begins. You can also find the live stream on the DataTalks.Club YouTube Channel. Please note that questions should be submitted through Slido rather than the chat, as chat messages may be missed due to high activity.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I get a certificate in self-paced mode?</summary>

No, certificates are only available when completing the course with a live cohort. Self-paced mode does not include homework submissions, project evaluations, or certificates. This is because the certification process requires you to peer-review three capstone projects, and these peer reviews only happen during the active course period. Additionally, the submission form closes after the peer-review list is compiled. Self-paced learners can access all course materials and the Slack community, but must join a live cohort to earn a certificate.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I still get a certificate if I missed the first homework?</summary>

Yes! The only requirement for receiving a certificate is passing the Capstone project. Homework assignments are not mandatory, though they are recommended for reinforcing concepts and understanding the material better. Your homework points will count towards your position on the course leaderboard, but they don't affect certificate eligibility.
</details>
