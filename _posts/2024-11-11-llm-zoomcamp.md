Teams turn to large language models (LLMs) because they want applications that can answer questions or search information more intelligently. But once they start building, they discover how unstable these systems can be: answers change from one run to the next, search quality depends heavily on how data is indexed, and a small prompt adjustment can break a feature that worked yesterday. Without a clear way to retrieve the right context, measure output quality, or monitor how the system behaves in the real world, it's difficult to trust the results.

LLM Zoomcamp is designed to close this gap. This free course covers the fundamentals of LLMs and RAG, how vector and hybrid search work in practice, how to evaluate retrieval and model responses, and how to monitor user behavior once a system is live. The focus is on practical, grounded methods that make LLM-powered applications more predictable, stable, and easier to maintain.

## Why Learning to Build LLM Applications Is Important

Large language models are rapidly expanding across industries, yet transforming experimental prototypes into reliable, production-ready systems remains a significant challenge.

According to Red Hat's [research](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/enterprise-ai-survey-ambition-value-gap-and-importance-open-source), AI has become a core strategic priority for 72% of organizations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, with plans to increase AI investments by an average of 32% by 2026. However, only 7% of organizations currently report "driving customer value" at scale from their AI investments.

This gap between ambitious AI strategies and real outcomes is why expertise in building, evaluating, and maintaining LLM-powered applications is increasingly sought after in today's market.

## Who the Course Is For

LLM Zoomcamp is designed for anyone who wants to build practical, reliable LLM-powered applications. If you can write Python, use the command line, and work with Docker, you have everything you need to follow the course.

It's a good fit for:

* **Software engineers** who want to add LLMs, RAG, and modern search capabilities to real products.
* **Data engineers** interested in how vector search, hybrid search, and retrieval pipelines fit into production systems.
* **ML practitioners** who want a structured way to evaluate and monitor LLM-based applications.
* **Developers new to LLMs** who already know Python and want a clear, practical introduction to building end-to-end AI applications.
* **Technical product managers or tech leads** who need a working understanding of how LLM systems behave in real usage.
* **Anyone maintaining an existing LLM feature** and struggling with drift, inconsistent answers, or unreliable retrieval.

You don't need prior experience with AI or ML. The course focuses on the engineering side of modern LLM applications and guides you through the concepts step by step.

## Course Curriculum

The course follows a practical, production-focused approach to building LLM applications. Each module adds a new layer—from RAG foundations to vector search, evaluation, monitoring, and a complete end-to-end project.

### What You'll Build: Course Project

For the final project, you'll create a complete end-to-end RAG application. The goal is to show that you can move from raw data to a working, searchable AI system that users can interact with, and that you can evaluate and monitor.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2024-11-11-llm-zoomcamp/llm-zoomcamp-fitness-assistant-project.png" alt="LLM Zoomcamp Fitness Assistant project - conversational AI RAG application helping users choose exercises and find alternatives for personalized fitness guidance" title="LLM Zoomcamp Fitness Assistant Project Example" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption><p>Example project: Fitness Assistant - a conversational AI that helps users choose exercises and find alternatives, making fitness more accessible for beginners who find gyms intimidating or lack access to personal trainers</p></figcaption>
</figure>

You'll build:

1. A searchable knowledge base: Choose a dataset and ingest it, clean it, and store it in a format suitable for retrieval.
2. A retrieval pipeline that works in practice: Implement the core RAG flow—retrieve relevant context from your knowledge base, assemble prompts, send them to an LLM, and return grounded answers.
3. An evaluation process: Measure how well your system retrieves and answers information. This can include search metrics, LLM-as-a-judge, or your own evaluation framework.
4. A user-facing interface: Build a simple UI or API so others can try your application. This can be Streamlit, FastAPI, a small web page, or anything that makes interaction straightforward.
5. Monitoring and feedback loops: Once your app works, you'll add a basic monitoring layer—tracking queries, feedback, or performance so you can see how it behaves over time.

By the end, you'll have a working RAG system that demonstrates your ability to design, build, evaluate, and deploy an LLM-powered application.

## How LLM Zoomcamp Works

### Learning in Public

A unique feature is our "learning in public" approach, inspired by [Shawn @swyx Wang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkBCPqWKCL8&list=PL7NIGf5_PlM-Dk3lgPsZFT94Ng7PpRQEh&index=5&t=195s){:target="_blank"}'s [article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public){:target="_blank"}. We believe everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their expertise level.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2024-11-11-llm-zoomcamp/learning-in-public-concept-shawn-wang.png" alt="Learning in public concept by Shawn Wang - benefits of sharing your learning journey and building a portfolio through public documentation" title="Learning in Public Concept by Shawn Wang" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption><p>Extract from <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">Shawn @swyx Wang's article</a> explaining the benefits of learning in public</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Throughout the course, we actively encourage and incentivize learning in public. By sharing your progress, insights, and projects online, you earn additional points for your homework and projects.

Sharing your work online also helps you get noticed by social media algorithms, reaching a broader audience and creating opportunities to connect with individuals and organizations you may not have encountered otherwise.

### How to Get a Certificate

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2024-11-11-llm-zoomcamp/llm-zoomcamp-certificate.png" alt="LLM Zoomcamp certificate - free certificate for completing the LLM Zoomcamp course" title="LLM Zoomcamp Certificate" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption><p>LLM Zoomcamp certificate for completing the course</p></figcaption>
</figure>

To receive a certificate, you'll need to complete the [final project](#what-youll-build-course-project) and peer review 3 other students' projects:

1. **Complete the final project**: Build a real-world LLM application (RAG project) that demonstrates your mastery of all course concepts
2. **Peer review**: Evaluate and provide feedback on 3 fellow students' projects during the peer review process
3. **Submit on time**: Meet the project submission deadlines to qualify for certification

## How to Join LLM Zoomcamp

You can join LLM Zoomcamp either by **following a live cohort** or **learning at your own pace**.

All materials are freely available in the [LLM Zoomcamp GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp). Each module has its own folder, and cohort-specific homework and deadlines are in the `cohorts` directory. Lectures are pre-recorded and available in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hIB4fSqLy_0AfTjVLpgjV3R).

### Option 1: Self-Paced Learning

You can start anytime and move at your own speed. You get full access to materials and community support on Slack.

You can complete homework assignments on the [course platform](https://courses.datatalks.club) and build a project for your portfolio, even outside a live cohort.

> Under self-paced learning, homework isn't scored, your project isn't peer-reviewed, and you can't earn a certificate.

### Option 2: Live Cohort

LLM Zoomcamp runs once per year and typically starts in June.

When you join a live cohort, you get:
- Updated homework
- Automatic homework scoring and a leaderboard
- Project peer review
- Eligibility for a certificate after meeting all requirements

> Even if you join after the official start date, you can still follow along. Note that some homework forms may already be closed. All active deadlines are listed on the [course platform](https://courses.datatalks.club).
