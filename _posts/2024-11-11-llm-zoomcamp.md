</figure>

We introduce the core ideas behind Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You’ll set up your development environment, learn how retrieval works, and start experimenting with APIs and search tools. By the end of this module, you’ll have a basic RAG setup and be familiar with text search fundamentals.

You will learn to:

-   Set up your environment for LLM and RAG experimentation
-   Understand the basics of retrieval and search
-   Use the OpenAI API to integrate LLM capabilities
-   Build a simple RAG system
-   Implement basic text search with Elasticsearch



### Module 2: Open-source LLMs

We dive into the world of open-source LLMs, providing hands-on experience with popular, freely available models. You’ll learn how to configure a GPU environment, access models from the Hugging Face Hub, and even run LLMs on CPUs when GPUs aren’t available. This module ends with creating a simple UI to see your model in action.

You will learn to:

-   Set up and optimize a GPU environment
-   Access and use open-source models from Hugging Face
-   Run models on a CPU using Ollama when GPUs aren’t available

This module teaches you how to efficiently manage data ingestion for LLMs.

You will learn to:

-   Ingest data seamlessly
-   Set up a smooth data pipeline for LLM projects
-   Prepare data for scalable and efficient processing in RAG systems



### Module 6: Best Practices

We dive into advanced techniques for refining your RAG pipeline, from improving retrieval quality to enhancing search relevance. You’ll practice hybrid search methods, document reranking, and explore using LangChain for more complex applications.

You will learn to:

-   Apply best practices to optimize your RAG pipeline
-   Use hybrid search techniques to increase retrieval accuracy
-   Implement document reranking to enhance search results
-   Set up a hybrid search with LangChain for advanced retrieval tasks



### Module 7: End-to-End Project

</figure>

You’ll bring everything together in a practical project. You’ll apply all the skills you’ve learned to complete an end-to-end project, from data preprocessing to deploying your solution.

You will learn to:

-   Build an end-to-end project using RAG techniques
-   Practice preprocessing text data for specific use cases
-   Apply learned techniques in a real-world project

The [course description](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp){:target="_blank"} on GitHub provides a detailed overview of the topics covered each module. To dive into the content, you can see the video lectures, slides, code, and community notes for each course module.

### Theory and practice

We make LLMs theory accessible and engaging through real-world examples. We also demonstrate code directly in the lectures to show the implementation of concepts. This way, you can easily apply them in your projects.

For instance, in one of the lectures about a linear algebra refresher, the lecturer switches between screens. Firstly, they explain the concept of the dot product of two vectors, and then they demonstrate its implementation using Python.

### Learning in public approach

A unique feature is our "learning in public" approach, inspired by [Shawn @swyx Wang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkBCPqWKCL8&list=PL7NIGf5_PlM-Dk3lgPsZFT94Ng7PpRQEh&index=5&t=195s){:target="_blank"}'s [article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public){:target="_blank"}. We believe everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their expertise level.

</figure>

Throughout the course, we actively encourage and incentivize learning in public. By sharing your progress, insights, and projects online, you earn additional points for your homework and projects.

Sharing your work online also helps you get noticed by social media algorithms, reaching a broader audience and creating opportunities to connect with individuals and organizations you may not have encountered otherwise.

### Course projects for your portfolio

If you've ever participated in an interview or conducted online research, you likely understand the significance of personal projects. To receive a certificate, you’ll need to finalize and submit an [end-to-end RAG application](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/blob/main/project.md){:target="_blank"}. It allows you to choose a problem that interests you, find a suitable dataset, and develop your model.
