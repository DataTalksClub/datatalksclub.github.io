### Learning in Public

A unique feature is our "learning in public" approach, inspired by [Shawn @swyx Wang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkBCPqWKCL8&list=PL7NIGf5_PlM-Dk3lgPsZFT94Ng7PpRQEh&index=5&t=195s){:target="_blank"}'s [article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public){:target="_blank"}. We believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their level of expertise.

### Building Your Portfolio with Course Projects

If you've ever participated in an interview or conducted online research, you likely understand the significance of personal projects for a machine learning engineer role. Especially in case you don't have any previous experience in machine learning, and it's your first job.

To receive a certificate, you'll need to finalize and submit two projects: one during the midterm ([Midterm project](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master#midterm-project){:target="_blank"}) and another at the end ([Capstone project 1](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master#capstone-project-1){:target="_blank"} and/or [Capstone project 2](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master#capstone-project-2-optional){:target="_blank"}). These projects allow you to choose a problem that interests you, find a suitable dataset, and develop your model. For the capstone project, you are also required to deploy your model as a web service, with the option for local deployment or cloud deployment, earning bonus points.

Students from previous cohorts built a wide range of projects. For example, one graduate created a [blood cell classifier for cancer prediction](https://datatalks.club/blog/how-to-build-blood-cell-classifier-for-cancer-prediction-case-study-from-ml-zoomcamp.html) using deep learning, while another tackled [waste classification](https://datatalks.club/blog/how-to-build-waste-classifier-case-study-from-ml-zoomcamp.html) with over 15,000 images, achieving 93% accuracy. Both projects started from scratch with open datasets, evolved through careful model training and evaluation, and resulted in deployable applications.

For proactive participants, there's an exciting opportunity to engage in an optional project and write an [article](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master#article){:target="_blank"}. The article will require you to conduct research on a topic not covered in the course, encouraging you to explore beyond the curriculum's confines.

You can find all the projects from the year 2022 in the final [leaderboard](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/blob/master/cohorts/2022/leaderboard.md){:target="_blank"}. These projects allow you to apply everything you've learned and make a great addition to your GitHub profile.

The live cohort includes regular office hours with instructors, a structured learning path with deadlines, peer interaction and community support, the opportunity to earn a certificate, and access to all recorded sessions and office hours. Note that even if you're learning at your own pace, you still have access to all course materials and recordings.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I get certified?</strong></summary>

To earn a certificate, you’ll need to finalize and submit two projects: one during the midterm (Midterm project) and another at the end (Capstone project 1 and/or Capstone project 2). You'll also need to review 3 peers' projects by the deadline. Keep in mind that projects must be completed individually, and you must be part of a cohort to be eligible for certification.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I join after the course has started?</strong></summary>

Yes! While you might miss some homework deadlines, you can still join and get certified by completing the required projects. All course materials remain accessible.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What Python knowledge do I need?</strong></summary>

You should be familiar with basic Python concepts like variables, libraries, and Jupyter notebooks. If you need to brush up, we recommend taking our Introduction to Python course first.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What technical setup do I need?</strong></summary>

For machine learning modules, you only need a laptop with internet connection. For deep learning sections, we'll use cloud resources (like Saturn Cloud) for more intensive computations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the balance between theory and practice?</strong></summary>

The course is heavily focused on practical implementation. We cover theoretical concepts at an intuitive level, emphasizing hands-on coding and real-world applications over mathematical derivations.
</details>

<details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between self-paced and cohort learning?</strong></summary>

While all course materials are freely available for self-paced learning, joining a cohort offers additional benefits. You'll get a structured timeline with regular deadlines, active peer learning and discussion, live office hours and troubleshooting support, the opportunity to earn a certificate, and a shared learning experience with others facing similar challenges. The content is the same, but many students find the cohort structure helps them stay motivated and complete the course successfully.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How can I make the most of this course for my career?</strong></summary>

To maximize the course's career impact, we recommend starting your capstone project planning early and building a portfolio-worthy project that solves a real problem. Stay engaged with the Slack community and share your learning journey on social media using #mlzoomcamp. Take time to review and learn from other students' projects. When job hunting, use your project to demonstrate practical skills in applications and interviews - many of our alumni have successfully leveraged their course projects to demonstrate their machine learning capabilities during the hiring process.
