Most companies struggle with machine learning operations. Models get trained, but turning them into reliable, monitored, production systems often falls on ML engineers, data scientists, or whoever “owns” the model—usually without clear processes or tooling. As a result, teams reinvent workflows, rely on ad-hoc scripts, and operate ML systems with limited visibility and no reproducibility.

MLOps Zoomcamp is a free MLOps course designed to close that gap. It teaches you how to put ML models into production using real tools: MLflow, orchestration frameworks, deployment patterns, monitoring, and AWS examples, without drowning you in theory. By the end, you’ll know how to build, deploy, and maintain a complete ML pipeline the way modern teams expect.

## What is MLOps Zoomcamp?

MLOps Zoomcamp is a free MLOps course that takes you from experiment tracking to production deployment in 6 modules plus a portfolio project.

You'll learn infrastructure setup with Docker and AWS, experiment tracking with MLflow, pipeline orchestration with Mage, model deployment (batch, real-time, and streaming), monitoring with Prometheus and Evidently AI, and testing/CI/CD best practices.

The course culminates in a real-world project where you build, deploy, and monitor a complete ML pipeline that you can showcase to employers.

## Why is MLOps Important?

MLOps bridges the gap between model development and production deployment by turning machine learning experiments into reliable, continuously running services. Unlike traditional software, ML systems introduce challenges such as data drift, model degradation, reproducibility issues, and the need for ongoing retraining. These characteristics make MLOps a standalone discipline with its own workflows, tools, and operational requirements. 


Yet, MLOps is still a relatively new field and many organizations struggle with it. In [practitioner surveys](https://mlops.community/3-takeaways-from-our-survey-of-top-ml-teams/), **84.3%** of data scientists and ML engineers report that detecting and diagnosing production model issues is a recurring problem; **26.2%** say it takes one week or more to resolve an issue. Without proper MLOps practices, organizations may spend millions on ML models that don't deliver or can't be sustained.

As machine learning becomes a strategic capability, MLOps is the engine that makes it reliable, maintainable, and scalable. This recognition is driving rapid market growth:

* The global MLOps market [was valued](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/mlops-market-report) at approximately **US $2.19 billion in 2024** and is projected to reach around **US $16.6 billion by 2030**, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~40.5%.
* [Another estimate](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/mlops-market) puts the global MLOps market at **US $1.7 billion in 2024**, with a forecast CAGR of 37.4% through 2034.

## Who is This Course For?

This course is for practitioners who work with machine learning models and want to learn how to operationalize them—from experimentation to deployment, monitoring, and ongoing maintenance. It’s especially relevant for data scientists, ML engineers, and software engineers who are expected to manage the full lifecycle of ML systems.

If you're comfortable with the command line and Python, and you have prior exposure to machine learning and Docker (either from work or from courses like the [ML Zoomcamp](/blog/machine-learning-zoomcamp.html){:target="_blank"}), you have the right background to follow the MLOps Zoomcamp successfully.

### What You'll Build: Course Project

The final part of the course is dedicated to a **hands-on MLOps project** where you apply everything you've learned to build a real, production-ready ML system. This project becomes a strong addition to your portfolio and demonstrates that you understand not only how to train models but also how to **operationalize** them.

You'll:

* **Choose a dataset** that interests you
* **Train a model** and **track experiments** using MLflow or Weights & Biases
* **Build an automated training pipeline** using tools like Mage, Airflow, or Prefect
* **Deploy your model** as a batch job, web service, or streaming system
* **Set up monitoring** with Evidently AI, Prometheus, or Grafana
* **Implement CI/CD workflows** using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD
* **Document your architecture** and make the project reproducible

You have freedom to choose your stack: cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure), orchestration tools, experiment trackers, and monitoring systems, while still following the core MLOps lifecycle required by the course.

Completing the project and reviewing peers’ work is also what qualifies you for the **MLOps Zoomcamp certificate**.

When you join MLOps Zoomcamp, the dedicated Slack channel becomes your daily workspace for troubleshooting, accountability, and celebrating wins with peers following the same modules.

## How to Join MLOps Zoomcamp

You can join MLOps Zoomcamp either by **following a live cohort** or **learning at your own pace**.

All materials are freely available in the [MLOps Zoomcamp GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp). Each module has its own folder, and cohort-specific homework and deadlines are in the `cohorts` directory. Lectures are pre-recorded and available in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hIhxl5Ji8t4O6lPAOpHaCLR).

### Option 1: Self-Paced Learning

Start anytime. You get full access to materials and community support on Slack.

Complete homework assignments: homework and solutions are available on the [course platform](https://courses.datatalks.club). Build a project for your portfolio.

> Under self-paced learning, homework isn't scored, your project isn't peer-reviewed, and you can't earn a certificate.

### Option 2: Live Cohort

Runs once per year (typically starts in the spring).

Includes:
- Updated homework
- Automatic homework scoring and a leaderboard
- Project peer review
- Eligibility for a certificate after meeting all requirements

Even if you join after the official start date, you can still follow along — but note that some homework forms may already be closed. All active deadlines are listed on the [course platform](https://courses.datatalks.club).

> To earn a [certificate](#can-i-get-a-certificate), you'll need enough time to complete one [final project](#project-phase) and the required peer reviews. Details are in the Projects and Certificate sections.
