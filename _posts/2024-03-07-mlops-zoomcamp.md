This not only demonstrates your knowledge but also builds a portfolio of valuable content. Sharing your work online also helps you get noticed by social media algorithms, reaching a broader audience and creating opportunities to connect with individuals and organizations you may not have encountered otherwise.

## Building Your Portfolio with MLOps Projects

If you've been in machine learning interviews or researched MLOps roles, you know that having practical experience with production ML systems is crucial. This is especially important if you're transitioning from data science to MLOps or seeking your first role in the field.

In the final weeks of the course, you'll build an end-to-end MLOps project that showcases everything you've learned. Your project will be peer-reviewed by other participants, providing you with valuable feedback and the opportunity to learn from different approaches to MLOps challenges.
