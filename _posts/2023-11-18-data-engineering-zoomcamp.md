We will describe different aspects of this course so you can learn more about it:

-   Who the course is for?
-   Course curriculum: what topics and technologies are covered by the course
    -   Course project for your portfolio
-   Course assignments and scoring
    -   Homework and getting feedback
    -   Learning in public approach

> The next cohort of the course starts on January 15, 2024. You can find more information about the course [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/){:target="_blank"}. If you’re ready to join, sign up [here](https://airtable.com/appzbS8Pkg9PL254a/shr6oVXeQvSI5HuWD){:target="_blank"}.

### Who the course is for?

Before we get into the details, it’s important to know what skills you should have to join the course comfortably.

Here are the main prerequisites for the course:

-   Skilled in coding
-   Comfortable with the command line
-   Basic SQL



We'll mainly use Python, but if you're not familiar with it yet, it's not a problem. If you’re already programming in another language, you’ll have no trouble picking up Python [here](https://mlbookcamp.com/article/python){:target="_blank"}.

### Week 5: Batch processing

Tech: Spark

**Focus**: Week 5 explores the collection and processing of data blocks.

-   Dive into Spark SQL, DataFrames, and Spark internals.
-   Learn data manipulation techniques like joins.
-   Explore cloud-based options for running Spark more efficiently.



### Week 6: Streaming

**Tech**: Kafka, Stream Processing

**Focus**: Week 6 transitions you from batch to Stream Processing, enabling real-time data handling.

-   Understand Kafka fundamentals, including advanced techniques like stream joins and windowing.
-   Cover Faust and Pyspark for Python-based stream processing.
-   Learn how to use KSQL and ksqlDB for data manipulation.
-   Complete the week by setting up your environment with Docker.



### Weeks 7, 8, 9: Project

**Duration**: 2 weeks for development, 1 week for peer review

**Objective**: The project focuses on applying your acquired skills to build a data engineering pipeline from scratch. Completing this hands-on project not only validates your skills but also enhances your portfolio, offering a competitive edge in job searches.

**Peer Review**: To complete the project, you are required to evaluate projects from at least three of your peers. Failure to do so will result in your project being marked as incomplete. For detailed peer review criteria, check this [link](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_7_project#peer-review-criteria){:target="_blank"}.

**Project Requirements**:

-   Select a Dataset: Choose a dataset that intrigues you
-   Data Lake Pipeline: Create a pipeline to process the selected dataset and store it in a data lake.
-   Data Warehouse Pipeline: Develop another pipeline to move the data from the lake to a data warehouse.
-   Data Transformation: Transform and prepare the data in the warehouse to make it dashboard-ready.
-   Dashboard Creation: Build a dashboard featuring at least two tiles that visually represent your data.



The [course description](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp){:target="_blank"} on GitHub provides a detailed overview of the topics covered each week. You can see the video lectures, slides, code, and community notes for each week of the course to dive into the content. By the end of the course, you will have acquired the fundamental skills necessary for a career as a data engineer.

### Learning in public approach

A unique feature is our "learning in public" approach, inspired by [Shawn @swyx Wang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkBCPqWKCL8&list=PL7NIGf5_PlM-Dk3lgPsZFT94Ng7PpRQEh&index=5&t=195s){:target="_blank"}'s [article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public){:target="_blank"}. We believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their expertise level.

This not only demonstrates your knowledge but also builds a portfolio of valuable content. Sharing your work online also helps you get noticed by social media algorithms, reaching a broader audience and creating opportunities to connect with individuals and organizations you may not have encountered otherwise.

## DataTalks.Club community

DataTalks.Club has a supportive community of like-minded individuals in [our Slack](https://datatalks.club/slack.html){:target="_blank"}. It is the perfect place to enhance your skills, deepen your knowledge, and connect with peers who share your passion. These connections can lead to lasting friendships, potential collaborations in future projects, and exciting career prospects.
