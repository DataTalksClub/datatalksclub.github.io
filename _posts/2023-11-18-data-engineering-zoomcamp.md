Breaking into data engineering takes real, hands-on experience with production tools, but most courses stop at theory.

The Data Engineering Zoomcamp changes that. It's a free data engineering course that teaches you how to build production-grade data pipelines from start to finish. You'll work with Docker, Terraform, BigQuery, dbt, Spark, and Kafka, and graduate with a portfolio project and a certificate.

## What is the Data Engineering Zoomcamp?

Data Engineering Zoomcamp is a 9-week program that follows a clear progression: infrastructure setup, workflow orchestration, data warehousing, analytics engineering, batch processing, streaming, and a final capstone project.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2023-11-18-data-engineering-zoomcamp/data-engineering-zoomcamp-github.png" alt="Data Engineering Zoomcamp GitHub repository - free course materials, homework assignments, and video lectures for learning data engineering" title="Data Engineering Zoomcamp GitHub Repository" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption><p>Data Engineering Zoomcamp GitHub repository showing the course materials</p></figcaption>
</figure>

What makes it different is the community. You'll join an active Slack workspace where thousands of learners troubleshoot together, share progress, and connect for jobs and collaborations. The course encourages learning in public: sharing your work earns bonus points and builds your online presence.

The final three weeks focus on your capstone that gets peer-reviewed, and you graduate with a polished GitHub portfolio that proves you can ship real data systems.

## Why Learn Data Engineering?

Typically, data science teams are comprised of data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. Among different [data roles](/blog/data-roles), data engineers are the guys who connect all the pieces of the data ecosystem within a company or institution.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2020-12-14-data-roles/roles.png" alt="Data team roles list - data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, analytics engineer, and machine learning engineer positions explained" title="Data Team Roles and Responsibilities" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption>

</figure>

But why would you want to become one? Here are some of the main reasons that make data engineering roles satisfactory and valuable:

1. You become the builder behind every data product that keeps information flowing.
2. You increase your earning potential by joining a smaller, high-value pool of professionals.
3. You develop transferable skills that are valuable across industries and provide long-term career flexibility. These skills are also foundational for roles in [machine learning](/blog/machine-learning-zoomcamp.html) and [MLOps](/blog/mlops-zoomcamp.html).
4. You future-proof your career by building a mindset that will stay essential even as tools change and processes get automated.

## Who Can Learn Data Engineering (and What Roles It Leads To)

The great thing about data engineering is that you don't need to be a computer science graduate or have years of experience in data to start.

If you understand basic programming and have curiosity about how data systems work, you can learn data engineering.

If you tick most of the following boxes, data engineering might be a good fit for you:
* Enjoy solving technical, logical problems and building things that work reliably.
* Like Python, SQL, or scripting and want to use those skills for something impactful.
* Want to understand how data moves inside organizations — from raw sources to analysis and AI (including [LLM applications](/blog/llm-zoomcamp.html)).
* Prefer practical, system-level work over purely theoretical or statistical modeling.
* Appreciate clear structure and step-by-step learning (which is how DE Zoomcamp is built).

## Course Prerequisites

As we promised, learning data engineering doesn't require prior data engineering experience.

The course is designed to be accessible to beginners.

The only requirements are:
* Comfort with the command line (basic navigation and file operations)
* Basic SQL knowledge (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN statements)
* Python experience is helpful but not required

If you're completely new to programming, consider spending a few weeks learning the basics before starting the course.

## Course Curriculum: What You’ll Learn in the Data Engineering Zoomcamp

The course follows a logical progression from infrastructure setup to advanced data processing, culminating in an end-to-end project.

You can earn bonus points by learning in public — sharing your work on blogs, YouTube, or social media. And our next section is all about it.

### Learning in Public: Build Your Online Presence

A unique feature is our "learning in public" approach, inspired by [Shawn @swyx Wang](https://datatalks.club/podcast/s03e07-market-yourself.html)'s [article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). We believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their expertise level.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2023-11-18-data-engineering-zoomcamp/learning-in-public-swyx.png" alt="Learning in public concept by Shawn Wang - building online portfolio and sharing data engineering projects publicly for career growth" title="Learn in Public - Shawn Wang Article" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption><p>An extract from Shawn @swyx Wang's article about learning in public</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Throughout the course, we actively encourage and incentivize learning in public. By sharing your progress, insights, and projects online, you earn additional points for your homework and projects.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2023-11-18-data-engineering-zoomcamp/leaderboard-bonus-points.png" alt="Data Engineering Zoomcamp leaderboard with bonus points - students earn extra credit by sharing data engineering projects and learning publicly on social media" title="Leaderboard Bonus Points for Learning in Public" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption><p>Previous cohort's leaderboard highlighting bonus points earned through learning in public activities</p></figcaption>
</figure>

This not only demonstrates your knowledge but also builds a portfolio of valuable content. Sharing your work online also helps you get noticed by social media algorithms, reaching a broader audience and creating opportunities to connect with individuals and organizations you may not have encountered otherwise.

Many of our graduates have shared that their social media presence has helped them attract [job offers](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7380134597839187968/) and [collaborations](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7376510719581646849/).

It serves as a central hub for the course for easier navigation through the course materials. All the lectures are pre-recorded and available on YouTube in our official [Data Engineering Zoomcamp YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb), so you can watch at your own pace.

You can also join the [DataTalks.Club Slack community](https://datatalks.club/slack.html) to get help and support from the community on the (`#course-data-engineering`) channel.

> Remember, self-paced learning does not include homework submissions, project evaluations, or the ability to earn a certificate. To receive certification, you need to join an active cohort.

### Join a Live Cohort

When you join a live cohort, you'll work through the same materials as self-paced learners, but with the added structure of a published schedule and the energy of hundreds of peers progressing alongside you.

Each module typically spans one week, you watch the lectures, complete hands-on exercises, and submit a homework assignment. Your submissions get scored and appear on an anonymous leaderboard.

After completing all six modules, the capstone project phase begins. You'll build your own end-to-end pipeline, submit it through our form, and peer-review at least three other students' projects while yours gets reviewed by your peers. This reciprocal process gives you valuable feedback on your work and exposes you to different approaches and solutions you might not have considered.

**Ready to join DE Zoomcamp?** Here's how it works:

1. [Register for the course](https://airtable.com/appzbS8Pkg9PL254a/shr6oVXeQvSI5HuWD), you'll be automatically accepted into the next cohort
2. Join the [DataTalks.Club Slack community](https://datatalks.club/slack.html) and the `#course-data-engineering` channel for updates, questions, and peer support
3. (Optional) Get a head start by exploring the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and watching lectures before the cohort officially begins
4. When the cohort starts, you'll receive an email with the full schedule and submission deadlines
5. Follow the weekly rhythm: watch lectures, complete exercises, submit homework
6. During the final three weeks, build and submit your capstone project, then peer-review three other projects
7. Receive your certificate once your project passes peer review

The entire journey takes 9 weeks from start to certificate, and you'll be part of a global cohort tackling the same challenges at the same time.
