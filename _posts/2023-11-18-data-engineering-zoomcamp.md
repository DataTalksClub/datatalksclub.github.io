For support, we have an [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19bnYs80DwuUimHM65UV3sylsCn2j1vziPOwzBwQrebw/edit#heading=h.ak8tzux5gjvp){:target="_blank"} section with quick answers to common questions. If you need more help, [our Slack community](https://datatalks.club/slack.html){:target="_blank"} is always available for technical questions, clarifications, or guidance. Additionally, we host live Q&A sessions called "office hours" where you can interact with instructors and get immediate answers to your questions.

### Learning in public approach

A unique feature is our "learning in public" approach, inspired by [Shawn @swyx Wang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkBCPqWKCL8&list=PL7NIGf5_PlM-Dk3lgPsZFT94Ng7PpRQEh&index=5&t=195s){:target="_blank"}'s [article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public){:target="_blank"}. We believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their expertise level.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2023-11-18-data-engineering-zoomcamp/image5.png"  />
<figcaption><p>An extract from Shawn @swyx Wang's article about learning in public</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Throughout the course, we actively encourage and incentivize learning in public. By sharing your progress, insights, and projects online, you earn additional points for your homework and projects.

<figure>

<figcaption><p>Previous cohort's leaderboard highlighting bonus points earned through learning in public activities</p></figcaption>
</figure>

This not only demonstrates your knowledge but also builds a portfolio of valuable content. Sharing your work online also helps you get noticed by social media algorithms, reaching a broader audience and creating opportunities to connect with individuals and organizations you may not have encountered otherwise.

## Building Your Portfolio with Data Engineering Projects

If you've participated in data engineering interviews or researched the field, you know the importance of having real-world projects in your portfolio. This is especially crucial if you're transitioning into data engineering or seeking your first role in the field.

In the final three weeks of the course, you'll build an end-to-end data pipeline project that showcases everything you've learned. Your project will include:

- Selecting and processing a dataset of your choice
- Building data pipelines (batch or streaming)
- Setting up a data warehouse
- Creating analytical dashboards
- Documenting your solution

You'll use modern tools like:
- Cloud platforms (GCP, AWS, or Azure)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Data processing frameworks (Spark, Kafka)
- Analytics tools (dbt, BigQuery)

Your project will be peer-reviewed by other participants, giving you valuable feedback and the opportunity to learn from others' solutions.

Want to make your project stand out? Consider adding extra features like automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, or advanced visualizations. These additions can make your portfolio more impressive to potential employers.
