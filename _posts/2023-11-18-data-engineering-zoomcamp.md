## What is the Data Engineering Zoomcamp?

Data Engineering Zoomcamp is a 9-week program that follows a clear progression: infrastructure setup, workflow orchestration, data warehousing, analytics engineering, batch processing, streaming, and a final capstone project.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2023-11-18-data-engineering-zoomcamp/data-engineering-zoomcamp-github.png" alt="Data Engineering Zoomcamp GitHub repository - free course materials, homework assignments, and video lectures for learning data engineering" title="Data Engineering Zoomcamp GitHub Repository" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption><p>Data Engineering Zoomcamp GitHub repository showing the course materials</p></figcaption>
</figure>

What makes it different is the community. You'll join an active Slack workspace where thousands of learners troubleshoot together, share progress, and connect for jobs and collaborations. The course encourages learning in public: sharing your work earns bonus points and builds your online presence.

The final three weeks focus on your capstone that gets peer-reviewed, and you graduate with a polished GitHub portfolio that proves you can ship real data systems.

## Why Learn Data Engineering?

Typically, data science teams are comprised of data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. Among different [data roles](/blog/data-roles), data engineers are the specialists who connect all the pieces of the data ecosystem within a company or institution.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2020-12-14-data-roles/roles.png" alt="Data team roles list - data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, analytics engineer, and machine learning engineer positions explained" title="Data Team Roles and Responsibilities" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption>

</figure>

But why would you want to become one? Here are some of the main reasons that make data engineering roles rewarding and valuable:

1. You become the builder behind every data product that keeps information flowing.
2. You increase your earning potential by joining a smaller, high-value pool of professionals.
3. You develop transferable skills that are valuable across industries and provide long-term career flexibility. These skills are also foundational for roles in [machine learning](/blog/machine-learning-zoomcamp.html) and [MLOps](/blog/mlops-zoomcamp.html).
4. You future-proof your career by building a mindset that will stay essential even as tools change and processes get automated.

## Who Can Learn Data Engineering (and What Roles It Leads To)

The great thing about data engineering is that you don't need to be a computer science graduate or have years of experience in data to start.

If you understand basic programming and have curiosity about how data systems work, you can learn data engineering.

If you tick most of the following boxes, data engineering might be a good fit for you:
* Enjoy solving technical, logical problems and building things that work reliably.
* Like Python, SQL, or scripting and want to use those skills for something impactful.
* Want to understand how data moves inside organizations — from raw sources to analysis and AI (including [LLM applications](/blog/llm-zoomcamp.html)).
* Prefer practical, system-level work over purely theoretical or statistical modeling.
* Appreciate clear structure and step-by-step learning (which is how DE Zoomcamp is built).

## Course Prerequisites

As mentioned earlier, learning data engineering doesn't require prior data engineering experience.

The course is designed to be accessible to beginners.

The only requirements are:
* Comfort with the command line (basic navigation and file operations)
* Basic SQL knowledge (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN statements)
* Python experience is helpful but not required

If you're completely new to programming, consider spending a few weeks learning the basics before starting the course.

## Course Curriculum: What You’ll Learn in the Data Engineering Zoomcamp

The course follows a logical progression from infrastructure setup to advanced data processing, culminating in an end-to-end project.

You can earn bonus points by learning in public — sharing your work on blogs, YouTube, or social media. The next section explains how it works in practice.

### Learning in Public: Build Your Online Presence

A unique feature is our "learning in public" approach, inspired by [Shawn @swyx Wang](https://datatalks.club/podcast/s03e07-market-yourself.html)'s [article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). We believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their expertise level.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2023-11-18-data-engineering-zoomcamp/learning-in-public-swyx.png" alt="Learning in public concept by Shawn Wang - building online portfolio and sharing data engineering projects publicly for career growth" title="Learn in Public - Shawn Wang Article" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption><p>An extract from Shawn @swyx Wang's article about learning in public</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Throughout the course, we actively encourage and incentivize learning in public. By sharing your progress, insights, and projects online, you earn additional points for your homework and projects.

<figure>
<img src="/images/posts/2023-11-18-data-engineering-zoomcamp/leaderboard-bonus-points.png" alt="Data Engineering Zoomcamp leaderboard with bonus points - students earn extra credit by sharing data engineering projects and learning publicly on social media" title="Leaderboard Bonus Points for Learning in Public" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" />
<figcaption><p>Previous cohort's leaderboard highlighting bonus points earned through learning in public activities</p></figcaption>
</figure>

This not only demonstrates your knowledge but also builds a portfolio of valuable content. Sharing your work online also helps you get noticed by social media algorithms, reaching a broader audience and creating opportunities to connect with individuals and organizations you may not have encountered otherwise.

Many of our graduates have shared that their social media presence has helped them attract [job offers](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7380134597839187968/) and [collaborations](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7376510719581646849/).

### Learn at Your Own Pace

The self-paced mode lets you start immediately and progress on your own schedule. You'll get access to the course materials and the community and can complete the course at a pace that works for you.

All you need is to go to the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and start learning. It serves as a central hub for the course for easier navigation through the course materials. All the lectures are pre-recorded and available on YouTube in our official [Data Engineering Zoomcamp YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb), so you can watch whenever it suits you.

You can also join the [DataTalks.Club Slack community](https://datatalks.club/slack.html) to get help and support from the community in the `#course-data-engineering` channel. Homework and solutions are available on the [course platform](https://courses.datatalks.club), and you can build a project for your portfolio.

> Remember, self-paced learning does not include homework submissions, project evaluations, or the ability to earn a certificate. To receive certification, you need to join an active cohort.

### Join a Live Cohort

> **2026 Cohort:** Starts January 2026. Register here: [Fill in this form](https://airtable.com/appzbS8Pkg9PL254a/shr6oVXeQvSI5HuWD)

When you join a live cohort, you'll work through the same materials as self-paced learners, but with the added structure of a published schedule and the energy of hundreds of peers progressing alongside you.

The course runs once per year (starts around January). Each module typically spans one week: you watch the lectures, complete hands-on exercises, and submit a homework assignment. Your submissions get scored and appear on an anonymous leaderboard.

After completing all six modules, the capstone project phase begins. You'll build your own end-to-end pipeline, submit it through our form, and peer-review at least three other students' projects while yours gets reviewed by your peers. This reciprocal process gives you valuable feedback on your work and exposes you to different approaches and solutions you might not have considered.

Even if you join after the official start date, you can still follow along — but note that some homework forms may already be closed. All active deadlines are listed on the [course platform](https://courses.datatalks.club).

> To earn a [certificate](#how-to-get-a-certificate), you'll need enough time to complete one [final project](#capstone-project) and the required peer reviews. Details are in the Projects and Certificate sections.

**Ready to join DE Zoomcamp?** Here's how it works:

1. [Register for the course](https://airtable.com/appzbS8Pkg9PL254a/shr6oVXeQvSI5HuWD), you'll be automatically accepted into the next cohort
2. Join the [DataTalks.Club Slack community](https://datatalks.club/slack.html) and the `#course-data-engineering` channel for updates, questions, and peer support
3. (Optional) Get a head start by exploring the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and watching lectures before the cohort officially begins
4. When the cohort starts, you'll receive an email with the full schedule and submission deadlines
5. Follow the weekly rhythm: watch lectures, complete exercises, submit homework
6. During the final three weeks, build and submit your capstone project, then peer-review three other projects
7. Receive your certificate once your project passes peer review

The entire journey takes 9 weeks from start to certificate, and you'll be part of a global cohort tackling the same challenges at the same time.

> Three months might seem like a long time, but the growth and learning during this period are truly remarkable. It was a great experience with a lot of learning, connecting with like-minded people from all around the world, and having fun. I must admit, this was really hard. But the feeling of accomplishment and learning made it all worthwhile. And I would do it again!
