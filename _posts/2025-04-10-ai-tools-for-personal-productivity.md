In this article, we present key findings on usage patterns, application areas, and emerging trends among technical professionals.

## Introduction

AI tools are increasingly integral to both personal and professional activities. While many professionals enjoy the efficiency gains these tools offer, a subset of respondents also expressed concerns about potential overreliance.

This survey sheds light on how technical professionals use AI, which tools are most prevalent, and the tangible impacts on productivity.

Let's explore what we've found out!

## AI Tools Integration

Our survey shows that AI is now a routine part of daily life.

          data-type="pie"
          data-title="How often do you use AI for work or personal tasks?"
          data-labels='["Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly"]'
          data-values='[70.1, 27.1, 2.8]'
          data-height='300px'>
  </canvas>

</figure>

Key findings include:

-   **Daily usage:** About 70% of respondents use AI tools every day, both at work and at home.
-   **User maturity:** A majority (70%) have been using AI for over a year, with roughly 40.2% using it for 1–2 years and 30.3% for more than 2 years. This indicates a mature user base that has incorporated AI into routine tasks. These users feel at ease with AI tools and rely on their capabilities.

<figure>
  <canvas class="ai-chart"
          data-type="pie"
          data-title="How long have you been using AI?"
          data-labels='["Less than 6 months", "6 months to 1 year", "1–2 years", "More than 2 years"]'
          data-values='[4.0, 25.5, 40.2, 30.3]'>
  </canvas>

          data-type="bar"
          data-orientation="horizontal"
          data-title="If you use AI, for what kind of tasks do you use them?"
          data-labels='["Coding assistance", "Research assistance", "Brainstorming", "Personal productivity", "Content generation", "Data analysis"]'
          data-values='[87.7, 72.3, 68.8, 58.9, 46.6, 39.9]'>
  </canvas>

</figure>

Given the technical focus of our community, the AI applications include:

-   **Coding assistance (87.7%)**: AI tools are extensively used to generate code, debug, and improve overall efficiency.
-   **Research assistance (72.3%)**: Many professionals rely on AI to quickly gather and summarize information.
-   **Brainstorming and personal productivity:** Interestingly, brainstorming (68.8%) and personal productivity tasks (58.9%) are the next largest use cases.
-   **Content generation (46.6%):** Nearly half of the respondents use AI to streamline content creation.
-   **Data analysis (39.9%):** Data analysis is less popular, with only 40% of people using AI tools for this task, which likely highlights that the reasoning capabilities of AI tools are still developing.

## Tools

We see that ChatGPT dominates the market, but we also use other tools such as Claude or Gemini.

### Chat-Based Tools

<figure>
  <canvas class="ai-chart"
          data-type="bar"
          data-orientation="horizontal"
          data-title="Which chat-based applications do you use?"
          data-labels='["ChatGPT", "Anthropic Claude", "Google Gemini"]'
          data-values='[92.1, 32.9, 43.3]'>
  </canvas>
  <figcaption>Most respondents use ChatGPT by a wide margin</figcaption>
</figure>

While the market for chat-based AI tools is diversifying, a few key players continue to dominate it.

-   **ChatGPT:** Leads the market with 92.1% usage among respondents.
-   **Complementary tools:** **Google Gemini** and **Anthropic Claude** are used by smaller segments, often as complementary tools **alongside ChatGPT** rather than as stand-alone solutions.
-   Other platforms, like Perplexity or Copilot, trail behind.

### AI Integration into IDEs

AI-driven coding assistance is becoming standard practice in the tech community. People use AI tools in **technical workflows** rather than just for general productivity tasks.

<figure>
  <canvas class="ai-chart"
          data-type="bar"
          data-orientation="horizontal"
          data-title="Which IDEs or plugins do you use for development?"
          data-labels='["GitHub Copilot", "Cursor"]'
          data-values='[78.1, 19.9]'>
  </canvas>
  <figcaption>GitHub Copilot is the most popular AI development tool</figcaption>
</figure>

Among developer-focused tools:

-   **GitHub Copilot:** It is the most popular, with **77.9% of respondents utilizing it.** This popularity likely stems from its development by the widely recognized platform GitHub, which is used by nearly everyone in the tech community.
-   At the same time, **newer and less popular applications like Cursor** still maintain a user base of 20% and are likely to grow.

### Additional AI Tools 

When asked about additional AI tools, respondents mentioned using a **wide variety of niche tools** for tasks such as image generation, voice synthesis, and even custom frameworks.

Notable mentions include:

-   Advanced code generation and debugging beyond standard IDE plugins.
-   Image generation (e.g., DALL-E) and voice synthesis.
-   Specialized platforms for search, summarization, and home automation.

These free-form responses illustrate that professionals are experimenting with a diverse ecosystem to meet specific needs instead of relying on popular AI applications for all tasks.

## Impact on Productivity

In general, how has AI impacted the lives of our community members?

According to their responses, AI integration has been beneficial for nearly everyone, with the main impacts being:

-   **Efficiency, time-saving, and productivity:** AI reduces the time required for routine tasks, leading to faster work completion.
-   **Better focus:** Outsourcing routine tasks to concentrate on higher-value activities.
-   **Improved communication and documentation:** AI assists with drafting emails, technical documents, and specifications.

Here's a summary table of the main insights regarding the impact of AI and some quotes from our respondents:
