### How do I participate in the courses? Self-paced mode vs. cohort mode

All course materials are freely accessible on DataTalks.Club's GitHub page. You can choose from two modes of learning:

-   Self-paced mode: Ideal for individuals who prefer to learn at their own pace or are interested in specific topics from the course. In this mode, you cannot submit homework for review or receive a certificate. For those features, consider the alternative mode.
-   Cohort mode: This mode enables participants to earn a certificate by timely completing and submitting the required course project(s). Additional benefits include homework submission for feedback, participation in online office hours to ask your questions, and access to bonus workshops and other online events organized for some cohorts.

### Key aspects of our courses

-   **Blending Theory and Practice:** We cover the key concepts of each topic, and then give you the chance to put what you've learned into practice.
-   **Course Materials:** Alongside video lectures, we provide code demos to bring the concepts to life. This way, you get to see how these ideas work in practice, not just in theory.
-   **Homework:** After each module, we assign homework. It's your opportunity to test your understanding.
-   **The Final Project:** At the end of the course, you'll tackle a final project. This is where you can apply everything from the course to create an end-to-end project and enhance your portfolio.
-   **DataTalks.Club Community:** Our community is here to support you. Through our Slack channel, you can ask questions, share insights, or simply connect with fellow learners and instructors.

This course is perfect for those who want to understand the fundamentals of machine learning and learn to use the main ML frameworks and tools. The only requirement for this course is prior programming experience (1+ year) and familiarity with the command line.

You don’t have to have any prior knowledge of machine learning as we’ll guide you from the very basics to advanced topics. The course is divided into two parts:

-   Part 1 covers machine learning algorithms implemented in Python, including Linear Regression, Classification, Decision Trees, Ensemble Learning, and Neural Networks.
-   Part 2 focuses on deploying models using popular frameworks like Flask, TensorFlow, and Kubernetes.

This course will teach you data-driven decision-making, using popular Python libraries to work with financial data from data types and cleaning to hypothesis testing and making predictions. Also, it will cover the basics of trading strategies and simulation. As a result, you will build a semi-automatic trading system to systematically generate predictions and execute trades.

You need basic Python knowledge, an analytical mindset to make decisions based on data, and a keen interest in financial markets to apply the knowledge immediately to succeed in this course.

-   Week 1: Introduction and Data Sources
-   Week 2: Working with the Data (in Pandas)
-   Week 3: Analytical Modeling
-   Week 4: Trading Strategy and Simulation

-   Introduction to LLMs and RAG
-   Open-source and self-hosting LLMs
-   Vector databases
-   LLM Orchestration
-   Monitoring and guardrails
-   Tips and tricks
