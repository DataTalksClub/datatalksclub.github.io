    text: "Like I posted in previous answer to Kevin\u2019s post above, I believe\

      \ value and insight into how these black boxes work. It really depends on how\
      \ seriously you want to become a subject matter expert on a given topic, and\
      \ of course you have to prioritize what you learn. \nin my book, I teach how\
      \ to do gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent from scratch for linear\
      \ regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. For the first two of\
      \ those I show how to do that without NumPy!\nWhat you study after the book\
      \ is dependent on your goals and what problems interest you. in the last chapter\
      \ I emphasize it\u2019s truly a \u201Cchoose your own adventure\u201D based\
      \ on what you want to pursue! It wouldn\u2019t be right for me to presume what\

      \ when nobody else is. We live in a strange corporate culture where people don\u2019\
      t ask questions, especially the \u201Celephant in the room\u201D ones that people\
      \ are afraid to ask (maybe out of fear they are missing something, or appearing\
      \ ignorant?) I actually give this a name in my book, the Jabberwocky Effect.\n\
      What I find surreal is asking questions, especially the uncomfortable ones that\
      \ challenge popular assumptions, really took me for a ride. It frustrated some\
      \ folks, but I got relieved gratitude from others simply by cutting through\
      \ narratives and seeking grounded information. I now teach at University of\
      \ Southern California advising government, military, and aerospace agencies\

      \ Just be curious, tell people you\u2019re confused, and you need help understanding.\
      \ At worst you learn something new and show you aren\u2019t afraid to admit\

    in the book of calculus, probability, linear algebra, and statistics, do you address
    (or do you have any thoughts on) other areas such as Optimization (which is of
    course highly related to linear algebra and calculus)?

    The reason I ask is that I have sometimes seen candidates or colleagues approach
    a task by devising complex machine learning models, when in fact all that was
    really required was to solve a non-linear equation, for example.

    Update:

    I see that you''ve already mentioned this in your last answer to Christian , so
    my question would be then be - what do you advise those who do not come with significant
    academic grounding in mathematics in choosing the appropriate technique for a
    task (like the scenario above)?'

    text: "Glad you discovered my answer to your first question. I do talk about optimization\
      \ a bit in my book, and I even throw a section on linear programming in the\
      \ appendix. I would have loved to include a chapter on metaheuristics and optimization,\
      \ like the traveling salesman problem. But I had a 350 page book already so\
      \ I just mention these other techniques. \nWhat\u2019s funny about academics\
      \ and people with PhDs is they often are hyper specialized in their own rabbit\
      \ holes. Many are much better writing papers on the HOW rather than the WHY.\
      \ They can fill a whole whiteboard full of Greek symbols and impressive math\
      \ equations, but handwave over the silliness it is an algorithm to separate\
      \ pictures of hot dogs from dachshunds wearing hot dog costumes. What value\
      \ does this create? So you have to take the academic gravitas with a grain of\
      \ salt, but there are exceptionally talented academics of course who do valuable\
      \ work. There are a few I look up to. \nA Cherry-picked  example though is a\
      \ secondhand account from a colleague who went to a predictive modeling conference.\
      \ A PhD candidate created an elaborate model trying to pinpoint factors causing\
      \ a major airport to have sudden delay problems. During his presentation full\
      \ of theories, data,  and regression models, my colleague said \u201Cthe airport\
      \ closed a terminal for construction this year! Your model is not at all accounting\
      \ for this!\u201D He reacted sheepishly and carried on, even though a quick\
      \ Google search nullifies his entire project as the delay cause was well known.\n\
      The question then becomes how do you stand out and have a skill set most academics\
      \ do not have? I think the best answer to that is to have more awareness of\
      \ business context and what\u2019s practical, not having deep specialization\
      \ in one topic with little insight on the overlap with the real world. I hate\
      \ to sound like I\u2019m advocating becoming a \u201Cjack of trades, master\
      \ of none\u201D but there is so much information and complexity out there. Special\
      \ interests are selling silver bullets to get more funding and investors. Somebody\

    text: 'Wow thanks a lot for the considered response!  That''s a great and memorable
      anecdote about making sure you keep practical context and current available

      So in other words.... there''s just as much danger in applying too much academic
      theory as not enough, possibly more so?!

      I suppose from the point of view of practical statistics, this would tie in
      somewhat about checking your assumptions (and indeed your biases) at the outset
      of the project. And of course Occam''s Razor is always good to keep in mind
      - actually Alexey, the creator of this group, has something similar at the beginning
      of his Machine Learning book.  Namely, ask yourself whether an ML model is actually

    text: "For staying up to speed, what\u2019s funny is I spend a lot of time studying\
      \ classical statistics and finding how much has been forgotten by contemporary\
      \ practices. I try to understand how that progression happened, and more often\
      \ than not it\u2019s a little scary how messy things have become.\nI read a\
      \ lot of books (Aurelian Geron\u2019s on Machine Learning is fantastic) but\
      \ synthesize information from a lot of disparate sources, from research papers\
      \ to YouTube videos. For data-adjacent I read WSJ and nonfiction books. Most\
      \ importantly I do targeted research and try to pursue information relevant\
      \ to what I\u2019m interested in, while occasionally chasing my tail with what\

    text: Very interesting (Tesla etc.). For sure it would benefit the public and
      indeed our field if stats and data were better understood - indeed that's why
      How to Lie With Statistics  was written, among others. I just hadn't considered
      that there were now such huge vested interests against it.

  text: 'Hi Thomas Nield I remembered from my time at college that my math teacher
    used to say that probably we would never perform matrix multiplication manually
    and we should learn the tools (at college maple) and understand what we were doing
    instead remembering how to perform those operation manually.

    What is your opinion about it?'

    text: "Good question. I say this in the last chapter of my book, but what you\
      \ learn has to be prioritized. I can\u2019t tell you how a regular expression\
      \ compiles but I am very good at using them. I have no reason to go down that\
      \ rabbit hole unless my job suddenly needs me to become a subject matter expert\
      \ on the ins and outs of regular expressions\u2026 and that\u2019s the key determining\
      \ factor!\nBut for things like machine learning, and if you want to practice\
      \ machine learning, it is beneficial to attempt building a linear regression,\
      \ logistic regression, and neural network from scratch  at least once.  And\
      \ yes my book covers this! This requires some matrix multiplication, but by\
      \ doing this exercise you can speak to the libraries you use with more insight\
      \ and subject matter expertise. That\u2019s not just invaluable but arguably\
      \ necessary.\nSo it really depends on how much knowledge authority you need\
      \ on a subject, and whether doing a deep dive into the black box has strategic\
      \ value. Machine learning is a topic that very few people actually understand\
      \ and yet are making strategic decisions on, so it might be a liability to just\
      \ have a black box understanding and nothing more."
