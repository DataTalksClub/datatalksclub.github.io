  text: Hi Luca Massaron Konrad Banachewicz, thanks for being here! My question is,
    how to get started with Kaggle? Is it something like Leetcode where there's a
    problem statement and we start coding? As a beginner, do we just dive into ongoing
    competitions or practice a bit with older competitions? I am really wondering
    on how to get started with Kaggle, want to test my knowledge of basic concepts,
    and learn new things by reading others's code, but don't know how to get started.

      \ Book as book of the week!\nBreaking the ice is one of the difficult things\
      \ with Kaggle. I suggest you first should try participating in introductory\
      \ competitions such the Titanic one ([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?hostSegmentIdFilter=5](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?hostSegmentIdFilter=5))\
      \ or, since they are more lively and bit more challenging to Tabular playground\
      \ competitions ([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?hostSegmentIdFilter=8](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?hostSegmentIdFilter=8)).\
      \  By doing that you can get rapidly a working knowledge of how Kaggle works\
      \ and find your best way to enjoy about Kaggle and that\u2019s not necessarily\
      \ by competitions, you can participate in many ways, by writing your code doing\
      \ eda or modelling, by studying others\u2019 notebooks, by discussing on the\
      \ forums about the possible solutions to the challenge, It is all up to you\
      \ what you find more useful for learning."

    text: Thank you very much Luca! Thanks for providing the links too, much appreciated!
      I usually practice on jupyter notebook/google colab, and am really excited to
      compete on Kaggle, but never knew how. Thanks for providing your valuable insights!
      And all the very best for your book!

      in most cases. In the majority of competitions, which are deep learning ones,
      usually the SOTA / most recent architectures tend to win if used properly and
      are, again, ensembled.

  text: "Hi Luca Massaron Konrad Banachewicz. Thanks for bringing the book.\nMy question\

    \ domain knowledge faster and transfer the experience and learning from competition\

      \ are topics for the competitions and you will get a sense of what could work\
      \ and couldn\u2019t in a specific situation. You will be shown the best performing\

    text: 'as for as the progression in Kaggle rankings, the progression system has
      some requirements: [https://www.kaggle.com/progression](https://www.kaggle.com/progression),
      thus for instance it takes at least a few competitions with the right medals
      to achieve the level you want. Said that, in my experience is just a matter
      of time and efforts you put on it. The more time and efforts, the less it will
      take as a general rule but the exact time depends also on your starting level
      of skill, how fast you learn, and also if you have good machines at your disposal
      for fast experimentation and prototyping. Since you learn by doing, also doing
      faster (because your machine can train or process the data in a faster way)
      will accelerate your learning.'

      \ data and tried to build a basic model to check if the dataset really answered\

      \ fidelity and if the data is maintained. Fidelity is an issue if the data has\
