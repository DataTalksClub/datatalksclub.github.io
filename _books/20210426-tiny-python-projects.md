A long journey is really a lot of little steps. The same is true when you're learning Python,
so you may as well have some fun along the way! Written in a lighthearted style with entertaining
exercises that build powerful skills, Tiny Python Projects takes you from amateur to Pythonista as
you create 22 bitesize programs. Each tiny project teaches you a new programming concept, from the
basics of lists and strings right through to regular expressions and randomness. Along the way you'll
also discover how testing can make you a better programmer in any language.
