We all learn through trial and error. We avoid the things that cause us to experience
pain and failure. We embrace and build on the things that give us reward and success.
This common pattern is the foundation of deep reinforcement learning: building machine
learning systems that explore and learn based on the responses of the environment.

Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning introduces this powerful machine learning approach,
using examples, illustrations, exercises, and crystal-clear teaching. You'll love the
perfectly paced teaching and the clever, engaging writing style as you dig into this
awesome exploration of reinforcement learning fundamentals, effective deep learning
techniques, and practical applications in this emerging field.
