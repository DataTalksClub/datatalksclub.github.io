Machine Learning Engineering is a roadmap to delivering successful machine learning projects.
It teaches you to adopt an efficient, sustainable, and goal-driven approach that author
Ben Wilson has developed over a decade of data science experience. Every method in this book
has been used to solve a breakdown in a real-world project, and is illustrated with production-ready
source code and easily reproducible examples.

You’ll learn how to plan and scope your project, manage cross-team logistics that avoid fatal
communication failures, and design your code’s architecture for improved resilience. You’ll
even discover when not to use machine learning—and the alternative approaches that might be
cheaper and more effective. When you’re done working through this toolbox guide, you’ll be
able to reliably deliver cost-effective solutions for organizations big and small alike.
