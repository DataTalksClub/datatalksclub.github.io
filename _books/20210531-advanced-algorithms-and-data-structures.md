As a software engineer, you’ll encounter countless programming challenges that initially
seem confusing, difficult, or even impossible. Don’t despair! Many of these “new” problems
already have well-established solutions. Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures teaches
you powerful approaches to a wide range of tricky coding challenges that you can adapt and
apply to your own applications. Providing a balanced blend of classic, advanced, and new
algorithms, this practical guide upgrades your programming toolbox with new perspectives
and hands-on techniques.
