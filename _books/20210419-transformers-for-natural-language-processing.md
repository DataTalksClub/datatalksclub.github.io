The transformer architecture has proved to be revolutionary in outperforming the classical RNN
and CNN models in use today. With an apply-as-you-learn approach, Transformers for Natural
Language Processing investigates in vast detail the deep learning for machine translations,
speech-to-text, text-to-speech, language modeling, question answering, and many more NLP domains with transformers.

The book takes you through NLP with Python and examines various eminent models and datasets
within the transformer architecture created by pioneers such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft,
OpenAI, and Hugging Face.
