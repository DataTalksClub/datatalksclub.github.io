Relationships in data often look far more like a web than an orderly set of rows and columns.
Graph databases shine when it comes to revealing valuable insights within complex, interconnected
data such as demographics, financial records, or computer networks.

In Graph Databases in Action, experts Dave Bechberger and Josh Perryman illuminate the design and
implementation of graph databases in real-world applications. You'll learn how to choose the right
database solutions for your tasks, and how to use your new knowledge to build agile, flexible,
and high-performing graph-powered applications!
