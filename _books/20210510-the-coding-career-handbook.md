    Thank you for the book. It seems to have a lot of valuable advice for Software
    Developers on how to build their careers wisely. How do you think, would this
    book also help other professionals such as Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data
    Analysts?'

    How do you think coders approach their careers differently compared to people
    in other roles? Do they have specific strengths/weaknesses?'

    text: "hey Dustin! hmm, this is hard to answer because I dont know what you have\
      \ in mind by \u201Cpeople in other roles\u201D. We have unique challenges \u2014\
      \ a lot of the time the quality and productivity of coders is hard to measure,\
      \ compared to say, a marketer or a recruiter \u2014 but also unique opportunities,\

    people with not extensive free time at hand to do it? People are generally busy
    with one of the following, just some examples: extensive work at office, family

      \ ideas:\n- reuse your work - create reusable resources and blogposts out of\

      - set aside 1-2 hours before work every day \u2014 this is consistently the\
      \ best time to do this out of all the dev creators i interview\n- take a codecation\
      \ [https://thoughtbot.com/blog/you-should-take-a-codecation](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/you-should-take-a-codecation)\n\
      - scope down your ambitions and perfectionism\nwhen you talk about needing \u201C\
      extensive free time\u201D to build public image i suspect you are viewing this\
      \ as a lot of extra work. when you can see how to break it down and also see\

  text: Also, I saw you mentioned in your `Learn in Public` post that it's the fastest
    way to build a "second brain." Is that idea at all related to 
    [https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com)?
    Someone in my network who introduced me to your writing years ago also took this
    course. If it's related, how has this idea of building a second brain impacted

      \ now \U0001F642  i wrote the LIP essay 2 years before BASB, but the course\
      \ has helped solidify my understanding of notetaking and helped me understand\
      \ what pain points other people have.\ni would say a big difference is that\
      \ BASB is very inward facing - more focused on your notetaking system - whereas\
      \ LIP is by nature more focused on public output."
  - name: Glenn
    text: Oh very cool! I just started using Obsidian last year and a lot of content
      related to it on YouTube mentions BASB. I need to build better note-taking habits
      with it, but being able to write in markdown and see how all the notes are connected
      in the graph view makes it a lot of fun

      1. what do you really want to build and what helps you get there? (games, blog,

      2. what do the interesting employers in your area seem to be hiring for?'

  text: In your sample marketing chapter, you mentioned how you love Svelte and React.
    In your opinion, when would you reach for Svelte first? I used to write a lot
    of React, but switched domains right before Svelte gained more popularity.

      \ - @SvelteSociety on twitter is me \U0001F642 i think a good skill to develop\
      \ is betting on technologies just before they cross the chasm - something i\
      \ touch on in the strategy chapters"
  - name: Glenn
    text: I'd be interested in learning a little bit more about your process in choosing
      which technologies to bet on. I bet on SwiftUI pretty early and a couple of
      years ago, I switched from my company's frontend team to iOS. React was more
      similar to SwiftUI than what my iOS teammates had ever worked on, so I was much
      more productive than all of my them out of the gate. I still think SwiftUI is
      the future, but I didn't realize how slow the mobile space moves compared to
      web so sometimes I feel like I bet on it too early.

    text: "oh! it always feels like that i suspect. objc was clearly not going to\
      \ vanish overnight the moment swiftui was launched, but you can see apple moving\
      \ more and more over to it. i wouldnt be worried about it, as long as apple\
      \ doesnt suddenly deprecate it overnight then you\u2019re just playing a long\
      \ game"

  text: Hello swyx! Thank you for taking the time to answer questions. I wanted to
    ask, for a lot of companies how well you interview via Leetcode-style questions
    seems to be more important than a personal brand/public image. As such, what specific
    advantages does a public image provide to navigate the interview process?
  replies:
  - name: swyx
    text: hey Anika! well I have personally been able to skip some technical interviews
      because the interviewer has seen me livecode or attended a workshop of mine.
      however not all companies will do that.
  - name: swyx
    text: still, almost everyone googles you or looks up your profile before interviewing
      you. if you can demonstrate proof of your expertise in a difficult field (eg
      speaking at a well known conference, publishing in a well regarded publication,
      repo with lots of stars) then it can help to reassure the interviewer.
  - name: swyx
    text: at the end of the day the interview process is a risk minimization framework,
      people are looking for clear strengths and lack of critical weakness, and a
      public profile can help with both.

    text: Thank you !

  text: 'Another question: if you are trying to get into a role that you aren''t in
    yet (eg transitioning from traditional SWE to ML/data engineer), besides building
    things in public, what else can you do to not get boxed in to the same role that
    you have professional experience in?'
  replies:
  - name: swyx
    text: important question! make sure your resume reflects all the work that youve
      done towards the identity that you want to have, not what you used to have
  - name: swyx
    text: "then think about doing internal transfers rather than trying to go in by\
      \ the \u201Cfront door\u201D. in other words - its much easier to join the company\
      \ first and transition to that role internally (often by volunteering to do\
      \ extra work for that role)  than it is to pass the interview bar for the new\
      \ role direclty"

  text: What's the number one thing you'd recommend doing for people who want to become
    senior devs?
  replies:
  - name: swyx
    text: write more - documentation, internal design docs, sprint retrospective.
      document what you did and how you did it and make sure people know what you
      did (marketing) and you distill lessons from your experience (teaching, identifying
      core principles)

  text: How important is social media accounts in coding career, in your opinion?
    Can we get around in our career without them?

      \ networking! so\u2026 highly recommended, so long as you dont get addicted\
      \ to their worst properties."

  text: "Not related to the book, but it's more about this \"second brain\" thing.\
