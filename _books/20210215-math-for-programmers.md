  text: 'Hi Paul, my questions are:

    Are there topics that you really want to cover in the book, but decided against
    in the end?'
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: There are a lot of topics I wish I could have included!  Originally, I wanted
      to write about abstract algebra and functional programming.  This is a bit more
      advanced, and so I decided with my publisher to focus on topics that were more
      accessible and interesting to a broader audience.  Also, there's not much on
      probability or statistics in this one -- I hope to write another book on "statistics
      for programmers" soon.

  text: 'Most of the topics in the list of contents seems more or less fairly general,
    except the chapter on gravity simulation-- what made you add that particular topic?'
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: I tried to have at least one application in each chapter -- the new math
      in that chapter is the concept of partial derivatives and the gradient.  I think
      that force fields are a useful example to think of when learning about the gradient,
      which is why I picked it!

  text: 'In the intro, you mentioned that you wrote it partly with the idea of ''scientific
    software engineer'' in mind-- it''s not a job description I see very often, outside
    of universities, where do these jobs come up? And what sort of skills do they
    usually look for? (ie do they assume you''ll have a background in the science
    as well?)'
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: Job titles vary, but some software engineer job postings require more math
      than others.  I would say there are a lot of data science and quantitative finance
      jobs out there that require math, as well as software eng. jobs at high-tech
      companies (e.g. aerospace, biotech, hardware)

    text: I wish I could tell you! My publisher (Manning) has a tradition of putting
      people in old-fashioned dress on their covers.  This woman is wearing traditional
      dress from Finland from a few hundred years ago.  I picked this one from three
      options, because I like her smirk!  No idea what she is doing with her hand...
      but it almost looks to me like she's gesturing at a blackboard

  text: "Hey Paul Orland , great book \U0001F44F\U0001F3FC, this is definitely something\
    \ I want to expand my understanding in some more.\nI like that you\u2019ve added\
    \ exercises at the end of the topics; How did you get your ideas for the exercises\
    \ you listed? Are they short questions to test understanding or small practical\
    \ project styled etc?"
  replies: []
- name: Paul Orland
  text: Glad you're enjoying it so far!  Good question.  I've designed most of the
    exercises to be doable in 1-15 minutes
  replies: []
- name: Paul Orland
  text: They are supposed to be relatively quick checks of your understanding, to
    help you make sure you are keeping up with the material.  Then, if one takes longer
    than a few minutes to figure out, it's a good sign you should reread the chapter
    and think through the topic again.
  replies: []
- name: Paul Orland
  text: Anything more involved is marked as a "mini project", indicating that it will
    take what you've learned and go a bit beyond the material introduced in the text.
  replies: []
- name: Paul Orland
  text: 'The way I come up with these is roughly: I think of some small example I
    could work through in a paragraph, and rather than explaining it, I try to give
    a carefully worded hint so you can basically connect the dots and figure it out
    yourself.'

  text: Hi Paul Orland, glad to converse with you. Are you covering the mathematical
    fundamentals needed for computer vision ( I saw you were covering 3D graphics)
    such as various image transforms. Thanks.
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: Hmm... I don't know much about computer vision in general, so I can't say
      for sure. I bet many of the topics in the book are used in computer vision.  And,
      the last chapter is on image recognition using neural networks!
  - name: Poornima
    text: "That sounds great !\U0001F642 Will give it a try and thank you for answering."

  text: 'Hello, Paul Orland!  Thanks for doing this.  My question(s): if you were
    going to expand your book, what would you add?  What would you expand?  What would
    you cut?'
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: I would definitely add some content on probability and statistics!  I think
      it is increasingly important math for applications, and I'm sad it didn't fit
      in this book. It's also not my area of expertise.  I think most of the big topics
      in the current book are good, but if I could do it again, I might trim down
      some of the les useful sections and subsections (not thinking of any off the
      top of my head, but there are surely some!)
  - name: Matthew Emerick
    text: I agree that statistics and probability are very important. I also think
      that too many rely on them without full understanding. Do you think machine
      learning engineers, data scientists, and AI practitioners in general need to
      focus more on math?
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: I suppose most engineers, data scientists, etc. know the math they "need"
      to do their jobs, but I suspect there is room for most people to think more
      deeply about the math they use.  In my book, I've tried to emphasize the philosophy
      behind each topic, as in why it is the way it is, and how it fits into the grand
      scheme of things. This perspective, I think, is similar to a software engineer
      taking the time to understand how the compiler of their favorite language works.  It
      gives a deeper perspective on how your tools work.
- name: Doink
  text: Hi Paul Orland do you plan to have a separate book on the lines of Maths for
    Data Scientists? Slightly more deeper and covering topics on numerical optimization,infinite
    series etc but not in the typical classical math textbook format.
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: I don't, but I am trying to convince one of my friends to write such a book!  One
      of the challenges is including enough relevant example to make the book interesting.  Will
      keep you posted!
- name: Alexey Grigorev
  text: 'Hi Paul!

    Which learning plan would you recommend for software engineers who want to get
    into machine learning? What kind of math do they need to focus on - to make the
    learning most effective? And would your book be enough to cover the math fundamentals?'
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: "Alexey Grigorev good question! I think Math for Programmers has a lot of\
      \ math necessary for ML -- namely linear algebra and multivariable calculus. \
      \ The main topic not included in my book which is necessary for ML is probability.\
      \  I suggest buying my book (obviously \U0001F607 ) and taking Andrew Ng's free\
      \ coursera course on ML .  If you work thorough the exercises in my book and this\
      \ ML course, you should be prepped to do a deeper dive in any area of ML you want"
  - name: Alexey Grigorev
    text: 'Thanks! Andrew Ng''s course is awesome!

      In your opinion, how a programmer should approach learning probability and stats?
      You mentioned you might write a sequel for your current book - I guess you already
      thought about this question'
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: I would say, try to learn whatever you want to do in ML or elsewhere, and
      read about anything unfamiliar.  A lot of what I wrote about in Math for Programmers
      is stuff I learned for some application (e.g. Physics). having a goal/application
      in mind is a great way to motivate yourself to learn something, and focus on
      the most important topics.
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: I wish I had a good enough 50,000ft view of probability to give more specific
      advice. This is part of why I'd like to research and put together a book on
      it.
  - name: Alexey Grigorev
    text: Makes sense, thank you!
- name: Vladimir Finkelshtein
  text: "What\u2019s your favorite example, that shows importance of understanding\
    \ math behind ML? Most of the examples I can think of don\u2019t really justify\
    \ a deep dive\u2026"
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: I am kind of a novice, but I think gradient descent is very important!
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: It is good to think of learning as an optimization problem, and gradient
      descent is one optimization algorithm you can use pretty widely
  - name: Vladimir Finkelshtein
    text: "I agree that it is important to learn what an optimization problem is and\
      \ to frame machine learning as one. But it seems like the focus of machine learning\
      \ is on what to optimize, rather than how.\nTo me gradient descend feels kind\
      \ of \u201Cacademic\u201D. I imagine that not many ever write their own optimizer\
      \ for machine learning. Probably for most people reading two nontechnical paragraphs\
      \ explaining the intuition behind gradient descent will be more than enough."
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: Yeah, I guess it's a matter of opinion.  I think deriving the backpropagation
      formulas for a MLP (using gradient descent) and implementing them is a worthwhile
      exercise, because it demystifies machine learning.  I totally agree that ML
      in practice is more about deciding what to optimize.
- name: Doink
  text: Paul Orland How is this book different from Think Stats?
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: "I don't know that book, but presumably the difference is that it covers\
      \ stats while my book does not \U0001F642"
- name: Ben Wilson
  text: Paul Orland I have absolutely and thoroughly enjoyed reading your book. Not
    only are the progressions throughout the examples highly engaging and approachable
    to a wide audience, but the accompanying explanations are very clever and entertaining.
    I'm curious to know if you're planning on ever applying your teaching style and
    examples to the world of geospatial processing (2D and 3D) algorithms? I think
    you'd do a rather great job at making a topic such as that approachable to the
    rapidly growing community of practitioners that are entering that specific space.
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: Glad you liked it!  I don't know much about geospatial algorithms, but sounds
      like it could be a cool application for 2D and 3D geometry.  Can you recommend
      any good references for me to get started?

    text: Ben Wilson do you mean projection algorithms? or stuff like spatial indexes,
      spatial search and so on?

    text: "great circles intersection, polygonal collision, distance measurements\

  - name: Wendy Mak
    text: nice :)) I used to do a lot of spatial stuff (postgis mainly but also a
      bit of python). Would be nice to have a deeper dive into some of the maths definitely

  text: 'I know great developers who want to get into machine learning, but they are
    scared of math. The moment they see a formula, their mind goes blank.

    What would you recommend them to do? How can they overcome this fear?'
  replies:
  - name: Alexey Grigorev
    text: I think the fear comes from school/university when teachers just force math
      down our throat without really explaining why we should learn it
  - name: Roman G
    text: this may help to manage fear
  - name: Evren Unal
    text: Alexey Grigorev   same problem goes for me
  - name: Roman G
    text: It was the same for me, but if you take your time to break a complicated
      formula to parts and dig into each of them, then after a couple of iterations
      it won't be that scary
  - name: Evren Unal
    text: I usually learn difficult topics by finding good explanations

    text: This one? [https://xkcd.com/323/](https://xkcd.com/323/)
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: I like this question because it is a problem I still have -- sometimes I
      find myself looking at a page in a math textbook and thinking to myself this
      looks hopelessly complex.
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: Alexey Grigorev yes exactly!
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: I would say, start by writing down the formulas you do know or drawing diagrams
      (related to the topic), without looking at a book or other resources.  That
      should show you where the holes in your understanding are.  Then go back to
      the book and try to fill these holes as needed.  Over time, you should get some
      more confidence!

    even if they don't need it at work?
  replies:
  - name: Ennio M.A.
    text: I would say yes, I believe that algorithms are basically about breaking
      mathematical constructs into simple step by step processes or approximations,
      at school too much emphasis is given to paper math, I think more emphasis should
      be put into computational thinking in all engineering degrees not only computer
      science.
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: 'A lot of ideas transfer directly from math to computer programming: logic,
      functions, sets, etc.  I''m a strong believer that math skills help you think
      more rigorously about software (of any kind) that you build'
- name: Alexey Grigorev
  text: Also I'm curious what you think about the way math is taught at schools and
    universities. Is there something you'd change?
  replies:
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: Yes, I would change some things!  I think math classrooms should be flipped,
      meaning record lectures so students can consume the content at their own pace,
      independently. Then save class time for exploration and problem solving.  I
      would also say that most people who take math in college are not going to become
      mathematicians, so there should be a greater emphasis on applied math and using
      technology to solve math problems (e.g. Python or even Excel)
  - name: Alexey Grigorev
    text: Nice! How would you motivate students to watch the content at their own
      pace before the classes?
  - name: Alexey Grigorev
    text: That's a problem I also have when teaching adults =)
  - name: Paul Orland
    text: Obviously some students are more self-motivated than others, but I think
      this would increase the quality of the learning experience and have most people
      more engaged overall.
  - name: Alexey Grigorev
    text: Yes, makes sense! Thank you!
