  text: Hayden Liu If you're still new to ML and DL (like myself),  Is it better to
    know TensorFlow and Pytorch or to focus on just one? And which one would you say
    is easier to implement?
  replies:
  - name: Hayden Liu
    text: Glad you ask Ramsi. There is no definite answer to this. However, for ML
      or DL beginners, PyTorch has an easier learning curve as it is more Pythonic
      and debug-friendly and more straightforward when it comes to handling data.
      On the other hand, TensorFlow could indicate a steeper learning curve because
      of the low-level implementations of the neural network structure. Although TensorFlow
      has the high-level Keras API, which makes it easy to get started learning the
      basic concepts, PyTorch has a good trade-off between being easy to use and being
      more easily customizable than Keras.

    text: 'Thanks Hayden Liu! I had started with Pytorch some months back, did a couple
      of projects and moved onto TensorFlow (my internship projects were all in TensorFlow),
      I''ve been thinking if I need to go back and improve my skills in Pytorch ,
      glad to hear that juggling both early on is not a requirement!

      Thanks again :)'

  text: Hayden Liu thanks for presenting your book! When it comes to ML, for me at
    least, the more practical the book the better. Most of the people I know started
    with "Hands on Machine Learning ..." from A.Geron which is also very practical.
    Could you compare your book to this one? Maybe some pros/cons or why people should
    read one or the other? Or both?

  text: 'Hi Hayden Liu. Given the practical focus of your book, and as someone with
    very little theoretical knowledge of ML, would you recommend complementing this
    book with a more theoretical intro book? I suppose I''m worried about falling
    into the trap of knowing how to implement certain ML algorithms and not the ''why''
    behind it all.

    I think it''s a tricky equation balancing the need to ''get your hands dirty''
    and move quickly, with also having solid fundamental (mathematical?) knowledge
    to underpin it. I was interested in hearing your thoughts on this as I''m someone
    with plenty of Python engineering experience but very new to ML. Thank you :)'

    text: Hi James. Thanks for your question. A lot of readers wonder the same. You
      can dive into the book with little theoretical knowledge of ml. As each chapter
      of the book explains the mechanism ML theory and models at the beginning, with
      the help of examples and codes (instead of pure math), followed by implementations
      (from scratch and/or with ML packages) and applications. As long as you know
      Python, and follow the recommended reading list (basic stats and probability)
      in chapter 1, you are good to go.

  text: Hello Hayden Liu, thanks for being here. You are presenting industry-adopted
    examples in your book. Do you also talk about how these models are deployed/served
    and used by clients?
  replies:
  - name: Hayden Liu
    text: 'Thanks Philip for the question. There are sections on setting up / running
      model training and inferencing in GPU, data processing, model training/inferencing
      on Spark.

      Are you referring to serving in API (such as Flask, REST)? Due to the page limit,
      we decided to keep the book focused on ml thoery and implementations, and applications.
      But I think you could find tons of one-pager resources online, and super easy
      to follow'

  text: Hello Hayden Liu, thanks for coming to answer our questions about your book.
    Is there an order for the project examples on your book that you recommend for
    a ML beginner?
  replies:
  - name: Hayden Liu
    text: Hey. thanks for asking. It's a great question btw. You can simply follow
      the chapters. as they are in the order of difficulty and complexity.

  text: Hi Hayden Liu , thanks for taking the time to answer questions here! Sounds
    like a great book. Does it also touch on issues related to deploying models in
    production?

      it is rare that an ML book covers it, as it is really stack specific, environment
      specific. But I think you could find tons of one-pager resources online, and
      super easy to follow.'

Python Machine Learning By Example, Third Edition serves as a comprehensive gateway into the world of machine learning (ML).

With six new chapters, on topics including movie recommendation engine development with Na√Øve Bayes, recognizing faces with support vector machine, predicting stock prices with artificial neural networks, categorizing images of clothing with convolutional neural networks, predicting with sequences using recurring neural networks, and leveraging reinforcement learning for making decisions, the book has been considerably updated for the latest enterprise requirements.

At the same time, this book provides actionable insights on the key fundamentals of ML with Python programming. Hayden applies his expertise to demonstrate implementations of algorithms in Python, both from scratch and with libraries.

Each chapter walks through an industry-adopted application. With the help of realistic examples, you will gain an understanding of the mechanics of ML techniques in areas such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, classification, regression, clustering, and NLP.

By the end of this ML Python book, you will have gained a broad picture of the ML ecosystem and will be well-versed in the best practices of applying ML techniques to solve problems.
