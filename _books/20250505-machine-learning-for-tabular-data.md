title: Machine Learning for Tabular Data
---

Business runs on tabular data in databases, spreadsheets, and logs. Crunch that data using deep learning, gradient boosting, and other machine learning techniques.

Machine Learning for Tabular Data teaches you to train insightful machine learning models on common tabular business data sources such as spreadsheets, databases, and logs. Youâ€™ll discover how to use XGBoost and LightGBM on tabular data, optimize deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch for tabular data, and use cloud tools like Vertex AI to create an automated MLOps pipeline.
