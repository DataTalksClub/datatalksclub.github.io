Combining the demand for AI with the ubiquity of JavaScript was inevitable. With Google's TensorFlow.js
framework, seasoned AI veterans and web developers alike can help propel the future of AI-driven websites.
In this guide, author Gant Laborde--Google Developer Expert in machine learning and the web--provides a
hands-on, end-to-end approach to TensorFlow.js fundamentals for a broad technical audience that includes
data scientists, engineers, web developers, students, and researchers.

You'll begin by working through some basic examples in TensorFlow.js before diving deeper into neural
network architectures, DataFrames, TensorFlow Hub, model conversion, transfer learning, and more. Once
you finish this book, you'll know how to build and deploy production-ready deep learning systems with
TensorFlow.js.
