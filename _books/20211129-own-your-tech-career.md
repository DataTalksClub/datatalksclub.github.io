    \ \nAs a data scientist we understand that our models and predictions will never\
    \ be 100% bcoz we always deal with sample of data and not whole data (aka population\
    \ in statistics) \nWhen speaking to stakeholders or customer who understands only\
    \ business (basically doesn't understand these concepts) how will suggest to approach\
    \ so that we could negotiate in terms of margin of error. \nSay we ask for 20%\
    \ margin of error but stakeholders or customers asks for 5% and now we want to\
    \ bargain on this as we know 5% will be very difficult due to constraints present\
    \ in that situation."

      \ Don't feel obligated to say yes if you can't truly says yes - but remember\

      \ context. That is, they might understand \u201Conly business,\u201D but that\u2019\
      s a really important perspective. Make sure you don\u2019t understand \u201C\
      only tech\u201D\u2014that is, make sure you\u2019ve taken the time to understand\
      \ the business as well, so that you can help translate for them."

    text: "As a business leader, I\u2019ll use your example to perhaps point out the\
      \ difference. For me, someone coming to me with a 20% margin of error is basically\
      \ coming to me with nothing. Emotionally, I feel I could throw darts at a board\
      \ and get 20%; 20% margin of error is a 20% that the data is completely wrong\
      \ and I\u2019ll make entirely the wrong decision.\nThat\u2019s where it can\
      \ help for you to better understand the business side. \u201CSure, I can only\
      \ get you +/- 20% on this data\u2026 but help me understand what your\u2019\
      e trying to prove or disprove. Maybe we can add some other data sets, and between\
      \ their intersections, we can narrow this down for you.\u201D They\u2019re asking\
      \ for 5% because they\u2019d like some confidence in the data; when you offer\
      \ 20%, you\u2019re basically telling them to not be confident in the data. That\
      \ doesn\u2019t help drive a business decision - so what _would_ help drive a\
      \ more valid business decision? Focus less on the data and more on the business\
      \ outcomes being sought, and then look to how you can help support (or not)\
      \ various aspects of that business decision. And if you just can\u2019t\u2026\
      \ it\u2019s fine to say so. \u201CWe don\u2019t have the data to support this\
      \ with any level of confidence one way or another. You\u2019re going to have\
      \ to go with your gut.\u201D Sometimes, business leaders just need to rely on\
      \ their experience instead of data they don\u2019t have."

      \ knowledge. \nI can totally relate myself with context part you explained,\
      \ as that's what I have been doing but didn't know how to apply in tech world.\
      \ As it's totally new field for me. \nAbout the example discussed - 20%. If\
      \ I understood correctly: \n- Keep a range in mind rather than a point.\n- Don't\
      \ disclose your margin before they do. Ask about how are they confident about\
      \ the data. \n- If you n team with little exploration that margin cannot be\
      \ met. Negotiate by asking more data then in terms of margin ?\n- Focus more\
      \ on understanding stakeholder thoughts i.e. in terms of business, rather than\
      \ restricting yourself to only data. \n- Finally if we can't figure out a way\
      \ to achieve the results with the margins specified. Let them know.\nPlease\
      \ correct me if I am wrong.\nMain motive to learn about this part was to be\
      \ able to communicate with people with only business understanding and get information\
      \ from them in terms of tech requirements. \nSo, thank you for clarifying this\

      30min meeting to learn what they do, and what their teams do. It's a great ice

      \ it seems to be reality. \nI'd suggest seeking out allies. I've tried to introduce\

      you can articulate a business-focused, data-driven argument, I'd hope they would
      listen. But focus on business outcomes, investment cost, ROI, and business factors.
      But just because you're interested isn't a valid business factor. If you want
      to pursue something new, why does it have to be at work? What kind of community
      projects could you start or contribute to instead?

  text: 'Hi Don Jones : I bill myself as a generalist, and have been warned this is
    a hurdle for my career development (at a big company) unless I want to be a manager.
    Do you have thoughts on the generalist/expert divide? Is it really as binary as
    specialist or "manager"?'
  replies:
  - name: Don Jones
    text: It kinda is in all but small companies. There's just a feeling that a generalist
      won't be able to do as good of a job, and the fact that big companies like to
      know the whole shape of a person and how they fit into a specific role. It isn't
      always morally right, but it's how the world works. Consider working for smaller
      companies or startups, who tend to put more value on a few clever generalists
      in their ranks.

      \ was maybe 12 people. Small! They were delighted to have me as a generalist.\
      \ I did programming, ran an AS/400, ran the phone system - a lot. They didn\u2019\
      t need a lot of generalists, but having one or two was a great fit.\nAnother\
      \ was huge - maybe 1k people. Big! They had very rigid job descriptions, and\
      \ they needed people to stay in their lane so as to avoid disrupting others.\n\
      It\u2019s very much about the company.\nI also find that generalists have a\
      \ lot of difficulty describing their business value. \u201CI can do it all!\u201D\
      \ Is not terribly convincing or believable; it sounds like bragging. How could\
      \ we put you on a project for six months and then move you? It\u2019s why startups\
      \ are often more open to generalists\u2014especially if you\u2019re good at\
      \ standing up new teams and then making them autonomous and then stepping away.\
      \ That takes generalists, but few articulate it in the sense of \u201Cwhat kinds\
      \ of business outcomes does this create.\u201D And even that\u2019s more a management\
      \ example, I guess.\nActually GOOD generalists aren\u2019t that common, so companies\
      \ don\u2019t create positions for them, and so companies don\u2019t want to\
      \ hire them. I\u2019m actually a VERY effective generalist\u2026 but I can use\
      \ that to specialize into whatever field I need at the time. And that\u2019\

  text: Hi Don Jones thanks for the Q&amp;A! I've found that making time to intentionally
    improve soft skills seems to be more difficult than for more technical skills,
    and I think it's because "Improve my presentation skills" has a less definite
    outcome than "Learn X tool". Do you have suggestions for how to frame the goal

      That being said, I see two noteworthy drawbacks: (1) compared to TF/Keras or
      vanilla PyTorch, there are not as many examples of fastai being deployed in
      production, (2) regressions. Compared to Keras, it is easier to hit regressions
      with the fastai platform (that is, something that used to work that stops working
      after a platform update), and you need to be prepared to work around regressions
      if you come across them in fastai. An example of a regression in fastai is the
      code to set the random seed, which stopped working as expected after an update.
      In addition to these drawbacks, the documentation for fastai is not as comprehensive
      as Keras documentation, but the fastai course forum [https://forums.fast.ai/](https://forums.fast.ai/)
      helps to make up for that.'
