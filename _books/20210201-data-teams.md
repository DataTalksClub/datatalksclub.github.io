Are you starting a data team and don’t know where to start? Are your data teams working but not
producing, and you don’t know why? I’ve written this book to share my extensive experience helping
companies create value with data.

Data Teams goes in-depth on the unified model for creating successful data teams. Being successful
includes ensuring you have the three fundamental teams: data science, data engineering, and operations.
Without all three teams, the data teams won’t achieve their highest and best output. For some
organizations, the team model is there but isn’t working. Data Teams helps you diagnose the problems
so you get the right teams in the right places.
