The book begins by summarizing the value of fastai and showing you how to create a simple
'hello world' deep learning application with fastai. You'll then learn how to use fastai
for all four application areas that the framework explicitly supports: tabular data, text
data (NLP), recommender systems, and vision data. As you advance, you'll work through
a series of practical examples that illustrate how to create real-world applications of
each type. Next, you'll learn how to deploy fastai models, including creating a simple
web application that predicts what object is depicted in an image. The book wraps up with
an overview of the advanced features of fastai.
