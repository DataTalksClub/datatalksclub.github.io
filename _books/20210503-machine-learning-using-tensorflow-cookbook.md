The independent recipes in Machine Learning Using TensorFlow Cookbook will teach you how to
perform complex data computations and gain valuable insights into your data. You will work
through recipes on training models, model evaluation, sentiment analysis, regression analysis,
artificial neural networks, and deep learning - each using Google’s machine learning library, TensorFlow.

This cookbook begins by introducing you to the fundamentals of the TensorFlow library,
including variables, matrices, and various data sources. You’ll then take a deep dive into
some real-world implementations of Keras and TensorFlow and learn how to use estimators to
train linear models and boosted trees, both for classification and for regression to provide
a baseline for tabular data problems.
