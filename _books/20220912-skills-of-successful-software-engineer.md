  text: Hi Fernando Doglio, thanks a lot for doing this!  Just wondering first of
    all how much you address effective communication within teams, and between tech
    and business?
  replies:
  - name: Fernando Doglio
    text: "hey. Ricky, great question! I think I mention the importance of communication\
      \ throughout the book, but I really  make a point of it by the end, chapters\
      \ 7 and 8.  During chapter 7 I cover the importance of communication with your\
      \ team and your manager in multiple places. As for the \u201Cbusiness\u201D\
      , I do cover the subject of talking with clients from a consultant point of\
      \ view. I do not cover the importance of effective communication with the business\
      \ inside the company, if that\u2019s what you were asking for."

  text: "Hi Fernando, congrats on the book. It looks perfect for me and I think I\
    \ will buy it so count me out of the free copy! \U0001F642 I have read Clean Code\
    \ and am currently reading Code Complete. I chose these as I wanted to know wanted\
    \ to approach software in the same way as others and given they're foundational\
    \ texts they seemed a good place to start. Does your book build on/update the\
    \ best practices in these books or have best practices evolved a lot since they\
    \ were written? Also, any criticism of these books and approaches I'd be interested\
    \ to hear. I think older texts can be quite gate-keepy in their own way and project\
    \ a very 'there is only one right way' kind of vibe.\nAlso, do you touch on how\
    \ to get started on contributing to open source? That is something I think a lot\
    \ of people (me included) feel intimidated about, especially if you're not professionally\
    \ part of a software engineering team."

    text: "Hi James, thanks for the question! I honestly can critique those books\
      \ since I haven\u2019t read them. While I do have some chapters that cover coding\
      \ and best practices, the focus of my book is not \u201Cjust that\u201D. So\
      \ I do go into some details about best practices in general, and in regards\
      \ to unit testing, but then I keep going into other topics."
  - name: Fernando Doglio
    text: And as for your question of whether or not best practices evolve over time,
      I tend to agree there. Different architectural patterns either created, or re-discovered
      over time, and that brings light into different ways of tackling the same problems.

  text: "Hi Fernando Doglio , Thank you for giving us this opportunity to discuss\
    \ this topic cuz i realize most people focus only on coding part and ignore other\
    \ skills. \n1 - Do you consider your book a technical book, non-technical or both?\
    \ \n2 - What are the few skills that you gathered much later tahn necessary? \n\
    3 - software engineering is more than memorizing algorithms, it's about being\
    \ able to work well with your team and be able to communicate your solutions well.\
    \ \nHow do you see this saying, and is this what your book is about? \n4 - If\
    \ i hone skills/practices mentioned in your book, would i bridge the gap between\
    \ being decent SWE to a good/great one? \nFinally, wish you best of luck for your\
    \ book, and thanks for your time."

    text: "Hey Di_hash! Great questions!\n1. It\u2019s actually both, I do cover some\
      \ tech points, but most of them are not technical, the focus is the overall\
      \ journey of a developer.\n2. The main one would be communication. I neglected\
      \ it thinking I should only focus on my tech skills. Eventually I realized that\
      \ without being a good communicator, I would not be able to grow in my career.\
      \ \n3. Yeah, I\u2019d say that this is one of the core principles at the center\
      \ of my book.\n4. Well, I certainly hope so! \U0001F642 Of course, it\u2019\
      s all up to you, reading the book alone will not make you better, you have to\
      \ interiorize the teaching, and apply the lessons. It will definitely help you\
      \ jump a few years ahead of everyone else at you same level, that\u2019s for\
      \ sure."

    \ your book. \nMy question is about \u2018gatekeeping\u2019 in tech. How to navigate\
    \ through that? If a person who started late in tech and doesn't have many years\
    \ of experience, but they can do the work, how would they survive?"
  replies:
  - name: Fernando Doglio
    text: "Hey Saba, that\u2019s a tough one. Mainly because the way I deal with \u201C\
      gatekeeping\u201D is by ignoring it, but I understand not everyone can do it.\
      \ My advice would be to keep reaching out to people until you find a positive\
      \ support group. Internet is filled with developers looking to help others,\
      \ some even specialize and create a lot of content and have a lot of advice\
      \ for people switching careers into tech, if you run into gatekeepers, just\
      \ turn around and keep looking."

    text: "And if you don\u2019t know where to look for these people, I would suggest\
      \ reaching out to content creators that produce content around your areas of\
      \ interest and asking for supportive communities, they\u2019re probably exposed\
      \ to multiple ones."

  text: "Hi Fernando Doglio, thank you in advance for answer our questions \U0001F642\
    \nIt seems to me that software development is getting further away from low-level\
    \ programming to a high-level. Before, knowing how hardware and Operating Systems\
    \ work was a must for a great programmer. Today it seems to be all about frameworks\
    \ and how to connect them. All complexity is being hidden and forgotten (it may\
    \ be good or bad:man-shrugging:). I know my statement is very opinionated, but\
    \ it gives the context to my questions:\n1. How do you see the future of software\
    \ development?\n2. What is your advice to someone pursuing a career in software\
    \ development to be focused, and at the same time,  be relevant in the market\
    \ when a new and exciting framework is in demand every day!?"

      \ us to keep moving up on the abstraction layers, like you put it.\n2. As for\
      \ staying up-to-date with all the frameworks out there. that\u2019s impossible,\
      \ and I don\u2019t think it should be anyone\u2019s aim. Instead, you should\
      \ aim to master the basics. No matter what your industry or area of expertise\
      \ is, you should aim to understand the core of programming, and then you\u2019\
      ll see that picking up new frameworks becomes second nature. Focus on understanding\
      \ how different paradigms work, learn about data structures and algorithms\u2026\
      \ learn about architectural patterns. The language is irrelevant and the framework\
      \ even more. Once you know what MVC is (for example), you\u2019ll start seeing\

  text: Hi Luca Massaron Konrad Banachewicz, thanks for being here! My question is,
    how to get started with Kaggle? Is it something like Leetcode where there's a
    problem statement and we start coding? As a beginner, do we just dive into ongoing
    competitions or practice a bit with older competitions? I am really wondering
    on how to get started with Kaggle, want to test my knowledge of basic concepts,
    and learn new things by reading others's code, but don't know how to get started.

  text: Hi Fernando Doglio  thank you for writing this book, I have one question,
    how to avoid getting burned out with the myriad of things to learn especially
    in ML where the rate of newer ideas are a lot. How to get optimal work-life balance?
  replies:
  - name: Fernando Doglio

      \ in your life other than your work to be happy, and that it\u2019s OK to not\
      \ know everything.\nAt the rate at which new technologies are developed, it\u2019\
      s impossible for a person to know everything and to have experience with everything,\
      \ so you have to be able to draw that limit and say \u201Chere, I\u2019m good\

  text: Hi Fernando Doglio thanks for presenting your book. I am currently (re-)reading
    "The pragmatic programmer" which presents a similar "holistic" approach to writing
    software (albeit it seems to be a bit more focussed on technical patterns) and
    I enjoy it very much. What was your personal motivation for writing this book?
    Sections like "getting around gatekeeping in the tech community" sound as if you
    had to overcome very unproductive situations on your way? Do you  "only" present
    personal strategies to navigate these problems or do you have ideas on what has
    to change in the whole community/profession?
  replies:
  - name: Fernando Doglio
    text: "Hey Moritz, thanks for the question. I guess we could say 90% of the book\
      \ is based on personal experience but there are other areas where I just present\
      \ my ideas on how it could be improved. Problems like gatekeeping are very visible\
      \ if you\u2019re active on any social network where many developers interact\
      \ with each other, you can see so many people trying to help others and some\
      \ developers trying to prevent them from moving forward by imposing their own\
      \ ideas of whats \u201Cright\u201D or \u201Cwrong\u201D."
  - name: Fernando Doglio
    text: In the case of gatekeeping, I tried to show what I think are the best ways
      to move around it and most importantly, to be aware of it, because sadly internet
      is not filled with developers helping developers.

  text: Hi Fernando Doglio, thanks for doing this session. I am currently in a team
    where the lead comes from a non-technical background and all members are DSs/SWEs.
    Would you recommend your book to a person less familiar with software development
    that wants to understand how to manage such processes? I am curious if you have
    any tips and experiences on how to bridge the gap between technical team members
    and non-technical leads/ decision makers.
  replies:
  - name: Fernando Doglio
    text: "Hey Hyoson, thanks for the question. I wouldn\u2019t recommend my book\
      \ to this person. I didn\u2019t write it with that kind of profile in mind,\
      \ and if they\u2019re already leading teams with no intention on becoming a\
      \ developer, then the book really wouldn\u2019t do them any good.\nThat said,\
      \ bridging the gap between a non-technical lead and team members is hard, because\
      \ sometimes it might seem like they speak completely different languages. The\
      \ lead will usually have concerns about timeline, product delivery, reaching\
      \ milestones, and if they\u2019re not technical they will have to trust their\
      \ team when it comes to tech issues (like generating/spending time fixing tech\
      \ debt, time estimations, bug reports and many other areas). This person will\
      \ have to actively look for advice from the team, or at least, from the senior\
      \ members of the team.\nFrom the PoV of the team members, they\u2019ll also\
      \ have to try and find a way to have an open dialog and accept that this person\u2019\
      s experience leading teams, even though they lack tech skills, might help them\
      \ be an effective leader regardless. Sometimes tech folk tend to not show the\
      \ same level of considerations or respect to non-tech leaders than what they\
      \ would show to a senior technical person who becomes a leader. That has to\
      \ change, if this person is leading the team, they deserve the benefit of the\
      \ doubt."

    - Do you have any advice concerning how to handle configurational data and transactional
    data that several teams have to use? For example, a data science team and a software
    development team? How should the interface between the teams be designed?

    - What are the most important skills for a tech leader?

    - As a tech leader, how can you ensure high quality in your production code and
    at the same time provide meaningful tasks for junior developers in your team?

    - How did you improve your communication skills?'

    text: "great questions!\nLet me start in reverse order:\n4. Writing did the trick\
      \ for me. I started writing articles online, and that helped with my english\
      \ and my ability to explain complicated concepts in simple ways.\n3. I\u2019\
      m not sure I understand this one, if by \u201Chigh quality in your production\
      \ code\u201D you mean MY actual code, I can\u2019t, but that\u2019s because\
      \ as a tech lead I don\u2019t code. It\u2019s been my experience that as a tech\
      \ lead I\u2019m too busy with others managing tasks (estimations, client management,\
      \ team management, etc) to be able to have enough time to code myself. Considering\
      \ all the tasks I have at hand, it would be irresponsible to put coding tasks\
      \ on my backlog as well, I wouldn\u2019t be able to deliver them on time.\n\
      2. I would say they\u2019re not technical. Communication and empathy are two\
      \ big ones on my book. Tech people tend to be really bad at those, some of them\
      \ like machines more than people, so they don\u2019t focus on developing their\
      \ communication skills, specially early on. Being able to interact with them\
      \ in a way they feel heard, and then turn around and talk to the business in\
      \ a way they understand what\u2019s happening is a key skill any lead should\
      \ have.\n1. I\u2019m not sure I understand this question either, can you elaborate\

    text: "Fernando Doglio thank you for your answers. Seems like I wasn't very precise\
      \ in writing down my questions \U0001F609\n- Concerning question 3, yes, probably\
      \ the lead does not code anymore. However, he/she will have to ensure that the\
      \ products are running at all times, that there are no bugs and that the code\
      \ stays maintainable. It seems to be that many junior developers are struggling\
      \ with these objectives. How can you help junior developers grow and get better\
      \ and avoid creating a mess in your products on the way?\n- Concerning question\
      \ 1, as an example, if your organisation has a data science team and a team\
      \ with developers. The data science team creates models which produce predictions\
      \ that should be displayed in a web application with a nice user interface.\
      \ The web application is created by the developers. The data science team provides\
      \ an API for the developers to use. For this purpose, a lot of data has to be\
      \ shared between the teams. For example, how should the predictions be presented?\
      \ Also the model might change over time, the inputs and outputs might have to\
      \ be adjusted from time to time which needs to be communicated between the teams.\

      \ you design the whole setup differently?"
