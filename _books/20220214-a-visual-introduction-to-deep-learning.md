  replies:
  - name: Meor Amer
    text: Hi Ruiz. It's only in PDF right now. Because the book contains mostly visuals,
      it might be tricky to have an EPUB format that can give a good reading experience.
      But TBH I haven't explored it in great detail, will definitely take a closer
      look.

  replies:
  - name: Meor Amer
    text: Hi Tino. It's my pleasure! Unfortunately, the book doesn't cover Explainable
      AI. Where this book can contribute is by helping readers build a clear framework
      of understanding before diving deeper into further deep learning topics like
      Explainable AI.

  replies:
  - name: Meor Amer
    text: Hi Gur, thanks for checking out my posts and for your kind words! Indeed,
      there are already a number of amazing illustrated DL books from top authors.
      Where I try to add value is making a book that helps the reader navigate the
      various concepts with the least friction. For example, the same dataset is used
      in all chapters so you have the same, consistent reference. And the math is
      kept to an absolute minimum because the main goal is to help the reader build
      a strong intuition first.

  replies:
  - name: Meor Amer
    text: Hi Dustin. Yes, that's what got me interested in this field. It's been quite
      some time and the progress was much slower then. But now it's really exciting
      with the emergence of companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink. The use case possibilities
      are huge, stroke rehabilitation and amputee assistance being a couple of examples.
      Though we are still some way from practical and affordable solutions, it has
      definitely being given a boost in recent years.

  text: Hi Meor Amer, what gave you inspiration to visualize deep learning concepts
    in the way you did in your book? Was it challenging to make those visualizations?
    What tools did you use?
  replies:
  - name: Meor Amer
    text: Hi Benedict. My inspiration is the amazing designer Jack Butcher (Visualize
      Value). Ironically, what he'd taught me is you don't have to be good at designing
      (that's me!) to be able to come up with impactful visuals. It's more about sharing
      your perspectives than worrying about the aesthetics. It is still challenging,
      but through practice, it gets easier. As for the tool, I use Figma - highly
      recommended!

  text: 'Hi Meor Amer, really impressive to me and looking forward to your more outstanding
    books! Here are my questions:

    1. Beginners like me can easily understand it after reading with the visual intuition,
    however, after some days, some of the fundamentals may get vague in my mind, can
    we have some practice tips to consolidate the concept for readers?

    2. Do you plan to simplify the mathematic algorithms and other complicated stuff
    like that in ML/DL by the way of visualization in the book?

    3. What''s your next plan on the book, expanding the other knowledge domain related
    to ML/DL or go deeper of each part within ML/DL knowledge?

    4. Do you have plan to spread this type or series of books to more areas, like
    country as China where has big potential and a huge number of readers who have
    great interests on ML/DL knowledge?

    5. Can anyone get the fortune to get full copy If he can translate it into Chinese
    edition and try to boost its local publication? :)'

      code used to run the examples in the book. And yes, further down the line I
      do have ideas for creating additional hands-on exercises.

      2. Yes, that''s my intention with the book - to help readers build an intuition
      first (by way of visuals) using the minimum possible math and equations.

      3. The next one I''m planning is A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning.

      4. Absolutely, I''m always open to potential collaborations to help make deep
      learning accessible for more!

      5. That''s an interesting prospect. Would love to explore this!'

  text: How do you come up with visualization ideas?
  replies:
  - name: Meor Amer
    text: 'Hi Alexey. Here are some that have worked for me:

      - As for any generic ML visuals, it helps to observe for phenomenons/things
      outside of ML/Tech. Because a lot of things around us happen via similar universal
      principles, we can take one concept from one area and apply it to another.'

      tweaks required in the neural network to address four types of tasks: linear
      regression, non-linear regression, binary classification, and multi-class classification.

  text: 'Hey Meor Amer thank you for answering our questions.

    1-How long did it take you to write the book? And which part of it was the most
    time intensive?

    2-Where do you think the future of Deep learning is heading?

    3-Is having knowledge in Machine learning necessary to understand and follow your
    book?

    4-Do you have new visualization books ideas in your mind for future work?

    5-How did your self learn deep learning?'
  replies:
  - name: Meor Amer
    text: 'Hi Ali. You are most welcome.

      1-It took me around 3 months of almost full-time work. The most time-intensive
      is the continuous structuring of what to cover vs. not to cover to ensure that
      the whole flow makes sense.

      2-Less labels and multi-modal i.e. getting closer to how humans learn.

      3-The book is written with the beginner in mind. So the good news is you don''t
      need any background in ML to read it!

      4-Yes, I do. The next I have planned is A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning.
      It will be more challenging to write though because it''s broad whereas deep
      learning is specific.

      5-Initially by working on domains I am familiar/interested in e.g. telecommunications,
      biomedical engineering. Combined that with theory learning like courses, books,
      etc.'

  text: Hi Meor Amer ! Thanks for answering questions about your book. I would like
    to ask your opinion on who would have the most gain from this book? An audience
    with no prior exposure to deep learning, or an audience who is comfortable with
    it, or somewhere in between? I'd appreciate if you could elaborate. Thank you
    in advance!
  replies:
  - name: Meor Amer
    text: Hi Roy. This book is beginner-friendly and so it's fine for those without
      prior exposure to DL. If you are already comfortable with it, then probably
      you won't gain as much new information. But perhaps the visuals can still help
      give different perspectives to what you already know.

  replies:

    text: Hi Meghana, thanks for going through the sample. Yes, that's how I got started.
      It's been some time and I'd say the progress hasn't been as fast as people would
      hope it to be. Viable consumer applications are still not there yet. Having
      said that, I'm excited that companies like Neuralink and Kernel are bringing
      these ideas more into the mainstream, which help to bring more talents into
      this field and accelerate the  progress.

Deep learning can be quite daunting to learn. With the abundance of learning resources in recent years has emerged another problem-information overload.

This book aims to compress this knowledge and make the subject approachable. By the end of this book, you will be able to build a visual intuition about deep learning and neural networks.
