title: A Visual Introduction to Deep Learning
---

Deep learning is the algorithm powering the current renaissance of Artificial Intelligence (AI). And the progress is not showing signs of slowing down. A McKinsey report estimates that by 2030, AI will potentially deliver $13 trillion to the global economy, or 16% of the world's current GDP. This opens up exciting career opportunities in the coming decade.

But deep learning can be quite daunting to learn. With the abundance of learning resources in recent years has emerged another problem-information overload.

This book aims to compress this knowledge and make the subject approachable.

By the end of this book, you will be able to build a visual intuition about deep learning and neural networks.
