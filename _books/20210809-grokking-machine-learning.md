    What makes this book special from other related books on the market?'
  replies:
  - name: Luis Serrano
    text: 'Hi Alper Demirel , thank you for your interest!

      I wrote this book to be understandable by readers without an extensive background
      in math and programming, so the algorithms are explained in a more conceptual
      way with examples, figures, and stories, as opposed to formulas. (The formulas
      are there too, but they appear after the conceptual explanations)'

      \ way I like to understand things. When I started writing this book it wasn\u2019\

      \ it to others it has already been digested in my mind, so teaching comes out\

    text: Hi Kashan Ahmed! Great question, yes, the person who finishes the book will

  replies:

    text: 'Hi xnot!

      I think geometric intuition is more important than the formulas and the math.
      And yes, I think this can be done while learning and developing ML.

      When I talk about geometric intuition, I mean things like drawing lines that
      pass close to a group of points, lines and planes that separate points of different
      colors, rotations, transformations, etc. Most people have this type of intuition,
      it''s only a matter of tying it to the algorithms and the applications.'

    machine learning with only Python?
  replies:
  - name: Luis Serrano
    text: 'Thanks Quynh Le!

      If you learned regression, then you know machine learning. Most of the main
      algorithms are similar to that one, only with some small tweaks. I think a book
      or introductory course in ML can get you up to speed. And yes, one can implement

    text: 'Gracias Alex !

      The book aims to be a one-size-fits-all, as it offers beginners a chance to
      get into ML, and the more experts a different and simpler view of the algorithms
      that perhaps they haven''t seen before.

      But in a nutshell, the reader who''ll enjoy this book the most is the beginner
      in ML who comes without a very heavy knowledge of mathematics and programming.
      The reason is because in the book we explain the methods and algorithms from
      a more intuitive perspective, where the math is there, but more in drawings
      and examples than in formulas.'

      hope you had a chance to check out [the youtube videos](http://www.youtube.com/c/LuisSerrano).

      1. For anomaly detection, such as Fukushima, I would use unsupervised learning
      techniques, such as clustering, etc. Some of them, like DBSCAN, have a way to
      detect outliers.

      2. I add examples of recommendation engines such as youtube in several places
      in the book. For example, you can use linear regression to predict how long
      a video will be watched by a user based on how long that user has watched other
      videos. Also, classification methods can be used similarly to predict if the
      video will get watched or not. Also, there is an example of analyzing the text
      in Netflix reviews of movies, using python.

      3. The book will be released very soon, it''s in the last stage of production.
      I think there''ll be a physical version in about 1-2 months. I have enjoyed

It's time to dispel the myth that machine learning is difficult. Grokking Machine Learning
teaches you how to apply ML to your projects using only standard Python code and high school-level
math. No specialist knowledge is required to tackle the hands-on exercises using readily-available
machine learning tools!
