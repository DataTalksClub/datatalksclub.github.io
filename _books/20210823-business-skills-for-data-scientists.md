    How important are business skills in a data scientist''s career? Aren''t these
    skills considered enough? Do people avoid it or think it''s a waste of time?'

      the introduction at the beginning of the book.

      sample of the book and read the preface, introduction and first chapter or two
      without actually buying the entire book.   This will probably give a better
      answer to your question than I could type in here.

  text: 'Hi David Stephenson, I''ve always considered storytelling to be one of the
    most underrated skills on the software industry. Beyond the effective use of charts,
    which is something every data scientist should master, what other storytelling
    tools do you recommend?

    Also, do your think going as far as to read our take courses on writing (i.e.
    how to write a book or a movie script) may help? Know of any related anecdote?

  replies:
  - name: David Stephenson
    text: Hi Toxicafunk, we need to consider the WHO, the WHAT and the HOW of the
      storytelling process.  Making good charts is just part of the HOW.  In my experience,
      many data scientists fail to understand their audience (WHO) and, surprisingly,
      also don't have a firm grasp of their own message (WHAT).   I talk about these
      in more detail in chapters 2, 6 and 7 of the book.
  - name: Toxicafunk
    text: Great insight David Stephenson I think getting the WHAT right comes from
      experience, but the WHO is always a tricky.
  - name: David Stephenson
    text: Actually, getting the WHAT right is really difficult, even with experience.  Most
      data science presentations don't truly have a clear, focused, relevant WHAT.

      you''ll be able to identify the most important business questions, communicate
      effectively, and work through difficulties and roadblocks together with those
      stakeholders and colleagues.   It''s the focus of chapter 2 in the book, where
      I try to illustrate how various horizontal and vertical segments of the company
      can be completely different.  it''s important for us to understand those differences
      so that we can work effectively.'

  text: "Hi David Stephenson , another industry that takes pride in their business\
    \ knowledge is the consulting industry. The key players in this field have collectively\
    \ converged to the [\u201Ccase study\u201D interview format](https://mconsultingprep.com/case-interview-examples/)\
    \ where the candidate is given a description of a business situation and the issue\
    \ at hand (e.g. company needs to understand why it\u2019s losing money) and is\
    \ asked to apply their knowledge to provide a data-driven advice for the company\

    \ their day-to-day job as well. Do you think practicing such case studies is a\

  - name: David Stephenson
    text: Hi Saulius Lukauskas, when I was finishing grad school,  some classmates
      looked into consulting and went through that Mckinsey/BCG case study interview
      process.  It's interesting, and it fits their business model, but I think it's
      a bit less relevant to data scientists.   It really depends on what skills you
      expect for the role you're hiring for, and whether you are expecting the person
      to identify novel solutions or rather focus on technical progress.  This relates
      to the topic of whether to have a designated 'Analytics Translator'.   More
      relevant in our case, I think, would be case studies focused on identify data
      sources, scoping PoCs, and choosing the proper type of model to start with.  Also,
      giving the applicant a scenario where a project was failing and asking them
      for suggestions as to why they think it failed (I have an exercise like this
      in one of my training modules).

    \ have realized that the step between outlining the business logic and translating\
    \ to development doesn\u2019t get as much time and effort as it needs. For example\
    \ the first run of my product I was both getting requirements from the CTO, interpreting\
    \ things the way I understood it and doing the development work and pushing to\
    \ production. I did not have a QA team, PM, code review team or even an architect\
    \ to cross-check me. My documentation left a lot to be desired as I was always\
    \ putting out fires or getting a product developed to run the company\u2019s business.\
    \ As a result, even with the best of intentions many mistakes were made. While\
    \ this is not typical, I often wonder if I could have mitigated this in any manner\

  replies:
  - name: Rui Ramos
    text: Hi Pavitra, in my perspective the best thing that could be done is an assessment
      of Risk and Impact and share that with your C-Levels. What kind of disruptions
      would it cause if the data doesn't have enough quality, if that finds to be
      a big issue that you can present the prof on your assessment that things could
      go side-ways and don't simply expect for the best. From your description it
      seems to me that you required a team in order to provide a production ready
      product/feature and your C-level should support you on that or grant you the
      required skillets to accomplish alone what they ask.

    text: Hi Pavitra Chakravarty  It's really difficult to be the only data scientist
      in a company that isn't used to working with data scientists.  It's also very
      common.  I've spoken with many people in similar situations.

    text: 'I would say, no, you should not have insisted on first getting a team,  especially
      in a startup, where resources are tight and everyone is expected to be flexible.

      In situations like this, you need to be extremely agile, which, at it''s core,
      means working very closely with your stakeholders and getting input and feedback
      as often as possible.

      They in turn should recognize that mistakes will be made.

      It may be that you''d feel more comfortable in an established team at this point
      in your career.  That''s also a legitimate career choice.'

  text: David Stephenson What is (are) the most challenging business skills for data
    scientist to learn and adopt?
  replies:
  - name: David Stephenson
    text: I think the hardest is learning to understand and relate well with colleagues,
      especially non-technical colleagues. I devote four chapters to this subject.
      We can stay in our technical bubbles all through school, but then suddenly need
      to relate to completely different types of people.  Of course these aren't typically
      the top-of-mind skills, such as storytelling, managing expectations, finding
      the best use cases, etc (ch 6-11), but not relating effectively in certain ways
      can easily shipwreck a data science effort.

  text: David Stephenson Thank you for doing this. My question is bit reverse. Means
    with regard to business people, how I make DS team understand ground realities?
    In my past experiences. mostly DS team want to work on challenging problem, which
    may not have business sense. Hence how a business team help DS to understand it
    better? What common language they should use?
  replies:
  - name: David Stephenson
    text: 'Lalit Pagaria Also a great question, and very relevant.  I know some data
      scientists who simply don''t want to work on business problems b/c they aren''t
      interesting enough!

      I really encourage data scientists to work closely with the business stakeholders--to
      participate in scoping meetings, to present their work in regular demo''s, and
      to maintain regular contact with these business partners  (eg. on Slack or MS
      Teams).  I myself work hard to ensure that the data scientists recognize the
      importance of the business problem and check that their presentations to the
      business have relevant content (and are not too technical).

      In my experience, not enough effort is put into developing the WHY of a project
      (I''ve called it the WHAT of storytelling above).  When this is done right,
      it should provide a good basis to motivate the data scientists.  Oh, and make
      sure you don''t hire people who truly want ONLY technically-interesting work
      and have no interest in delivering business value.'

      I''ve found it more difficult to read people and to forge new relationships

      up on people who don''t respond to emails.

      Cultural differences can also be amplified (I think I give the example of cc''ing
      managers in chapter 3, which is a bigger deal when communication becomes more
      electronic).

    How effective are guesstimates in real world settings ?'
  replies:
  - name: David Stephenson
    text: I wouldn't say there is an entire layer, or even role, that would be eliminated,
      but it would make everyone's lives easier.  Consider the product owner role.
      Can / could data scientists serve as their own product owners?  I would say
      Yes, if they have the appropriate business skills, but that's perhaps not the
      best use of their time.  Regarding middle management, again No, as its function
      is broader than simply providing business skills.

    business about the possibilities of data?
  replies:
  - name: David Stephenson
    text: 'Hi Luis, this is a very common challenge. Fortunately it''s getting somewhat
      easier these days, as traditional companies become eager to not miss the boat
      in this area (and supervisory boards even place pressure on CEOs).

      What I sometimes do as an external consultant is to set up data strategy workshops
      to quick-start projects, but that assumes a certain level of buy-in being there
      already.

      As an internal, I would recommend that you

      1. Identify people in the company who are interested in trying out new solutions.
      Sometimes this is top-down, from executives who latch on to buzz words, and
      sometimes it''s bottom-up, when practitioners are eager to bring in new approaches.

      2. Identify top-of-mind business goals and build a strong case for how data
      &amp; analytics can meet those goals.  This could be in solving a pain point
      or in making a substantial improvement and might generally fall into the business
      goals of increased profit, increased market share, decreased cost, or decreased
      risk.  First you''ll need to understand the currents flowing in your company,
      else you''ll be selling a solution that is swimming upstream.

      I might be able to give you more specific advice if you have a few minutes to
      describe your situation.  If you send me a DM, we can continue from there.'

      and industry literature and livened up a bit with personal anecdotes.

      That being said, the book is definitely targeted at analytic roles, which typically

  replies:
  - name: David Stephenson
    text: 'Ok, this is a bit of a dangerous one to answer!

      First, analysts tend to process quantitative information faster than their colleagues,
      which makes it challenging for them to communicate effectively.

      Second, the mental precision that enables success in the analytics field can
      be detractors in the business realm.  For example, we find it difficult to cope
      with ambiguous situations.

      Third, analytic work by nature involves less social interaction, which is a
      big minus when it comes to understanding your colleagues.  This hits especially
      hard in a business environment, where people in marketing, finance and strategy
      are so very different in their priorities and ways of working (see chapter 2)

      What would help in education is to give students more exposure to experienced
      professionals, ideally including non-analysts but realistically at least analysts
      with strong business experience.'

  text: Hi David Stephenson, I am applying for data analyst position and find your
    book very informative! As a newbie, I have a basic question about how data analysts
    could show understanding about the company when working. I think data analysts'
    responsibilities mainly involve providing the stakeholders with the data evidence
    (such as numbers, charts) of what is happening in the company. How could I show
    more business understanding more than just showing the numbers? What else would
    business stakeholders like data analysts to discuss more?
  replies:
  - name: David Stephenson
    text: 'Hi Quynh Le, it''s really good you''re asking this question.  A common
      complaint from senior managers is when analysts only provide charts and data
      but don''t act as ''thought partners''.

      First, it''s important to understand the ''question behind the question''  When
      someone asks for data or a chart, try to understand the business motivation.

      As you prepare your presentation, try to imagine what follow-up questions your
      audience might have, and prepare for those questions.

      Also, be prepared with recommendations. It''s possible that your audience will
      not ask your opinion (or even want your opinion!), but it''s good if you have
      thought through in advance what you think the best course of action would be,
      based on your analysis.

      In addition to doing this for your own projects, take the initiative to chat
      with colleagues in other teams to hear what their challenges are.  This will
      not only help you identify new applications but will also give you a more wholistic
      view of the company, which will go a long way in helping you propose solutions
      that are most relevant for your company,'
  - name: Quynh Le
    text: David Stephenson thank you for sharing your opinions! I find myself often
      caught up with the analysis and forget about what else next. From your answer,
      I think that an analyst really needs to think deeply about what data could means
      to business strategy and to anticipate what stakeholders really ask more from
      the analysis. I also find your point about chatting with other colleagues really
      helpful. Thanks for your sharing!

    text: 'Hi Kyle Shannon, not specific feedback, but there is a lot of overlap between
      the target audiences.  That is, there are two types of corporate trainings I
      generally give.  The first covers business skills for data scientists. The second
      covers skills for Analytics Translators, who are, roughly speaking, the non-techies
      who work closely with data scientists.  Some of the chapters in the book are
      used in both trainings (specifically, chapters 5-11).   You might check out
      the chart at the bottom of [this page](https://dsianalytics.com/data-science-trainings/)

      What''s different in the Analytics Translator training is that I also talk about
      the basics of Statistics / Machine learning, to help business colleagues put
      everything into perspective and to help them manage some of the pitfalls inherent
      in DS work.

      A third target group would be business executives, for whom I host workshops
      rather than give trainings.  In this case, I focus on the big picture of applied
      analytics, how to bring value to a company, how to choose technologies, hire
      teams, form a roadmap, etc.  That is really more the subject of my previous
      book ("Big Data Demystified, How to ... ")'

      of change management that you''ll have to deal with.  It''s hard for me to speak
      to those nuances, as I have little experience working in the public sector.  What
      the book should still do, however, is to give you the basis for discovering
      the best way of working in your own surroundings.

      If your organization is using a highly structured project management framework,
      such as Prince2, you may have difficulty using some of the techniques I write
      about in chapters 8 and 9 (scoping projects and planning kickoff meetings),
      as well as in ch 11 (agile, kanban, etc,)   If that''s the case, the principles
      in those chapters will still be valuable, but you''d need to adjust how they
      are used.'

  text: 'Hi David Stephenson Thanks for providing us with the chance of asking you
    some questions. I am a spatial data analyst, who recently became the lead of the
    newly formed data analysis team at my company, consisting 20 colleagues. It is
    the first time I am in this position and the main reason was that I "have a talend
    to function as a communitcation bridge between the stakeholders and the team,
    can prioritize and define tasks efficiently, have the necessary skillset and have
    a constant open attitude" (my CTO). While I am flattered with these compliments
    and the opportunity I got I also feel the urge to not leave it like this, but
    to actually learn more about the communication process between data and business
    people. This, together with my current private project of creating a small data-driven
    local firm, is the reason why I would love to know how to approach stakeholders
    for the first time.

    A use-case at my work is that I am often invited to a meeting where some stackholder
    of any kind (C-level, client, developer, PM etc.) talk to me the first time and
    expect things that are just totally out of scope for the given time, asking me
    things that are totally not data-related or think that we are just "some Excel
    guys". I am wondering if there are strategies to actively create some awareness
    in the company / to individuals about what data analysis team actually do. Perhaps
    you have an example that I could use :)

    text: 'Hi Sepp, first, congratulations on the promotion!  Sounds like some great
      feedback.

      I''m seeing several questions in this paragraph. For the first, I have a method
      I typically use in initial scoping meetings.  It takes 1-2 hours to run through,
      but it''s worth it. I describe it in detail in chapter 8, but if you don''t
      have a copy of the book, here is a link to at least show your the canvas for
      it: [http://dsianalytics.com/4](http://dsianalytics.com/4)

      Your second question is a bit more difficult to answer, as it depends on whether
      you already have a place at the strategic table or not.  If not, see chapter
      1 in the book (available in the free kindle sample). If so, it''s more in chapter
      10.

      It''s difficult to really answer this w/o more context. Send me a DM and maybe
      we can set up a short call.'

      two of the book, I walk through examples of how colleagues differ with respect

      mindset.

      A lot of companies are sending people to trainings in something called Design
      Thinking (DT), a customer-focused technique for designing relevant products.
      This might be helpful. I use principles from DT in my strategy workshops, but
      I''ve never attended one of these specific DT trainings.

      Of course I''m biased, but I''d suggest the best way to quick-start this skill
      for data scientists is by reading my book or attending one of
      [my trainings](https://dsianalytics.com/data-science-soft-skills-training/).  I

    text: 'Hi Krzysztof Ograbek,

      I would say that the business skills make data scientists much more valuable.  Without
      them, you''re dependent on your manager or colleagues for communication, prioritization
      and stakeholder management, which really puts a roadblock on your career.

      A few surprises in store:

      - Your non-technical audience probably understands about 5% of your presentations

      - Many of your colleagues have completely different definitions of ''work well
      done''

      - Your network is more important than your knowledge when it comes to advancing
      your career

      In terms of biggest misconception, I would say that it''s very difficult for
      non-techies to understand the effort required and the risk entailed by DS projects.  This
      is why stakeholder management skills are so critical.'

    text: 'Hi Asmita, yes, DEFINITELY build domain knowledge.  Try to use the company''s

      you work on a project with stakeholders, ask them questions about the project
      background, default solutions, how competitors do things differently, etc.  You''ll
      build the domain knowledge while also earning the trust of your stakeholders,
      as they notice that you are listening.  It will also help a lot in designing
      your solutions.

      On that subject, your first ML solutions should be designed in light of current
      (manual) best practices.  They should probably use similar intuition and produce
      comparable results.  I''ve seen analysts deliver complicated models that couldn''t
      compare with manual methods, and they lose credibility quickly this way.'
