If you’re looking to make a career move from programmer to AI specialist, this is the ideal place
to start. Based on Laurence Moroney's extremely successful AI courses, this introductory book provides
a hands-on, code-first approach to help you build confidence while you learn key topics.

You’ll understand how to implement the most common scenarios in machine learning, such as computer
vision, natural language processing (NLP), and sequence modeling for web, mobile, cloud, and embedded
runtimes. Most books on machine learning begin with a daunting amount of advanced math. This guide
is built on practical lessons that let you work directly with the code.
