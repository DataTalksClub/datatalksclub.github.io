Deep learning offers the potential to identify complex patterns and relationships hidden in data of all sorts. Deep Learning with Structured Data shows you how to apply powerful deep learning analysis techniques to the kind of structured, tabular data you'll find in the relational databases that real-world businesses depend on. Filled with practical, relevant applications, this book teaches you how deep learning can augment your existing machine learning and business intelligence systems.
