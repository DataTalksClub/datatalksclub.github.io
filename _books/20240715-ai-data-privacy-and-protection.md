    text: "from Justin Ryan (my co author) \u2014 So, you're starting up a company\
      \ and want to set up a data warehouse or some fancy AI models, right? Cool stuff!\
      \ But here's the deal - you gotta think about what's most important first. \n\
      Look, if I were in your shoes, I'd say security is your top priority. Why? Well,\
      \ imagine someone hacking into your system and stealing all your data or messing\
      \ with your models. That'd be a nightmare! So, make sure you've got solid security\
      \ measures in place. You know, like strong passwords, encryption, and keeping\
      \ an eye out for any suspicious activity.\nNext up is data protection. This\
      \ is all about keeping your data safe and sound, and making sure you're not\
      \ breaking any laws. You don't want to end up with a massive fine because you\
      \ didn't handle people's data properly, right? So, make sure you're backing\
      \ up your data regularly and following all those data protection rules.\nLast\
      \ but not least is governance. Now, this might sound boring, but it's actually\
      \ pretty important. It's all about having a good system in place to manage your\
      \ data and models. Think of it like keeping your room organized - it makes everything\
      \ run smoother and helps you avoid headaches down the line.\nSo yeah, that's\
      \ the order I'd go with: security first, then data protection, and finally governance.\
      \ Get these right, and you'll be setting yourself up for success. Just remember,\
      \ it's not about being perfect from day one. Start with the basics and build\
      \ from there. Does that make sense?\u201D"

  text: Hi Ryan &amp; Mario, We hear a lot about security with GenAI. How do we ensure
    data privacy and protection when consuming open public GenAI services.  is there
    a framework or reference we can use to validate before using them. Thanks
  replies:
  - name: Mario Lazo
    text: 'Thanks for reaching out. Yes, security is a huge concern with Gen AI...  Currently,
      there''s no single framework specifically for validating open public GenAI services,
      we can look at some existing data privacy and security guidelines for reference.
      Here are a few good ones to consider:

      1. [NIST Privacy Framework](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework): This is
      a voluntary tool developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
      to help organizations manage privacy risks while building innovative products
      and services.

      2. [ISO/IEC 27701](https://www.iso.org/standard/71670.html) (Privacy Information
      Management): This is an international standard for privacy information management.

      3. [AICPA''s Privacy Management Framework](https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/informationtechnology/resources/privacy):
      This framework provides guidance on privacy practices and controls.

    \ when using public GenAI services. Avoid sharing sensitive or personal information\
    \ whenever possible.\n2. AI Powered Anonymization and Pseudonymization: Before\
    \ inputting any data, consider anonymizing or pseudonymizing it to remove personally\
    \ identifiable information. \n3. Vendor Assessment: Carefully evaluate the privacy\
    \ practices and security measures of the GenAI service provider. Look for external\
    \ privacy certifications and compliance with regulations like GDPR.\n4. Data Access\
    \ Controls: Implement strict controls on who in your organization can access and\
    \ use these public GenAI services.\n5. Output Monitoring: Have processes in place\
    \ to scan outputs from GenAI services for potential data leaks or sensitive information.\n\
    6. User Training: Educate employees on responsible use of public GenAI tools and\
    \ the risks of sharing sensitive data.\n7. Contractual Safeguards: Ensure service\
    \ agreements include robust data protection clauses, clarifying data ownership\
    \ and deletion policies."

  text: 'I also want to give an excerpt from the book... about AI-Powered Data Anonymization
    Techniques

    Here is an example of AI-powered data anonymization techniques:

    a) Differential Privacy: This technique adds carefully calibrated noise to data
    or analysis results to ensure individual records cannot be identified, while maintaining
    overall statistical accuracy. Apple has used this to gather user insights privately.

    b) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs can generate synthetic datasets
    that preserve the statistical properties of the original data without containing
    actual individual records. This synthetic data can be used for AI training and
    analysis without privacy concerns.

    c)  Automated Feature Engineering: AI models automatically identify and transform
    data features to enhance privacy while preserving analytical value.

    d) Federated Learning: While not strictly anonymization, this technique keeps
    personal data on user devices and only shares model updates, reducing exposure
    of sensitive data.

    e) Data Masking: Replaces original values with artificial but realistic data that
    cannot be reverse engineered.

    f) Data Generalization: Reduces precision of data (e.g. exact age to age range)
    to make it less identifiable.

    g) Data Swapping: Interchanges values of selected records to protect against identification.'

  text: 'Hi Mario, Justin,

    If for some reasons could be regulatory reasons,  if a user''s data must be excluded,
    what steps are typically expected of a company regarding its machine learning
    model that is trained on that data?

    Specifically, should the company only remove the user''s data from its database,
    or is there an expectation to retrain the model without that data, considering
    it was trained on data that can no longer be used?

    Thanks'

      TLDR : Complete erasure of data is nearly impossible due to the nature of ML,
      which can reconstruct data from fragments. I think this is easier said than
      done.'
