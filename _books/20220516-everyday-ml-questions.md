A different way to learn

This book aims to teach you something new, one question at a time.

There are 20,000 + 1 machine learning and data science books out there. That's great, but we wanted something different.

In April, we started publishing one machine learning question every day. A quick story with a problem and a few possible answers. Something quick, practical, and fun that you could solve in a few seconds. In just 30 days the site attracted more than 80,000 visitors and every day over 1,500 people answer the question and it keeps growing.

Many reached out asking for previous questions.

This book is a compendium of the 30 questions we published online from April 1 to April 30, 2022.
