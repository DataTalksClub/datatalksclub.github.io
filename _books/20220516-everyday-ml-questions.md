    How did you come up with the idea of bnomial?
    Which problem did you see with other similar websites and blog posts?'

    text: "Thanks for inviting us!\nI\u2019m always been fascinated by multi-choice\
      \ questions because they are an excellent way to exercise your brain.\nWhen I\u2019\
      m studying something new, I need to find ways to practice. Sometimes building\
      \ projects is the way, but sometimes that\u2019s not an option.\nSo we decided\
      \ to build a site that would help people with their machine learning and data\
      \ science journeys. Not to overwhelm people and make them sit through a long exam,\
      \ but to go at it in different way: a little bit every day.\nBnomial tries really\
      \ hard to do what I want for my life: to build a learning habit."

    text: "Our goal is not to compete with blog posts, tutorials, videos, or books.\
      \ Those are great!\nOur goal is to become a different component of your learning\
      \ journey. One that\u2019s fun, doesn\u2019t take a long time, and will stick\
      \ with you for a long time."

    text: "This is an interesting question.\nHere is where we are headed in the short\
      \ term: *creating a scoring system that encourages people to show up and answer\
      \ more questions*.\nLetting you know where you stand, and helping you track\
      \ your improvements over time is key.\nRight after that, we\u2019ll see where\
      \ we want to take this. We are taking it one step at a time."

    text: By the way, that's what duolingo does as well - they really built-in gamification
      into learning and did it pretty well. If you haven't used it previously, check
      it out

    \ and for writing the first volume of this book \U0001F642 \U0001F64C\nI have\
    \ a few questions for you:-\n- The questions that you post on your website, for\
    \ instance, today's question, it is a mix of an algorithm taught in AI + another\
    \ taught in Data Science. So, this mix-and-match thing, is it something that you\
    \ intend to do? Trying to show similarities and differences between concepts from\
    \ similar fields.\n- Curiosity - how do you come up with these questions? Are\
    \ these some sort of interview questions or something that you come up with while\
    \ studying?\n- Are you planning to cover the recent advancements in NLP, CV etc.,\
    \ too via these questions?\nAll the best for your future endeavors \U0001F44D"

    text: "Hey Shaksham Kapoor!\n1. You\u2019ll see purely theoretical and practical\
      \ questions. They range from probabilities and statistics, to algorithms, machine\
      \ learning, data analysis, game theory and pretty much anything under the Artificial\
      \ Intelligence umbrella. This is on purpose: our goal is not to tackle one specialized\
      \ narrow area, but to find ways to increase the knowledge we all have.\n2. Some\
      \ of these are problems we deal with every day. Some are the result of what we\
      \ read or conversations we have with others. \n3. Absolutely! If it\u2019s useful,\

      \ not just focused on AWS but in general if anyone wants to prepare for a certification\

  text: What were the easiest and the most difficult questions so far?
  replies:
  - name: Santiago
    text: 'The hardest question so far was the one we published on April 19. It was
      about the Softmax activation function.

      The easiest question was the one we published on April 30. It was about the
      definition of hyperparameter tuning.'

    text: What was the question on april 19? maybe you could share the pages from
      the book with it? really curious about it
  - name: Santiago
    text: 'Here is the question:'
  - name: Alexey Grigorev
    text: 'Hmm I initially wanted to say it''s one, but softmax doesn''t get the input
      to the network. It gets the output of the previous dense layer.

      It also doesn''t return the index or the max value, so 2 and 4 are also our.

      The closest is 3, but it doesn''t sort the probabilities...

      So which one is it? =)'
  - name: Santiago
    text: "2 and 4 don\u2019t say that softmax returns that thing. They say that softmax\
      \ is a version of the function that returns that thing."
  - name: Santiago
    text: 'Basically, Option 2 says that Softmax is a smooth version of argmax

      Option 4 says that Softmax is a smooth version of max.'
  - name: Alexey Grigorev
    text: 'I guess then it''s probably that this value is max... then it''s option
      4?

      But I understand now why it was the most difficult one =)

      Thanks for sharing it!'

      look like?

    text: 'I write one question every day and review and schedule another question.

      Vladimir does the first round of reviews to everything I write. When he finishes,
      I let it sit for a couple of weeks before I do the final review.

      Leaving some time between the writing and the editing session is key to get
      a much stronger question.

      In summary, we write a question, then they go through a couple editing sessions
      before they get scheduled.'

    text: "When I write questions I try to write a couple at once. However, I have\
      \ to admit recently Santiago is writing almost all of them\u2026\nOne interesting\
      \ thing is that we do this fully asynchronously. We have a GitHub repo and we\
      \ use the issues. One issue is one question. The one who writes it assigns it\
      \ to the other one for review. We use several labels to track where the question\
      \ is in the pipeline."

      \ we are taking it very slow because we aren\u2019t sure how to compensate people\
      \ yet. Right now, I\u2019m working with a person that reached out to me to try\
      \ and explore how collaborations would look like. Based on the experience, we\
      \ will open it up to more people in the future.\n(The main issue with collaborations\
      \ is compensation and rights. We are using this question as comercial content,\
      \ so we need to ensure we retain the rights to the questions. That\u2019s why\
      \ we want to compensate those who contribute.)"

  text: 'Hi Santiago &amp; Vladimir Haltakov, I have a non-technical question.

    The concept of daily problems is a great choice (very much like the awesome [https://thedailybyte.dev/](https://thedailybyte.dev/)),
    and your mission statement is aligned with that idea (by mentioning the overwhelming
    amount of machine learning and data science books out there).

    But in essence, when I look at your subscription plans, it seems that your subscribers
    are getting a ML-DS book every month...

    Is there a more creative way to keep your subscribers engaged (and paying) instead
    of overwhelming them with more books?

    I don''t mean to sound sarcastic or patronizing, I''m truly curious!'
  replies:
  - name: Santiago
    text: "This is a great question. Just for now, the subscription will get people\
      \ every question we publish, but we will not stop there.\nWe have several ideas\
      \ to improve that subscription over time. Without promising much, I can tell\
      \ you that there\u2019s a lot of value in a community of machine learning and\
      \ data scientist professionals, so we are thinking on ways we can tap on that\
      \ and connect companies with individuals."
  - name: Vladimir Haltakov
    text: "I like to think about the books as a reference. The goal is to have people\
      \ coming to the website every day and answering the questions. As Santiago mentioned,\
      \ we are working on a kind of a leaderboard to gamify the process a little bit\
      \ \U0001F642\nThe book is if you want to go through the old questions. Maybe\
      \ you had a problem at work and remembered that you saw the question on Bnomial\
      \ and want to check it again and follow the reference link. Or maybe you are\
      \ preparing for an interview and want to test your knowledge on past questions?\
      \ Then you need the book."

    a question and the explanation for the answer every day
  replies:

  text: 'Do you think it would be helpful to include the concept of ELI5 in your current
    model? For instance, currently, the questions assume that anyone attempting it
    has background in AI (in general); however, that is not always the case.

    Therefore, it would be helpful if in future, you can explain the important concepts
    from stats, probability, ML, DL etc. in an ELI5 manner. I believe it will be very
    helpful, since it is difficult to find ELI5 examples of such concepts. Of course,
    for a few of these, you can find ELI5 explanations, but those are scattered across
    the web. So, a common place for anything like this would definitely be an extremely
    useful resource.'

      on more basic concepts and the explanation gives you more background about.

    questions (as far as I know from r/dailymachinelearning). It seems like your questions
    are more of case-study-type (from what I see at [today.bnomial.com](http://today.bnomial.com))

      have to write some simple code.'

  text: Very interesting Santiago and Vladimir Haltakov. Do you attempt to switch
    between more theory and more case-study related questions? Also, do you try to
    evenly cover different areas of ML or is the selection based on your experience/preference
    or just randomly?
  replies:
  - name: Santiago
    text: "For now, it\u2019s mostly random, although I try to ensure that questions\
      \ covering similar topics don\u2019t go out close to each other.\nWe have a\
      \ little bit of everything: there are purely theoretical questions, and other\
      \ more practical ones. We are planning to keep it that way with a slight bias\
      \ towards practicality.\nAnd undoubtedly, the flavor of the questions highly\
      \ depends on our own knowledge and experience. For example, I don\u2019t have\
      \ time-series analysis experience, so it\u2019s hard for me to write about that."

A different way to learn

This book aims to teach you something new, one question at a time.

There are 20,000 + 1 machine learning and data science books out there. That's great, but we wanted something different.

In April, we started publishing one machine learning question every day. A quick story with a problem and a few possible answers. Something quick, practical, and fun that you could solve in a few seconds. In just 30 days the site attracted more than 80,000 visitors and every day over 1,500 people answer the question and it keeps growing.

Many reached out asking for previous questions.

This book is a compendium of the 30 questions we published online from April 1 to April 30, 2022.
