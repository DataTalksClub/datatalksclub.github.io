Data Storytelling with Altair and AI teaches you how to build enhanced data visualizations using these tools. The book uses hands-on examples to build powerful narratives that can inform, inspire, and motivate. It covers the Altair data visualization library, along with AI techniques like generating text with ChatGPT, creating images with DALL-E, and Python coding with Copilot. Youâ€™ll learn by practicing with each interesting data story, from tourist arrivals in Portugal to population growth in the USA to fake news, salmon aquaculture, and more.
