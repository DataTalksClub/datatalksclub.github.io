  text: Hi to everyone, just to trigger the discussion. Do you think Generative AI
    is helpful in data storytelling?
  replies: []

  text: 'I think definitely yes! Generative AI helps people who are not good at Data
    storytelling, coding or data visualization.

    But it also let user to limit their imagination for creating or establishing their
    own ideas.'

  text: ps. I just start to read this book " [Data Storytelling with Altair and AI](https://datatalks.club/books/20240902-data-storytelling-with-altair-and-ai.html)"--truly
    amazing!

  text: I also wonder if anyone use AI to create dashboard-if yes, could you please
    share the expereinces with us?
  replies: []

  text: I like the idea that AI can increase imagination and creativity if you use
    it as a companion or friend with whom you can  discuss. My boss says that AI means
    Augmented Intelligence and not Artificial Intelligence. For example, I have used
    AI to improve a poetry I wrote!

  text: Following the same line, you can use AI not only to create your dashboard
    but to organize the visualizations based on the audience, or even to ask AI which
    metrics you should monitor in your case

  text: Thank you, Angelica! I also would like to know how your company deals with
    AI mapping/drawing? Because this issue is very polarised in Taiwan, some people
    think it's helpful, others think it's going to put a lot of designers out of a
    job.

    text: Your question is very interesting. I work in a research institution which
      uses AI only for research and not for business. However, I think that using
      AI for drawing is opening also ethical concerns. I have recently read a post
      which says that in Brazil children photos have been stolen from private blogs
      and social media to train AI models
  - name: Yi Huei
    text: Thank you for your reply. And really sorry to hear that the children's photos
      have been stolen in Brazil society...

  text: This is a very keen topic of interest for me and I have started reviewing
    this wonderful book. Thank you Angelica Lo Duca. One thing that I have concern
    about generativeAI is while its extremely helpful for cases where we use it as
    an assistant or supportive framework in order to consolidate or even data mining
    and feeding us with key information to guide us making data decisions. On the
    other hand during real customer use cases at times raises the question of data
    quality that is fed into the dashboards. Could I ask if there are different ways
    to measure the quality of data that is refined by generative AI to continuously
    measure the quality? More specifically what are some common measures we can use
    to measure the quality of extracted content from genAI before we use it for key
    dashboards or decision making.

    text: "This point is very interesting. Thanks for the question. Just recently,\
      \ I've been working on a project where I tried to evaluate the results of analysis\
      \ produced by AI. We are developing a system that is divided into two parts.\
      \ During the first phase, we calibrated the AI \u200B\u200Bmodel with some data.\
      \ Calibration is done manually with the help of a domain expert. When model\
      \ calibration is completed, we can move on to the production phase, where the\
      \ model is run on all the data. However, the expert should verify the results\
      \ on a sample basis. I have attached the designed system here."

Data Storytelling with Altair and AI teaches you how to build enhanced data visualizations using these tools. The book uses hands-on examples to build powerful narratives that can inform, inspire, and motivate. It covers the Altair data visualization library, along with AI techniques like generating text with ChatGPT, creating images with DALL-E, and Python coding with Copilot. Youâ€™ll learn by practicing with each interesting data story, from tourist arrivals in Portugal to population growth in the USA to fake news, salmon aquaculture, and more.
