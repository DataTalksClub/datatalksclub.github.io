Turning text into valuable information is essential for businesses looking to gain a competitive
advantage. With recent improvements in natural language processing (NLP), users now have many options
for solving complex challenges. But it's not always clear which NLP tools or libraries would work for

solutions to common tasks in text analytics and natural language processing.
