title: Machine Learning Algorithms in Depth
---

Machine Learning Algorithms in Depth dissects and explains dozens of algorithms across a variety of applications, including finance, computer vision, and NLP. Each algorithm is mathematically derived, followed by its hands-on Python implementation along with insightful code annotations and informative graphics. You’ll especially appreciate author Vadim Smolyakov’s clear interpretations of Bayesian algorithms for Monte Carlo and Markov models.
