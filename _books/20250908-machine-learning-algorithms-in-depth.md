Learn how machine learning algorithms work from the ground up so you can effectively troubleshoot your models and improve their performance.

This book guides you from the core mathematical foundations to Python implementations across a variety of applications, including finance, computer vision, and NLP. With a particular emphasis on probabilistic algorithms, you'll learn the fundamentals of Bayesian inference and deep learning. Each algorithm is mathematically derived, followed by hands-on implementation with insightful code annotations and informative graphics.
