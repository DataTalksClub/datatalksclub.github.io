It is something of a truism in data science, data analysis, or machine learning that most of
the effort needed to achieve your actual purpose lies in cleaning your data. Written in Davidâ€™s
signature friendly and humorous style, this book discusses in detail the essential steps performed
in every production data science or data analysis pipeline and prepares you for data visualization
and modeling results.


The book dives into the practical application of tools and techniques needed for data ingestion,
anomaly detection, value imputation, and feature engineering. It also offers long-form
exercises at the end of each chapter to practice the skills acquired.
