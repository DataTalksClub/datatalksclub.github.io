Great search is all about delivering the right results. Today’s search engines are expected to be smart,
understanding the nuances of natural language queries, as well as each user’s preferences and context.
AI-Powered Search teaches you the latest machine learning techniques to create search engines
that continuously learn from your users and your content, to drive more domain-aware and intelligent search.

This book empowers you to create and deploy search engines that take advantage of user interactions and
the hidden semantic relationships in your content to constantly get smarter and automatically deliver
better, more relevant search experiences.
