    text: "ASHISH SONI Thanks a lot for your question. For the first part - I would\
      \ say the ambition is to uncover specifics and complexity of data analytics\
      \ initiatives, in a structured and holistic manner. To answer the second portion\
      \ - after reading the book, the reader should have better understanding of analytical\
      \ work and its various types and  understand the complexity and typical challenges.\
      \ As a result he or she can better set up the analytics initiative for success\
      \ and avoid or be ready for typical challenges. Did I answer your question?\

  text: Hi everyone, thanks for being here! I would like to know what are the most
    common reasons for failure in analytics projects and are the reasons really that
    different depending on the type of project? Could you maybe provide an example?
  replies:
  - name: Ondrej Bothe
    text: 'Hi Tim Becker, thank you for your question.

      There could be many different reasons, why the project could fail. May be more
      preciously, why the insight is not delivered or used. This is caused by the
      complexity of an analytical work itself. In the book, we are trying to describe
      the Framework, how to deal with the complexity - how to describe it and understand
      the consequences and interdependencies. We believe that this approach will limit
      misunderstanding and miscommunication and allow us to define and focus on the
      most critical aspect of the work. The fact, that there is a common agreement
      and understanding of the critical area is itself limiting the probability of
      failure.

      For example, one project could fail, as we are not able to ingest/integrate
      data in the current IT ecosystem because of GDPR. Another could fail because
      we are not able to deploy an analytical model into production with proper operational
      support. Another could be considered a failure because the team was not able
      to find a model with "good enough" analytical results or design a report, that
      satisfies the requirements of consumers. Potentially, it could be all together
      as well. Did I answer your question?'

  text: 'Thank you for the book. I have few questions:

    1) How importance do you think to implement a strategy for analytic projects selection?

    2)Is this strategy should be handled by technical team during implementation or
    business team during initiation or it could be hybrid.

    Thank you.'

    text: 'Hi,

      thank you for your question.

      Regarding the first part: Project selection is potentially the follow-up process.
      First, we need to understand the type of the analytical project and the work,
      that need to happen to deliver successfully (from the data, IT and stakeholder
      perspective). Such consistency across the projects could help us to compare
      the initiatives one with another and decide, where to start. Also, the evaluation
      of business benefits needs to be considered (a lot connected with analytical
      maturity).

      Regarding the second part: Both IT (technical team) and business need to work
      closely together (potentially focusing on different areas of the project component).
      It is important to establish the evaluation as an ongoing process as analytical
      initiatives are developing over time, so the importance of different aspects
      is changing continuously.'

    startups, SME with limited budget or bug corporate who might have alot of projects

    text: Thanks a lot for your questions! The framework we are describing in the
      book can be applied to all analytical initiatives and we hope anyone can learn
      and apply the learning to their data analytics projects regardless the size
      of the company.  Biggest benefits it will probably have for folks from large
      companies, or corporations with higher complexity of analytical, technology
      and data landscape respectively.

  text: "Hey Ondrej Kubera David Bednar Ondrej Bothe Martin Potan\u010Dok,\nThanks\
    \ for sharing the book release.\nDoes the book approach analytics project as integration\

    \ business/engineering effort? (eg build an analytic stack with open source technologies).\
    \ Or both aspects are discussed?\nAlso, it is always good to learn from failures.\
    \ Were you able to get real life analytics project post-mortems into the book?"

    text: "Hi Cyril de Catheu , thanks for your question! We look at data analytics\

  text: Have you ever dealt with a project where there is no clear owner of a company
    data strategy which then means ownership in analytics projects becomes a huge
    point of concern? e.g. whos supporting the report once its completed or a model
    is developed but data scientist move on and models gather dust. How would you
    address this and does the book assist in complex project like this?
  replies:
  - name: Ondrej Bothe
    text: 'Hi Ash Smith, thank you.

      It looks like you have already read some chapters from the book and using the
      example from them :-) For sure it happened many times... It is difficult to
      help to address it - the book is trying to highlight and categorize such challenges
      as you stated, and bring them into the context (as there could be many others).
      In case you are aware of the risks at the beginning of the project, it is much
      easier to set up a proper expectation and so manage the delivery in time (it
      is interesting, that types of challenges are changing in time, as the analytical
      initiative is moving ahead). Did it help?'

The categorisation of analytical projects could help to simplify complexity reasonably and, at the same time, clarify the critical aspects of analytical initiatives. But how can this complex work be categorized? What makes it so complex?

Data Analytics Initiatives: Managing Analytics for Success emphasizes that each analytics project is different. At the same time, analytics projects have many common aspects, and these features make them unique compared to other projects. Describing these commonalities helps to develop a conceptual understanding of analytical work. However, features specific to each initiative affects the entire analytics project lifecycle. Neglecting them by trying to use general approaches without tailoring them to each project can lead to failure.

In addition to examining typical characteristics of the analytics project and how to categorise them, the book looks at specific types of projects, provides a high-level assessment of their characteristics from a risk perspective, and comments on the most common problems or challenges. The book also presents examples of questions that could be asked of relevant people to analyse an analytics project. These questions help to position properly the project and to find commonalities and general project challenges.
