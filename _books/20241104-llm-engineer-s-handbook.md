    \ just reading the rest of the answers alone leads to a lot of insights!\n1. Which\
    \ of the 2 approaches would you suggest, for summarizing pdfs with text, tables,\
    \ graphs etc: (a) parsing the pdf for text, feeding to llm for summary (b) using\
    \ a multimodal LLM for asking the summaries directly\n2. Curious to know if you\

    text: 'Thanks Prajwal Srinivas!

      1. I would definitely try to do it with multimodal models, it tends to work
      very well with those now. Especially for a task like summarization.

      2. Personally, I''m not too happy with the noise in the AI/LLM community, with
      projects that get a lot of hype and end up disappointing everyone (when they''re
      not complete scams).

      3. Scaling test-time compute is the most exciting trend to me because it can
      really skew the (training) scaling laws.'

      Prajwal Srinivas

      1. +1 on what Maxime Labonne said

      2. Similar to the noise issue, it is hard to differentiate between what is worth
      investing in and what is not. That''s why, most of the time, I focus on the
      fundamentals and ignore the latest tools/models until I really need them

      3. I am an engineering &amp; ops guy, so I would say all the automation possibilities
      LLMs open, allowing us to delegate more and more to machines while focusing
      on what matters'

      One last quick question:

      Would books be the best medium for learning about  LLMs, especially given the
      pace at which it is evolving. And how would one get the fundamentals right?
      So that it is easier to adapt to new releases'

      Honestly, I don''t fully know how to solve this, but here is how I would approach
      it. First, I would design a robust monitoring and evaluation pipeline with an
      LLM-as-a-judge to detect all kind of use cases where people try to hack your
      system. Then, based on this, you can either solve this true:

      - prompt engineering

      - a slim classifier for the user input to detect anomalies

      - a slim classier to the output to detect anomalies

      - I would avoid using another LLM to detect anomalies

      each scenario.'

  text: 'Hey Maxime Labonne,Paul Iusztin - I''ve got some non-technical questions.

    Super curious to get your perspective on the questions below:

    1. When implementing LLM-powered systems within a corporate setting, what unique
    challenges do you encounter compared to more technical environments? Could you
    share specific examples of operational or resource-related hurdles, such as cross-department
    collaboration, integrating with existing tech stacks, or ensuring data compliance
    with corporate policies?

    2. In your experience, what are/could be the main non-technical barriers when
    deploying LLMs in corporate environments? For instance, have you faced resistance
    due to organizational change, concerns over job displacement, or misunderstandings
    about the technology''s capabilities? How do you overcome these non-technical
    obstacles to secure stakeholder buy-in and facilitate adoption?

    3. What are some real-world examples of aligning LLM projects with the strategic
    goals and KPIs of a corporation? Specifically, how do you navigate the balancing
    act between achieving high model performance and adhering to business objectives
    like cost-efficiency, user experience, and scalability within corporate constraints?'

    text: 'Hello Edalheim

      Since the apparition of LLMs, I worked only in start-ups, but here are my thoughts:

      1. People don''t want to integrate ChatGPT or Claude due to privacy concerns.
      They want to use open-source tools but lack the expertise to implement it.

      2. Linked to question 1, I would start by finding providers that host open-source
      models such as Groq.

      3. I would first focus on model performance, then try to optimize it based on
      the highest priority (cost-efficiency, user experience, etc.). Usually, you
      cannot have everything since iteration 1. But by having the required performance
      it''s easier to control and evaluate the optimization steps.'

      For cost-friendly environments, I would avoid AWS (even if I love their offering).

      You can pick a serverless vector DB provider such as Qdrant or Mongo to scale

      As for hosting your model, I would still go with a serverless option, such as

      Well, the most common pitfall for continuous training is to ask yourself if

      for knowledge insertion, RAG can be a better option as you can easily trace
      the source and its metadata, ensuring trust in your response.

Artificial intelligence has undergone rapid advancements, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the forefront of this revolution. This LLM book offers insights into designing, training, and deploying LLMs in real-world scenarios by leveraging MLOps best practices. The guide walks you through building an LLM-powered twin that’s cost-effective, scalable, and modular. It moves beyond isolated Jupyter notebooks, focusing on how to build production-grade end-to-end LLM systems. Throughout this book, you will learn data engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and deployment. The hands-on approach to building the LLM Twin use case will help you implement MLOps components in your own projects.
