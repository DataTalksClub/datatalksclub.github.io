Companies are spending billions on machine learning projects, but it’s money wasted if the models
can’t be deployed effectively. In this book, Hannes Hapke and Catherine Nelson walk you through
the steps of automating a machine learning pipeline using the TensorFlow ecosystem.
You’ll learn the techniques and tools that will cut deployment time from days to minutes,
so that you can focus on developing new models rather than maintaining legacy systems.
