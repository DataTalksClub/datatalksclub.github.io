    text: "It's a lot, and can feel overwhelming. First things first \u2014 ask recruiters\
      \ what you need to know, check this via Glassdoor, or better narrow down your\
      \ search and only apply to most relevant titles. For example... System Design\
      \ might be more for Data Engineer or ML Eng roles... not DS or Data Analyst.\
      \ Similarly, ML Eng might not be tested on SQL but more LeetCode style question.\
      \ This narrows down the space of things to know."

    text: "But to get to the core of the question; balance. I have no idea, it's deeply\
      \ personal. I struggle to balance cooking healthy, working out, with my career\

    text: echoing what Nick said - focus on the particular job you want and what those
      job descriptions encompass. Product analytics roles will heavily focus on SQL/Product
      sense vs. ML eng which is coding &amp; ML for example. Also depending on the
      company and role you will want either more breadth (FB product DS) or depth
      (Netflix ML research) so you should allocate your studying time accordingly

  replies:
  - name: Nick Singh
    text: spaced repetition. I've been exposed to it, multiple times, over multiple
      years, that even if I don't remember every detail I know what I can look up,
      or can easily refresh myself. No other way around it!
  - name: Kevin
    text: Also it helps to practice the fundamentals - ML (like many technical topics)
      is not easy for rote memorization, and being able to pattern match among different
      use cases &amp; fields is nice

  text: What do you think is wrong about the current practices in tech companies when
    it comes to DS interviews?
  replies:
  - name: Nick Singh
    text: Coding questions often asked are too hard. When was the last time a DS needed
      to know about a tree structure or used a Linked List. Come to think of it...
      do even SWEs use Linked Lists? I think those leetcode style questions are already
      sorta dumb for evaluating SWE talent, and lazy thinking ported it over to DS.
  - name: Kevin
    text: What Nick said also applies to hard technical questions in ML/Stats/Prob
      land for ML research / ML eng and quant roles (in finance) although it's more
      relevant since for deeply technical roles you should know the fundamentals well
      (for example if you are doing ML research you should understand the math behind
      the algorithms)

  text: What would an ideal interviewing approach look like?
  replies:
  - name: Nick Singh
    text: An early filtering round. Quick phone call about projects/background, throw
      in 1-2 stat/ML theory questions, and have them write a simple SQL query. Maybe
      of load some of this to a recruiter if possible. Then do 2 more technical rounds.
      First technical round is something more academic/textbook... aka a data manipulation/cleaning
      exercise, some more theoretical questions (what's your favorite modeling technique
      and why... probe if they just call sci-kit learn or really know what they are
      doing and understand the fundamentals). ... and then something more open-ended
      / how would you approach this real-world problem we are dealing with. Do they
      have business sense. Then a final behavioral interview to understand what this
      person is done, how fast they are growing, and whether they actually are interested
      in the job.

  text: "Hello Kevin and Nick thank you for writing the book. \nMy questions are:\
    \ \n1. How to prepare theoretical topics for data science interview. As we see\
    \ the job description keeps increasing every day. Even when you are confident\
    \ about performing a concept practically how can we answer the theory question.\
    \ Basic example: SVD is one question which I feel is vast, I know what SVD is\
    \ but how to trim my answer to explain it to interviewer. You can even explain\
    \ it using any other topic I want to understand the general approach \n2. Now\
    \ a days most of data science job description wants hands-on experience even if\
    \ we know the concepts we don't get the interview, resume gets selected but HR\
    \ asks for hands on experience and people like me don't have any. Hence how can\
    \ we answer that question to HR person asking us. \U0001F604"
  replies:
  - name: Kevin
    text: 1. one way I have found effective is to do mock interviews with friends
      or others - when you can explain deeply technical concepts in a succinct manner
      then you understand them quite well. also one tip for me personally is not memorizing
      any specific equations - if you focus just on rote textbook memorization, then
      when thrown a curveball, just like an ML algorithm you'll have overfit your
      knowledge. 2) doing projects is super helpful here, to demonstrate that you
      are proactive, driven, and passionate about using data science for XYZ

    text: 1. depends on your background (they will ask about your research experience
      if you have any) and then depending on research or eng will be more or less
      theoretical, 2) no since otherwise it's a chicken &amp; egg problem - that being
      said, the interviews are there for them to gain confidence that you understand
      the models well enough theoretically and also have some experience (whether
      through projects or research etc) to be a good fit

      be a team player and questions that are in those areas may range from something

  - name: Kevin
    text: Depends on the person and how much time spent per day - generally a few
      months of full time effort should be good enough to be quite proficient in any

      okay timeline roughly speaking

  text: Hi Kevin  and Nick Singh, thank you for doing this! My question for you today
    is that generally the job descriptions are pretty vague.  Should we prepare for
    all the required topics mentioned, or focus on the major ones? And how do we get
    to know what would be the major requirement in that particular role? Can you please
    specify what a person should be prepared with for an entry level position or internship
    in data science?
  replies:
  - name: Nick Singh
    text: Focus on the major ones, but generally most roles look for similar things.
      So one way to get a sense of what's important is just to look at the same type
      of role... and across multiple companies you'll get a sense of it. For example,
      for most Product Data Science roles you'll see mentions of Exploratory Data
      Analysis, SQL, A/B Testing, and "supporting product/business teams" == biz acumen
      and product sense.
  - name: Kevin
    text: +1 to what Nick said, for entry level it's more about the fundamentals than
      anything too specific so be sure to brush up based on the relevant area (Product
      analytics is a lot of SQL &amp; product sense for example, whereas ML eng is
      coding &amp; systems design &amp; ML)

  text: Hi Kevin and Nick, thanks for coming to share about your book! When preparing
    for interviews, how do you suggest a person approach learning different topics
    (programming, stats, machine learning, etc)? Should he/she learn all at the same
    time or each topic after each other? Also during interviews, how can an interviewee
    address some technical topics that he/she does not know or use yet but is aware
    of and could pick up later if got the job?
  replies:
  - name: Kevin
    text: Definitely depends on the person - with so many topics it can feel like
      a firehose (I personally like doing brief deep dives but then rotating among
      topics). If you get asked those topics you should just admit you don't know
      / don't have any experience in the space - in general interviewers shouldn't
      press too hard for this as long as you don't put random buzzwords on your resume
      that you can't explain thoughtfully

  text: Hi Nick and Kevin, thank to you both for taking the time here to answer questions
    here and share about your book, really appreciate it!  How would you suggest that
    people in an existing technical role best approach the process of transitioning
    to DS/ML?   Relatedly, If someone has relatively strong DS/ML knowledge but lacks
    actual DS/ML work experience, how to best overcome this issue?  Side projects
    to build up a portfolio of demonstrable skills?
  replies:

      the more work experience you have, the more emphasis that will play in interviews

      interviews and in the process itself varies with role/company but I find that
      for the former, it generally has a decent weight the less direct job experience

    text: 1) I've looked at some of MIT OCW for technical topics and for ML there's
      a lot out (Andrew Ng's material for example) there so will need to come back
      to this. 2) they generally act as a technical PM so basically they interface
      with ML engineers/researchers etc. and hence very similar to regular PM except
      that they need to understand and speak the technical jargon

  text: "Hey Nick Singh and Kevin Kev, great to see you guys here I follow you on\
    \ LinkedIn you both post great stuff. My questions would be what kind of projects\
    \ would make you stand out of the crowd in relation with analyst-consulting based\
    \ roles? Is it a good practice to research about the work already being done in\
    \ a company you are applying to for a particular role? Does it come up as being\
    \ a kiss up to recruiters?\nShould I really work at my DSA if I am planning for\
    \ DS roles only and not at MLOps or MLE profile? In case I find myself wanting\
    \ to get into MLE, how much swe knowledge do I need to function as a good MLE?\
    \ Do official certifications from tech giants like TF developer from Google or\
    \ others like IBM, Nvidia really boost up placement chances in these companies?\
    \ I was told that they do but still it would be better if you could throw some\
    \ light on it. \nOne final question apart from academia.\nAlso how to deal with\
    \ that overwhelming feeling when you know there's a lot to cover(coding+stats+SQL+ML\
    \ to name a few) but time is a constraint? \nSorry for throwing a lot haha\nCheers\
    \ and all the best for your book. Looking forward to read it once it's available\
