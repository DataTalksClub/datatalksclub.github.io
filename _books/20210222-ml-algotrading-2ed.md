The explosive growth of digital data has boosted the demand for expertise in trading strategies
that use machine learning (ML). This thoroughly revised and expanded second edition enables you
to build and evaluate sophisticated supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning models.

This edition introduces end-to-end machine learning for the trading workflow, from the idea and
feature engineering to model optimization, strategy design, and backtesting. It illustrates this
workflow using examples that range from linear models and tree-based ensembles to deep-learning
techniques from the cutting edge of the research frontier.
