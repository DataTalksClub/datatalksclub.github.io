Reinforcement learning (RL) will deliver one of the biggest breakthroughs in AI over the next decade,
enabling algorithms to learn from their environment to achieve arbitrary goals. This exciting development
avoids constraints found in traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms. This practical book shows data
science and AI professionals how to learn by reinforcement and enable a machine to learn by itself.
