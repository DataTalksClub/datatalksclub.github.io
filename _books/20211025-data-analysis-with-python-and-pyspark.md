When it comes to data analytics, it pays to think big. PySpark blends the powerful Spark big data
processing engine with the Python programming language to provide a data analysis platform that can
scale up for nearly any task. Data Analysis with Python and PySpark is your guide to delivering successful
Python-driven data projects.

Packed with relevant examples and essential techniques, this practical book teaches you to build
lightning-fast pipelines for reporting, machine learning, and other data-centric tasks.
No previous knowledge of Spark is required.
