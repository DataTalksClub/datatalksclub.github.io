  text: "Thank you Prateek Joshi on writing this book. The book includes some interesting\
    \ chapters about Heuristics, GA  and gaming in AI which is very helpful.  The\
    \ book seems comprehensive and targeted for python developers which is great.\n\
    What python libraries is used for GA and Heuristics? \nAlso, in comparison to\
    \ matlab for GA and heuristic, Does python provide advantages? \nIn logic programming\
    \ where lisp and prolog are dominating, In which areas  python can give cutting\
    \ edges?\nThank you again for this comprehensive book that address other parts\
    \ of AI rather than ML."

    text: "Dr Abdulrahman Baqais Thank you for the kind words and the question.\n\
      With regards to Python libraries, I\u2019ve experimented with simpleai for Heuristics\
      \ and DEAP for GA. They provide most of the functions you\u2019d need.\nWith\
      \ regards Python vs Matlab, I prefer Python because it\u2019s more production\
      \ ready. You can build an application and deploy it without having to redo the\
      \ work. It\u2019s lightweight compared to Matlab (which matters a lot when you\u2019\
      re deploying). Plus the Python community is huge, which means you can get answers\
      \ to your questions relatively easily.\nFor logic programming, the big advantage\
      \ of Python is interoperability. When you\u2019re working on a tool that\u2019\
      s in production, different parts of the product can use different frameworks.\
      \ Python plays well with all the cloud tools, so plugging in your tool into\
      \ the larger product becomes easy. Plus you get access to many people who are\
      \ constantly building and experimenting in Python. You don\u2019t have to reinvent\
      \ the wheel for many underlying methods/functions you end up using."

      for AI.....one programming language to work on all AI projects.

      \ act of showing up everyday helped develop my writing muscle in my early days.\
      \ This allowed me get the work done on time. By after 13 books, I had nothing\
      \ new left to say. So decided to take a break. \U0001F642"

  text: Hi Prateek, thanks for taking the time here to answer questions. What advice
    would you give to someone with many years of experience in database technology
    that is looking to switch to data science / machine learning.

    text: "Allan: Thank you for the question. Given your years of experience in database\
      \ technology, you already have a leg up here. Being proficient in data wrangling\
      \ is a great skill to have.\nIf you want to switch to DS/ML, my recommendation\
      \ is to get familiar with basic ML concepts and start doing projects.\n- Pick\
      \ a domain that interests you e.g. search engines, healthcare, image recognition,\
      \ ecommerce, fintech, recommender systems.\n- Once you do, look for problems\
      \ that seem interesting e.g. how to identify at-risk patients or how to identify\
      \ repeat buyers on an ecommerce site\n- There are a large number of open source\
      \ datasets available. You can use them to train your model.\n- The goal is to\
      \ start from a real problem and build a tool that addresses the problem in a\
      \ practical way.\nOnce you finish it, I\u2019d also recommend you write a brief\
      \ blog post (500-700 words) explaining what you did. This will help you strengthen\
      \ your own understanding.\nAs you continue to do this over time, you can develop\
      \ a good understanding of how to DS / ML to solve real world problems. Hope\
      \ this helps."

  text: "Hi Prateek Joshi, thanks for answering questions \U0001F642\n- Why was it\
    \ time for a second edition of your book? \n- For what kind of problems would\
    \ you suggest logic programming?\n- What is the most difficult part of building\
    \ a startup? What is your advice if someone wants to do it?"
  replies:
  - name: Prateek Joshi
    text: "Tim Becker Thank you for the questions \U0001F642 Here are my thoughts:\n\
      1. Publishing the second edition was mainly a function of demand. I received\
      \ many positive responses from readers for the first edition. Plus they gave\
      \ a lot of good feedback. This led to us publishing the second edition. It gave\
      \ us a chance to incorporate all the feedback and add new chapters as well.\n\
      2. Logic programming is a programming paradigm (like objected-oriented or functional\
      \ programming). It looks for solutions using facts and rules. Once we specify\
      \ a goal, the solver comes up with a tree that constitutes the search space\
      \ to solve the problem. We can provide raw input and then ask questions about\
      \ the missing pieces. Here are a few examples where we can use logic programming:\
      \ matching mathematical expressions, validating prime numbers, inferring relationships\
      \ in a family tree, analyzing geography, solving puzzles\n3. With regards to\
      \ building a startup, the most difficult part depends on the stage you\u2019\
      re at. It can go from: talking to potential users/customers to see if your product\
      \ needs to exist in this world --&gt; fundraising --&gt; getting the first 10\
      \ paying customers --&gt; demonstrating product market fit --&gt; recruiting\
      \ early teammates --&gt; fundraising again --&gt; scaling up revenue --&gt;\
      \ recruiting leaders who can build out different functions (sales, marketing,\
      \ product).\nThere are many other parts that can pop up during the journey as\
      \ well.\nMy advice to someone who wants to do it would be to to just get started.\
      \ The first step would be to reach out to as many potential users/customers\
      \ and understand how they get their work done today. Your way of getting that\
      \ work done should 10X better than status quo. That\u2019s how you know there\u2019\
      s a real gap."
