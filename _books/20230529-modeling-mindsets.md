title: Modeling Mindsets
---

Books on modeling often jump right into math and methods. Drowned in detail, it can take years to appreciate the assumptions and limitations of the various modeling mindsets. Written in a clear and concise style, Modeling Mindsets introduces approaches such as Bayesian inference, supervised learning, causal inference, and more.

After reading this book, you will have a much better understanding of the different approaches to modeling and be able to choose the right one for your problem.
