  replies:
  - name: Joyce Kay Avila
    text: Great question Low Kim Hoe!  In early days (2015), Snowflake's original
      positioning was "The Data Warehouse Buiilt for the Cloud".  While Snowflake
      was hugely successful with its data warehouse offering, there was so much more
      that was possible with Snowflake beyond data warehousing.  Thus, in 2019, Snowflake
      branded itself as THE "Data Cloud".  This rebranding  helped call out Snowflake's
      ability to federate the data and the fact that Snowflake was built from the
      ground up to be a data sharing platform (the actual workload is now called  the
      "Data Collaboration" workload).  Therefore, to answer your question, it is preferred
      to use the term "Snowflake Data Cloud".

      are both great products, depending on the use case, so I don't think there will

      Snowflake and Databricks, for a variety of reasons.  However, I have a preference
      for Snowflake (probably no big surprise to you!) over Databricks.  The general
      consensus, and what I've experienced, is that Snowflake is easier to get up
      and running right away and overall costs are lower with Snowflake when you consider
      the specialized (and costly) skillset needed to implement and manage a Databricks
      project.

  text: Hi Joyce Kay Avila Snowflake is easy to manage if we have small environment.
    Once the environment is big (i.e. 100s of DB and PBs of data) , its difficult
    to manage (as a platform admin) as we have role/grant explosions (i.e., Thousands
    of grants). How do you see this and how to easily (with minimal effort) manage?
  replies:
  - name: Joyce Kay Avila
    text: 'Excellent question Buvan

      There is no one right answer to this question.  Without knowing more details
      about your architecture and role requirements, I''ll provide a high level response
      with some suggestions.

      There are things you can use within Snowflake to (1) help streamline and optimize
      role management, and/or (2) processes you can put in place, and then (3) there
      are also tools that you might want to consider.

      You might want to consider designating some databases as having open access
      to make it clear which data, if any, is available to all. While this prevents
      interruption to data consumers'' access, it could pose a security and compliance
      risk.

      Some organizations have had success in simplifying management by defining only
      a limited number of roles per most databases. One example would be to have a
      Read Only and a Creator role per database.

      Using role hierarchies is also a great way to create an abstraction layer where
      roles can gain access to other roles'' privileges through inheritance.  If you
      are  not currently using role hierarchies, this is definitely one thing I''d
      recommend researching to see if it is appropriate for your use case.

      When user / role management is an activity that requires a dedicated resource
      or team, you could consider using ServiceNow or Salesforce Case functionality
      where users can request new user accounts and/or roles.  This also allows you
      to document requests and have an approval process in place.

      Also, you could take a look at Dataops.live which can be used to help manage
      a large number of roles. See this article for more details: [https://www.dataops.live/blog/security-considerations-ina-dataops-world](https://www.dataops.live/blog/security-considerations-ina-dataops-world)'

  replies:
  - name: Joyce Kay Avila
    text: 'There are two reasons why I don''t think you need an extensive background
      in data engineering to get the most out of the book jjp.

      First, in comparison to other data cloud platforms, Snowflake is cosidered to
      be a much easier platform on which to design and deploy.  Even if you are not
      a career data engineer, you should be able to understand most (if not all) of
      the concepts in the book, including the data engineering topics.

      Second, the book was purposely designed so that each chapter stands on its own.  That
      way, if there is some specific knowledge you want (that is not related to data
      engineering, for example)  or need right away then you can tackle that chapter
      first without having to complete any previous chapter exercises.  If, for example,
      you have a need to learn about Snowflake administration (i.e., user and role
      management) then you can gain a good understanding of that material.  Later,
      you can dive into Snowflake data loading and unloading or other data engineering
      related topics.'

    text: 'The book wasn''t really meant to provide a comparison between Snowflake
      and other solutions.  The intent of the book is to inform and educate the reader
      about Snowflake, assuming the reader is someone who has already decided on Snowflake
      or who wants to know more about Snowflake to be able to decide if Snowflake
      is a good fit for them.

      That said, there are many reasons why individuals and companies choose Snowflake.  Data
      storage factors (i.e., the amazing Snowflake micropartitions, for example and
      the fact that Snowflake bills customers based on compressed data size) are one
      consideration.  Other reasons include ease of use (powerful web UI capabilities,
      can access existing cloud data, time travel capabilities, simple role based
      access and more), and the existence of Snowflake workload capabilities such
      as data collaboration (data sharing) for which Snowflake is incredibly well-known
      for.

      And it isn''t necessarily that Snowflake would be the only data storage solution
      selected although Snowflake supports data warehousing and data lake workloads,
      among others.  In larger organizations, it is not uncommon to have Snowflake
      in addition to another different data storage solution.  It really depends on
      the use case(s).'

    text: 'Excellent question Alejandro Marmol!  Many of the clients I see getting
      started with Snowflake are looking to improve their insights so they are not
      necessarily at the beginning stages of their data journey.  That said, I don''t
      think there is necessarily a right or wrong time to apply Snowflake.

      The really great thing about Snowflake is that if the use case lends itself
      to using Snowflake, you can get started right away.  For example, if you already
      have data sources that exist in the cloud (in an S3 bucket, for example), you
      don''t even necessarily need to move the data into Snowflake to be able to surface
      and use the data for insights right away in Snowflake!

      Another specific example I frequently see is clients who have their logic built
      into a BI tool which locks them into that specific BI tool; they''re looking
      to extract that logic from the BI tool and put it into Snowflake instead which
      allows them to have more of a "Bring Your Own BI Tool" (BYOT) approach.

      Because Snowflake implementation and maintenance rely primarily on having some
      SQL knowledge, no unique or hard-to-find skillsets are needed which means it
      is really a good choice to get started with at any data maturity stage.'

      you''d probably want to be knowledgeable about data warehousing and know a little

    text: 'Yes Snowflake does offer a free 30 day trial -- [https://signup.snowflake.com/](https://signup.snowflake.com/)

      Here is a tip for you Roman Zabolotin -- Snowflake gives you a full 30 day trial
      where the time starts on the first day of the next month.  So, for example,
      if you sign up for a free trial the first week of the month, you''ll get the
      remaining 3 weeks of the month plus the full next month.  The free trial is
      that 30+ time period or $400 usage credits, whichever one comes first.  So,
      you''ll want to be smart about how you use the Snowflake trial org so you don''t
      run out of usage credits.  The amount ($400) is a large amount of usage credits
      so it''s unlikely you''d run out of usage credits but I just wanted to call
      that out.  The usage credits start from the first day that you create the trial
      account and go through the life of the trial account.'
