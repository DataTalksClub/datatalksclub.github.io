transcript:
- line: "This week, we'll talk about business acumen. We have a special guest today,\
    \ Thom. Thom is a data scientist with a PhD in mechanical engineering, a multiphysics\
    \ engineer and a Python-loving geek who lives in the United States. That's probably\
    \ not a very long bio, but Thom knows a lot of things. I watched a lot of different\
    \ events with Thom and I know that Thom can talk about pretty much everything\
    \ \u2013 any data-related topic, Thom knows something about it. It's a great pleasure\
    \ to welcome you, Thom, today on this show. Hi."

  time: '1:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Hi, Alexey. I'm really glad to be here. I want to qualify something you said.\
    \ I know a little bit about a lot of things, but I don't know a lot about a few\
    \ things. Or maybe I know a lot about a few things \u2013 I hope so. But one thing\
    \ that helps a lot, and I always like to emphasize is, you can learn a lot more\
    \ if you focus on concepts rather than details."

  who: Thom
- header: "Thom\u2019s background"
- line: "Actually, I wanted to invite you to this event for a long time. But I was\
    \ struggling to think what we could discuss. Usually these talks have a topic\
    \ \u2013 it\u2019s a themed discussion. The discussion can be about something\
    \ such as business acumen, as is our topic today. But I knew that you could talk\
    \ about anything. We talked together about full-stack data scientists, and I saw\
    \ you talking with Danny about pretty much everything. Whatever the audience wants\
    \ to know, you were there being able to answer questions about it. I also know\
    \ you host events talking about transformers and other very theoretical things.\
    \ Then there are things that you share on LinkedIn \u2013 whether it\u2019s SQL\
    \ or machine learning comparability theory \u2013 basically a whole range of different\
    \ things. But I finally found a topic \u2013 business acumen."
  sec: 138
  time: '2:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Before we go into this main topic of business acumen, I wanted to ask you
    to tell us in a few words about your background. Can you tell us about your career
    journey so far?
  who: Alexey
- line: "Absolutely. I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. I had the honor of being\
    \ senior class president of my very large Dallas high school. I was an awkward\
    \ jock growing up \u2013 a competitive swimmer. Then I went off to the big bad\
    \ University of Texas at Austin to get a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.\
    \ Soon after that, I went into my nation's naval nuclear program and I went through\
    \ the same training that an able ensign would go through, but I was working for\
    \ one of the contractors that serve the naval nuclear program. When I arrived\
    \ at the prototype training on real Naval Reactors \u2013 they were land based-back\
    \ then \u2013 I went through the same training with the naval officers. But when\
    \ we completed, they went out to sea, whereas I stayed at the Platte and helped\
    \ with the operations, maintenance, and training of the new naval personnel coming\
    \ through. I wasn't happy enough with that, so I went to grad school."
  sec: 201
  time: '3:21'
  who: Thom
- line: "For a while, I managed the research reactor at Texas A&M University, and\
    \ then got my Master\u2019s and PhD in mechanical engineering there. My Master\u2019\
    s focused on robotics and further research, while my PhD focused on design and\
    \ modeling of hybrid electric vehicle power plants. That's when I really started\
    \ to dive into data science-type topics. We didn't call it data science back then.\
    \ I was learning neural networks\u2026 What's that?"
  who: Thom
- line: What did you call it back then?
  sec: 309
  time: '5:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Just whatever sub-topic we were learning. I first realized, \u201COh, there\
    \ are limits to what we can do with classical physics-based modeling and control\
    \ systems design.\u201DOne of my controls professors was teaching fuzzy logic\
    \ and expert systems \u2013 I loved that course \u2013 then I started studying\
    \ neural networks. There was no Python back then, so we were coding this up from\
    \ scratch, and C or whatever, and doing our own memory allocation. We did some\
    \ pretty cool things back then with that, and I ended up needing some AI in the\
    \ modeling that I did for my PhD. Then I moved to the Boise area, way back in\
    \ \u201897."
  sec: 311
  time: '5:11'
  who: Thom
- line: "I started out as manager of advanced products for a small company that made\
    \ automated wet-action cleaning tools for the semiconductor industry. But I felt\
    \ like the leadership was going to bury the company, so I moved over to HP. I\
    \ was there for almost 17 years. Then I moved over to ON Semiconductor. Over the\
    \ course of that, I mentored a lot of younger people, either working on their\
    \ advanced degrees or needing help with modeling things. Of course, we were very\
    \ test-centric in laserjets, but I did a lot of other things there too. At ON\
    \ Semiconductor, that was really like a factory of data science-type work \u2013\
    \ algorithm development, primarily \u2013 but I was able to try out and achieve\
    \ some really cool machine learning there. That was a combination of unsupervised,\
    \ but where the model could figure out its own labels on the fly."
  who: Thom
- line: "Then, most recently, I was at UL as a lead data scientist for their prospector\
    \ SaaS. Prospector serves up a database through their SaaS \u2013 it's the world's\
    \ largest database for plastics, paints, coatings, personal care and cosmetics.\
    \ I was developing an AI to process unstructured data for them. Now, I just took\
    \ some time off to look for a new job because I realized I needed to move on.\
    \ So that's where I'm at."
  who: Thom
- line: "Probably the thing I'm most proud of, Alexey, is that about a couple years\
    \ ago, young people on LinkedIn started reaching out to me for help. To make a\
    \ long story short, my help (shocking to me) was considered very helpful. My followers\
    \ grew and I ended up being overwhelmed by one-on-one mentoring requests. So,\
    \ now we do a thing we call \u2018integrated mentoring\u2019. It was originally\
    \ the name of my blog, \u2018integrated machine learning and AI\u2019, but now\
    \ it's a community. We're approaching 1000 people in our Slack workgroup. We have\
    \ Saturday morning integrated mentoring, me and one of the other gentlemen who's\
    \ now my best friend in the world, Ghaith Sankari \u2013 we're writing a book\
    \ together. We're also teaching a course for free to test out our book material.\
    \ I also have a couple of Tech Time chats each week. So we're still figuring ourselves\
    \ out and growing. But we have a motto, called \u201Cmore together\u201D. We just\
    \ all want to grow and learn and we're helping each other do that. That's our\
    \ spirit."
  who: Thom
- line: Yeah, that's very cool. I'll make sure to add any links that you will send
    me about the course you're doing. You mentioned a book, you mentioned the community,
    LinkedIn. I'll make sure to include all that.

- header: Importance of business acumen
- line: "Coming back to our main topic \u2013 business acumen. Before this meeting,\
    \ I looked up what \u2018acumen\u2019 means and the definition I got was \u201C\
    the ability to make good judgments and make quick decisions\u201D. So, I wanted\
    \ to ask you, \u201CWhat is business acumen? Why is it important for data professionals\
    \ \u2013 for data scientists and others?\u201D"
  sec: 552
  time: '9:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: I want to tell the audience that what I'm about to share is stuff that I learned
    the hard way. Quite humbling, I should add. When it came to leading a group of
    engineers in design, and applying design methodology, I felt pretty skilled at
    that. But when it came to really designing a product for the market, I realized
    I had a lot to learn. The first thing that helped me a lot was discovering that,
    after I'd learned some great design methodology, and I'd learned the six thinking
    hats for managing egos, and debates that are prevalent in my culture, I came across
    a gentleman named Steve Blank out of Stanford. He was a professor there at the
    time. Now he's a consultant, I think he's retired from being a professor at Stanford.
    But he really got my attention with the spirit of customer-centric design. He
    just was at a very high level to get the spirit of it across. I would say it's
    this.

- line: "By the way, I'm speaking to business acumen in the sense of \u201CHow would\
    \ a data scientist fit into exercising good business acumen?\u201D Well, the first\
    \ thing I would say is, \u201CDon't burden yourself with being a domain expert,\
    \ or a subject matter expert \u2013 or having exceptional business acumen at the\
    \ company or organization you're serving.\u201D Why do I say that? I'm not saying\
    \ don't try to get good at it. But if you go in and tell a leader of the business\
    \ what they need to hear from you. They're going to look at you like, \u201CI\
    \ run this business. I know what the concerns are.\u201D So I encourage all data\
    \ scientists \u2013 don't go in that way. Go in with \u201CWhat are your biggest\
    \ concerns? What are the things that cause you to be afraid? What are the things\
    \ that keep you up at night? I want to know those things. Then what I want to\
    \ tell you I'm going to do \u2013 I'm going to go look at our current data assets\
    \ and I'm going to create a matrix. I'm going to look for the strongest intersection\
    \ of \u2018business need\u2019 and \u2018current data assets\u2019. And if there's\
    \ a business need that was really high that we didn't have adequate data assets\
    \ for, I will encourage collection of the data we need to answer questions for\
    \ that. But I want to get started right away!\u201D Then it's a spirit. Now let's\
    \ bring Steve Blank into the picture."
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Thom
- line: "Sorry for interrupting you, but the advice you just mentioned is a bit controversial.\
    \ You're saying \u201CDo not focus on being the best domain expert, because this\
    \ is not your job as a data scientist. Instead ask your management about, \u2018\
    What is important?\u201D Do I get that right?"
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. Because, how can you be a really good data scientist and a domain\
    \ expert? In fact, when I'm in an interview where someone seemingly wants me to\
    \ show that I'm a domain expert in their domain, I am almost tempted, Alexey,\
    \ to say, \u201CI think I'm in the wrong interview. I was interviewing for a data\
    \ scientist position. The kind of questions you're asking me right now \u2013\
    \ I would create a framework and go fill it in by talking to the domain experts.\
    \ Because how can I be a domain expert and a data scientist? I want to serve the\
    \ domain experts and the business leaders.\u201D And if that's controversial,\
    \ I will continue to be politely controversial on these points."

- header: Deliver crap as fast as possible
- line: "I think it's important to improve our business acumen in the domain that\
    \ we're serving. But let me say this. You've heard the adage \u201C80% of machine\
    \ learning models don't make it into production\u201D? Well, my first question,\
    \ and I speak on this with my dear friend \u2013 we call each other brothers,\
    \ Greg Coquillo, he's a technology specialist manager at Amazon \u2013 we make\
    \ the point that, \u201CHey, let's take the focus on that. What we're really looking\
    \ for is a return on data. What if, as we're looking for opportunities to develop\
    \ machine learning models, we've gained so many insights along the way that now\
    \ we have a good data story? That data story can help the business.\u201D Well,\
    \ we're going to deliver that before we worry about putting a machine learning\
    \ model into production. So let's take the focus off of \u2018how many machine\
    \ learning models get into production\u2019 and let's have the focus on \u2018\
    how much value are we deriving from our data?\u2019"
  sec: 819
  time: '13:39'
  who: Thom
- line: "When we talk about that 80% that we do on data munging and preparation, before\
    \ we get to the modeling phase in the development of the machine learning pipeline\
    \ \u2013 I would say 80% of the insights that you can get back to the business\
    \ come from that 80% at the machine learning preparation. For example, I may not\
    \ always use linear and logistic regression for my machine learning model that\
    \ goes into production, but I will always look at it. Why? Because it gives me\
    \ a great Pareto of feature importance. Well, wouldn't that be as important, maybe\
    \ more than predictions from a model?"
  who: Thom
- line: "I mean, yeah \u2013 you can react to predictions from a model. But you can\
    \ proact and understand what features are most important. You think of the wisdom\
    \ of the Gallup strength-finder poll \u2013 they're like, \u2018exploit your strengths\u2019\
    . Well, if we know this feature\u2019s most important business-wise, we can focus\
    \ on the variables coming in for that feature. How can we get that even stronger?\
    \ How can we get the variables more toward the positive end of that? Or maybe\
    \ there's a negative feature that's really strong. That's important knowledge\
    \ too. How can we reduce that so that we get the performance we want? But back\
    \ to Steve Blank. As you're developing your pipeline, I think (and I suck at this,\
    \ but I'm trying to get better at it) deliver crap. As fast as possible. Let me\
    \ say it again. Deliver crap as fast as possible."

- line: "OK. I have a term, but I'll modify it a little bit. Y'all will know the word\
    \ I would have used. I believe now in a \u2018crappy tracer bullet\u2019. That\
    \ means I want an end-to-end solution. It may not have all the features I wanted\
    \ to have, but I tested it end-to-end. I'm just making sure the end-to-end works.\
    \ Now I can build the thickness of that process and get all the features in it\
    \ that I wanted. But even before you get that end-to-end, if you get some insight\
    \ and you're doing customer-centric development \u2013 again, your customers can\
    \ be a combination of your domain experts and your business leaders \u2013 have\
    \ the spirit of getting frequent feedback during the course of your development."
  sec: 1016

  who: Thom
- line: "Now, here's the other part of getting a better return on data. You're marching\
    \ toward this, and you're helping the domain experts and the business leaders\
    \ understand what you're doing and why. But if you're really going to get a good\
    \ return on data, that collaboration needs to go both ways. You've been working\
    \ to understand their needs \u2013 they need to understand why you're doing your\
    \ processes and why they're important."
  who: Thom
- line: "Again, we're not asking them to become data scientists or data evangelists\
    \ themselves. We're saying, \u201CAppreciate what we're doing. Appreciate why\
    \ we're doing it.\u201D Because then our collaboration will be optimized. It'll\
    \ be much better, instead of you just saying \u201Cgo off and do this\u201D and\
    \ then we try to do it. No. There's so much more value in the actual process \u2013\
    \ to me understanding what's worrying you and you understanding why I'm serving\
    \ your questions, your needs, the way that I am."
  who: Thom
- line: "Let\u2019s see if I can summarize what you said. You said \u201CDeliver crap\
    \ as fast as possible.\u201D Then you show it to your end users \u2013 to the\
    \ business \u2013 and then you get feedback. So you really want to use this crappy\
    \ solution that you develop pretty fast to understand if this is serving their\
    \ needs. You want to get feedback from your users. You want to get insights from\
    \ your users. You learn a lot just by doing this. Right? So you don\u2019t put\
    \ a lot of time and effort into the development of your solution, but you're learning\
    \ from what you get as a result \u2013 from the feedback. And then you iterate.\

    \ that acronym, but\u2026 it's not a bad acronym, but just the spirit of \u201C\
    Yeah, we're getting the data.\u201D Well, was that very smooth? If it's not really\
    \ reliable and easy to do that, you need to go ask the organization, \u201CHey.\
    \ Just some constructive feedback \u2013 it would make it better for our ETL work\
    \ and my data science group if y'all could fix these things.\u201D Now we're marching\

    Oh. We don't like to do that.\u201D \u201CWell, it's costing us money. And let\
    \ me make the case. I would say, this is where we need to be the most adamant\
    \ \u2013 strong-arm it. Just say, \u201CNo, this is not good. Data is our platinum.\
    \ Data is our most valuable asset. You can't just willy-nilly allow people to\

    \u201D \u201CYeah, I could. But it's not going to help our modeling. It's not\
    \ going to help our data storytelling. Just make sure this field can\u2019t not\

    \ I think it belongs to everyone. If people are data literate, and they understand\
    \ the power of data \u2013 who is not going to care about clean data? People that\
    \ don't care about clean data are people that don't know how important data is.\
    \ How it affects the profits of the company. How it affects the decision-making\
    \ abilities of the company. So, data governance is everyone's responsibility.\
    \ A big part of that is making sure we have clean, complete data. Now we continue\
    \ down the pipeline. Hopefully, we've instigated \u2013 or initiated \u2013 some\
    \ better data collection practices. We might also realize, \u201CThis is data\
    \ we don't have. We need to start collecting.\u201D And so we get a collection\
    \ effort going. And I agree with you, Alexey \u2013 we really want to kind of\

    \ was trying to get at is \u2013 why can't we just experiment with these devices\
    \ that we own and just leased to the people? They're ours. We can do some small\
    \ factor analysis experiments with open stuff.\u201D He said, \u201CThom, I've\

    \ would have been far more productive. We could have had a lot of micro-meetings,\
    \ rather than me making the mistake of sending a formal email and CCing a lot\
    \ of stakeholders. No. Just try to be culturally savvy too. Make a lot of these\
    \ check-ins. You're frequently seeking feedback \u2013 make them very informal.\
    \ \u201CHey, I just want five minutes of your time. I want to show you something.\u201D\
    \ And then always ask for help, like, \u201CI think I can communicate this to\
    \ you in layman's terms. But I may fail to do that. So I need you to let me know\
    \ when you're not really getting it.\u201D That way, we're always in a continual\
    \ improvement mode on how we talk about data science to smart people that aren\u2019\
    t data scientists. But we're doing it in a very informal, frequent way."

    \ Say this.\u201D And then, \u201COkay, great. Thank you.\u201D \u201CYeah. You\
    \ know, the way you described that the other day \u2013 that was perfect. But\
    \ the way you described that last week, that was really hard for me to get. Let's\
    \ find a better way to do that.\u201D What I found, Alexey, when I do it this\
    \ way \u2013 where I've had those frequent check-ins with domain experts or business\
    \ leaders, once we get to the formal meeting, and someone's just got to ask the\
    \ challenging question to show off, I'm not the one answering those questions.\
    \ The people that I've been meeting with are defending everything I'm saying.\
    \ But it's because I've cared enough to say, \u201CI need your feedback. I need\
    \ you to affirm that I'm on the right track to serve the needs of the business\
    \ and to answer the questions that the domain expertise has.\u201D Where they're\
    \ weak in knowledge, I\u2019m trying to get it more data informed. So it's this\
    \ constant spirit of \u2013 do it frequently, but if you're doing it frequently\
    \ and formally, that's going to kill you. Do it frequently and informally. Lunch\
    \ and beer. That's my summary \u2013 lunch and beer."
