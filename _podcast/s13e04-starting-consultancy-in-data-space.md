short: Starting a Consultancy in the Data Space
title: Starting a Consultancy in the Data Space
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about starting and running a consultancy in the data
    space. We have a special guest today, Aleksander. Aleksander was a product manager
    at Delivery Hero. Then he became a co-founder and failed a few startups. Currently,
    he is running a data analytics agency in Berlin. He was also almost an archaeologist.
    I’m really curious to hear that story and we will probably hear about that a bit
    later. Welcome to the show!

  time: '1:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi! I'm very happy to be here.
  sec: 98
  time: '1:38'
  who: Aleksander
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks,
    Johanna, for your help.
  sec: 101
  time: '1:41'
  who: Alexey
- header: Aleksander’s background
- line: Before we start with our main topic of starting a data consultancy, let's
    start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
    And please mention the archaeologist part.
  sec: 107
  time: '1:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. I can start with that. Since I was six years old, I think, and
    up until I was 18 – if you asked me what I'm going to be doing in life, I would
    tell you, “I'm going to be an archaeologist.” I always loved history and geography.
    I was collecting dinosaurs and things like that. My entire educational path in
    high school skewed towards me going to study archaeology, etc. I applied and I
    even got admitted to two universities. Then that summer, I actually went and worked
    on an excavation site, to just get a feel of what it means to be an archaeologist.
  sec: 119
  time: '1:59'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Long story short, when I came back I decided I'm going to stick to the history
    books and documentaries so I went to study something else, which was political
    science and international business. That's my educational background. It's pretty
    much everything and nothing. [chuckles] After that I somehow managed to get into
    the startup ecommerce ecosystem in Warsaw. I even co-ran a startup on my own before
    I moved to Berlin, which is also a story. Then I moved to Berlin at the end of
    2014. I moved for a job, which was a product management position at Delivery Hero
    – one of the spin-offs at the time.
  sec: 119
  time: '1:59'
  who: Aleksander
- line: This is where I met Marco, who is my business partner, or “business better
    half”. We built pretty cool stuff during our Delivery Hero times together. In
    2019, we decided to quit and to do something on our own. We went through a few
    ideas for a product. That was always kind of the main goal – I wanted to build
    a product company. I did a bit of consulting in the data space in-between, to
    also get a feel for what problems there are. Then our main product that we built
    and tried to market was “data stack as a service,” which is an entire data pipeline
    from the ingestion to modeling and visualization, including the warehousing. That
    didn't pan out for various reasons and we decided to… [cross-talk]
  sec: 119
  time: '1:59'
  who: Aleksander
- line: I’m wondering why. I see a lot of startups who work in this area and some
    of them are doing fine.
  sec: 256
  time: '4:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, you have Y42, CleanAI – there are plenty of them – MotorData, Veldt.
    There are quite a few of them. We did a very extensive market validation of that
    idea. We believe that the market is not there for it – or the market is very,
    very small. Because essentially what you're selling is a technology – selling
    technology to tech people is very difficult because they will always think that
    they can build it faster and better themselves. Even with the tooling, if you
    look at the options that you have in the tooling landscape today, you can build
    a data stack in a day or two that's gonna do a decent enough job.
  sec: 265
  time: '4:25'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Can you actually build it or is this just what developers think?
  sec: 314
  time: '5:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, you stitch tools together, right? You take Airbyte, DBT, BigQuery
    or Snowflake or ClickHouse or whatever, and then you do transformations with DBT
    and you plug Metabase on top, and you're good to go. The real problem starts when
    you actually put data into it and you now need to map your business into the data
    model. And that's something that is very difficult to automate.
  sec: 320
  time: '5:20'
  who: Aleksander
- header: The difficulty of selling data stack as a service
- line: This is probably difficult for a startup that provides a data stack as a service.
    [Aleksander agrees] Because you only provide the stack and all the business knowledge
    – all the business transformation – happens after that.
  sec: 346
  time: '5:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. So if you are selling it to tech people, that's a very difficult
    sell. Then if you turn around and go to that with the business people – let's
    say you go to a CMO or a CFO or a CEO and you say, “Hey, look. I have this fantastic
    piece of technology that you can now use.” And they’re like, “Well, what do I
    do with it?” “Well, now you need a data analyst to actually run this.” “Okay,
    now you're selling me something that I need to not only pay for, but now you're
    telling you to hire someone to do my data for you. Then I’ll just hire the person
    to do the date for me. So what's the point of my paying?”
  sec: 360
  time: '6:00'
  who: Aleksander
- line: You would need to build it in a way where you also automate the modeling.
    Those also exist. I think there is a CLA that automates reporting for marketing,
    for instance. There are certain tools that automate reporting for finance. Basically,
    you go directly from the source to a report. That's valuable. Tech on its own
    is not really valuable. The real work goes into data modeling, because at the
    end of the day, you just need to map the business into the tables and entities.
  sec: 360
  time: '6:00'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Is this how you ended up doing consulting?
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. [chuckles]
  sec: 432
  time: '7:12'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Tell us about it. [chuckles]
  sec: 434
  time: '7:14'
  who: Alexey
- header: How Aleksander got into consulting
- line: Initially, we had a few other ideas about the product. The first one, we also
    validated very quickly and it just didn't make any sense. [chuckles] The idea
    was actually inspired by my inability to pull data from a SQL database back in
    the days of Delivery Hero and I would always bug Marco to do it for me. We validated
    that this is not something that would work. Product managers don't have that problem
    that much. As a community, they have bigger problems to solve first. And then
    we thought “Okay, so we already quit our jobs. What can we do? Okay, let's go
    to consulting to actually discover the problems in the data space.” And that's
    how we started.
  sec: 436
  time: '7:16'
  who: Aleksander
- line: While doing certain projects, gigs, etc., we discovered that, “Hey, maybe
    we can do the data stack as a service.” Whenever we would start a project, we
    very often just needed to build a data stack. It's repeatable work. So that's
    how it started. We actually found the first customer very, very quickly. From
    when we started searching for a first customer, it took us two weeks to land one
    and we had zero product. We had nothing. We basically sold an idea that we're
    gonna solve that problem. [cross-talk]
  sec: 436
  time: '7:16'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Was this the data stack idea, or the second one?
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was the data stack idea. We solved it without having a product and that
    actually led us to build up the wrong path going forward without getting too many
    results. So when we decided to stop doing that, we did a really extensive market
    validation on whether we can sell this, whether the market actually exists. We
    decided to go back to consulting and fully focus on that from then on.
  sec: 521
  time: '8:41'
  who: Aleksander
- header: The Mom Test – extracting feedback from people
- line: I’m wondering, how did it happen that you managed to sell an idea without
    having an actual implementation? Was it a part of your user research where you
    were reaching out to companies to understand what their problems are? And they
    were like, “Okay, yeah. We have this problem. Solve it for us.”
  sec: 548
  time: '9:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think this advice is applicable to any kind of business startup – any service
    that you want to provide or anything like that. Whatever you do, you really need
    to first see whether the problem that you're trying to solve exists and whether
    there are enough people to pay for it. So what we did is – I probably need to
    get royalties for this because I go around talking about this book a lot – the
    book is called The Mom Test. What the book allows you to do is validate a business
    idea without having anything – just by talking to people. The trick is that you
    never tell them what you're doing.
  sec: 566
  time: '9:26'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Because the moment you tell people what your idea is, they will lie to you
    because they want to be nice to you and because they know your ego is on the line.
    It gives very, very practical advice on how to talk to people and how to extract
    information so that you get very valuable feedback. You do 10-15 conversations
    like that and that will tell you a lot. Meanwhile, you didn't have to write a
    single line of code. So we were trying to do Mom tests. We were putting messages
    in various Slack communities, or different job boards, etc, we were trying to
    ping people directly.
  sec: 566
  time: '9:26'
  who: Aleksander
- line: We were just trying to talk to people about the problem of, “Is not having
    a technology that can process your data – is that a problem that hinders you from
    actually doing useful stuff with it?” And we offered free consulting for their
    time. You talk to us and then we will offer you free consulting in return so that
    the time is also worthwhile for you. We managed to find the person that was our
    first customer. We talked to them. It was the CTO of a company.
  sec: 566
  time: '9:26'
  who: Aleksander
- line: They're still our customer, because the product that we built still runs and
    our customer is still paying for it. At the end of the conversation, he simply
    asked us “Okay, we told you about our problems. Clearly this is a problem for
    us. What are you trying to do? What's in it for you?” And we just explained the
    idea that we had and he basically said, “You know what? Make an offer and you
    can build that for us. We will be your first customer.” So that's how we sold
    the first copy of something that does not exist yet.
  sec: 566
  time: '9:26'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So there is a book called The Mom Test. The book describes how to extract
    information from people – from user interviews – to really understand if the problem
    you're trying to solve exists and if people want to pay for solving this problem.
    You tried to do this Mom Test, you reached out to different people, and some of
    them were quite interested.
  sec: 726
  time: '12:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: In general, people will talk to you. People are generally willing to help.
    If they know that you're not trying to sell them something, they will be very
    keen. Because people love to talk about themselves – it's just human nature. So
    if you just know how to nudge and steer the conversation in the right direction,
    you can really learn a lot.
  sec: 751
  time: '12:31'
  who: Aleksander
- header: User interviews
- line: Can you maybe give us an example? How exactly does it work? Let's say you
    want to build a startup that sells data stack as a service. How do you approach
    these user interviews?
  sec: 773
  time: '12:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: You need fairly general leading questions at the beginning. For instance,
    if you're talking to a data analyst – because our initial target audience was
    data analysts – we knew that data analysts, at the time, very often don't really
    have enough technical skills to put together a stack like that. They keep extracting,
    they download the CSV from Salesforce, they have some Google Sheets, they copy
    and paste – there's a lot of manual work. It's prone to errors, etc. and they
    try to stitch things together and do analysis on top of that. If they would have
    a central place where all those sources are in, which is today's standard that's
    called the “modern data stack,” you can then run your SQL and you can build visualization,
    and you can help the business to answer business questions.
  sec: 787
  time: '13:07'
  who: Aleksander
- line: We would ask them, “Hey, what do you do all day? Where does your time go?”
    You start with that and you listen and tune in for little nuggets of, “Oh, maybe
    they have a problem here.” And then you dig deeper into that. You never ask questions
    like, “Would you buy this? Would you pay for this X?” Because if you ask someone
    very hypothetical questions, it’s like “If you give me this amazing piece of technology
    – yeah, I'll take it.” Or a question like, “Is this a problem to you?” Like, “Yes,
    it's a problem.” That's not useful information. People also like to complain.
  sec: 787
  time: '13:07'
  who: Aleksander
- line: If they tell you it's actually a problem, you still need to gauge how big
    that problem is. You ask them, “When was the last time it happened? If you don't
    solve it, what are the consequences? Is it just a mere inconvenience?” Because
    sometimes it's like, “Okay, whatever. I copy and paste this thing.” But if they
    tell you, “If I don't solve this, then potentially we're risking losing revenue.”
    Well, that's a big problem. Then you try to figure out how frequent the problem
    is, “Is this something that happens every day? Is it something that’s painful,
    but happens once every six months?” Then maybe it's not big enough. You're trying
    to extract very, very concrete examples of their workflow, where they suffer,
    and what the actual pain is.
  sec: 787
  time: '13:07'
  who: Aleksander
- line: How do you record them? I guess that you record the conversation during the
    interview, right? And then you somehow capture this in a bunch of Google Documents
    or something like that, right?
  sec: 943
  time: '15:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. These conversations are usually… we didn't record them. We will take
    notes. Whenever we could, it would be the two of us doing a call. It's actually
    very beneficial to do it in pairs. You don't want more than two people. Because
    if it's just one person that you're interviewing, then there are three people
    on the call (or in the room) and it might feel a bit overwhelming and stressful,
    so people won't open up that much, but two people is fine.
  sec: 955
  time: '15:55'
  who: Aleksander
- line: One person is responsible for asking the questions and nudging in the right
    direction, and the other person is responsible for taking the notes. The other
    person also needs to be kind of the guardian of the conversation. It's very easy
    to start pitching, especially when you already have something. And you never want
    to pitch them because the moment you reveal what you're doing – again, they're
    going to start lying to you. Some people are direct. Some people will tell you,
    “Well your product is stupid. It doesn't make any sense.”
  sec: 955
  time: '15:55'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Most don't, right?
  sec: 1030
  time: '17:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: But most don't. Exactly. And you can't have 1000 conversations with the hope
    that you're going to land 10 people that are super honest with you. So you want
    to avoid pitching as much as possible. Basically, the other person's job is to
    also make sure that whoever is asking questions doesn't get too excited and jump
    ahead with pitching too early.
  sec: 1032
  time: '17:12'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Your background is in product management, archaeology aside. [Aleksander chuckles]
    What is Marco’s background?
  sec: 1058
  time: '17:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Marco is a software engineer.
  sec: 1067
  time: '17:47'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Software engineer. Okay. I guess it was the two of you – you and Marco – who
    were doing the interviews. So how did you split these responsibilities? Who was
    taking notes? Who was asking questions?
  sec: 1068
  time: '17:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends. We could switch.
  sec: 1079
  time: '17:59'
  who: Aleksander
- header: Why Aleksander’s data stack as a service startup was not viable
- line: Oh, so you could do both. [Aleksander agrees] Interesting. So you did these
    10-15 conversations following the Mom Test and then at the end found out that
    the problem is not big enough?
  sec: 1081
  time: '18:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. First off, the mistake that we made was that we sold it without having
    it – which is an ideal scenario. If someone is taking out their credit card and
    telling you, “Yeah, I'm gonna buy this without you having anything at all.” That's
    a great signal. You just need to have enough people that will do that. [chuckles]
    We got excited, we went and built it, we launched it, we did everything, etc.
    We helped with setting it up, with the models, and with setting up the Metabase.
    They already had Metabase, so we transferred some of the reports onto the modeling
    layer so that they were faster – so that they actually run. I was like, “Well,
    if we can find a customer in two weeks without having it, we shouldn't just go
    out and spam everyone. We’re sitting on a goldmine, right?”
  sec: 1098
  time: '18:18'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Was this the case?
  sec: 1161
  time: '19:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. It wasn't. We spent a good few months trying to acquire the next customers
    and it never happened. That's when we were like, “Hang on. Maybe we were trying
    to run before we could walk. Let's go back to validate.” And we went back to validate
    and we managed to line up I think 15 people that could be potential customers.
    Then after talking to them, doing the proper monitors, etc it became kind of obvious
    that it's just not there. I mean, this product makes sense. It makes sense and
    there are companies that will use it. It's just that I don't think there are enough
    people – enough companies where it makes sense – or that the lifecycle is long
    enough.
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Aleksander
- line: You sacrifice a certain degree of flexibility with products like that. It's
    a black box. You don't know what it is. You can either build it in an opinionated
    way or you build it in an open way. But in an open way, it's either open source,
    or there are different pieces of it, like ingestion, transformation, etc. Also,
    making compromises is very difficult. You can’t have it be inflexible, yet allow
    for certain changes. That's just very technically challenging to actually build.
    So you need to pick. And if you're picking it as “This is what it is. This is
    a black box. You don't really ever know how it works.” People don't like that.
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Aleksander
- line: We talked to some of the customers of our competitors and there is something
    to be said. If your team is a little bit more junior, then this provides certain
    guide rails and they cannot mess up too much. I mean, they can still mess up models,
    but you can always mess up models. So having that kind of rigid structure can
    basically make up for certain mistakes that less experienced people make while
    working on the pipelines.
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Aleksander
- line: This client of yours that you landed while conducting this Mom Test – they
    were interested in the product that you wanted to build, but then you kind of
    ended up consulting them, right? You said, “Let's build this thing for you.”
  sec: 1299
  time: '21:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Because what they really wanted, and what the real benefit was –
    it was the free consulting that they got out of it when we were actually building
    it. We built their models. We went and built their modeling layer. It was in our
    tool, obviously, but we wrote the SQL. And that's the real value. We went and
    we understood their business and translated it into SQL models. That was the real
    value – not the shell that would run it. It took us a while to realize that, actually,
    because we were excited that someone is actually willing to pay for the product
    that we bought. [chuckles] That can lead you down the wrong path.
  sec: 1316
  time: '21:56'
  who: Aleksander
- header: How Aleksander decided to switch to consulting
- line: How did you realize that building these models is what you want to do and
    that you and Marco want to start this consultancy company?
  sec: 1362
  time: '22:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's where the value is. When you're working with the data, to us, it’s bridging
    the gap between the business and whatever is hidden in the data that you collect.
    First and foremost, you start with that. Someone has a business question they
    need to make a decision, you start with that. You spent time understanding what
    it is. It's a lot of talking to your stakeholders. There's a lot of product work
    there. I always say that – there's so much overlap between the product managers’
    job and data analysts’ job, because data teams don't usually have product managers.
    Some bigger ones and bigger companies, of course, do. But most of the teams don't
    have that luxury. So someone needs to go into that work.
  sec: 1370
  time: '22:50'
  who: Aleksander
- line: At the end of the day, data teams –it's an internal product. If you're talking
    about business intelligence, it's an internal product. You are serving your internal
    customers and they work in other teams. This is where the value is, and this is
    what's difficult. There are a lot of toys now, we have ChatGPT now and there's
    a lot of talk about data science, etc. A lot of companies can do without it. A
    lot of companies don't have the data and they need help with basic things. The
    basic things take them 80% of the way. And once you get that 80% of the way, then
    you can start thinking “Okay, how do I optimize the 2%, the next 3%, the next…?”
  sec: 1370
  time: '22:50'
  who: Aleksander
- line: This is where machine learning and this is where data science really comes
    into play, and really can be valuable. But at the beginning… and we're talking
    here about medium-sized companies, we're talking about startups, post-seed, pre-series
    A, series A – that kind of level, unless your value proposition requires AI and
    requires machine learning. That's a different story. Then you really need to invest
    from the get-go, because otherwise you don't have a value proposition. But when
    you're talking about analyzing the business, understanding how the business is
    doing, and predicting how the business can be doing, there's a lot of very simple
    and pragmatic and very often boring things that you can do that do not require
    a lot of effort. But to dig this out, you really need to understand what is needed
    and that's the difficult part.
  sec: 1370
  time: '22:50'
  who: Aleksander
- line: I want to ask you about these simple, pragmatic, and boring things. But maybe
    before that, I’m curious. Why is it called consulting? Do you just go there, ask
    questions, or are you hands-on?
  sec: 1545
  time: '25:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, we are hands-on. We are implementing things. Consulting can have a very,
    very negative connotation. Let's be upfront about it. You pay consultants, they
    come in, they tell you what to do, and they go away. They give you their invoice
    and wash their hands of the consequences or the results. No, we implement things.
    We basically go in and we will try to figure out what's needed, and then we will
    implement those things. We take full accountability for if it works or not, obviously.
    I mean, in a nutshell. [chuckles]
  sec: 1563
  time: '26:03'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So why is it called consulting? To me, consulting is actually – a company
    has a question and then they need to consult somebody on solving the question.
    They consult, they get input, and then they go implement it. I guess this is like
    the classical definition.
  sec: 1604
  time: '26:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, this is a good question. Why is it called consulting? That's what it
    means – you consult someone if you have a problem and they basically get you unstuck.
    But we're also talking about implementing things. I don't know.

    do.
  sec: 1636
  time: '27:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's just a subgroup of consulting? A type of consulting? Probably.
    But yeah. Very often, I laugh about the fact that you're being paid to comment,
    advise, and then implement what people need, but very often, you end up just implementing
    what people want. There is a limited amount of influence you can actually have
    and exerting influence, sometimes it's just difficult. It really depends on the
    client.
  sec: 1639
  time: '27:19'
  who: Aleksander
- header: Finding clients to consult
- line: First, let me ask you about how you find these clients. You said that your
    clients are usually startups – pre-seed startups or series A startups – that do
    not necessarily have this data infrastructure. In order to do cool things in the
    future, they need to get the basics first. So how do you find these companies?
    Where do you find them? Do you open TechCrunch or something like that?
  sec: 1679
  time: '27:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. [chuckles] It's a little bit different. Consulting or freelancing or contractual-based
    work – because, at the end of the day, we're external partners, external providers,
    or external contractors – it's very much a network-based business. But you cannot
    just wait until your network gives gigs. You need to help it a little bit. Getting
    the first projects is usually the most difficult part.
  sec: 1713
  time: '28:33'
  who: Aleksander
- line: For you, it wasn't that difficult, right?
  sec: 1754
  time: '29:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: When we switched to consulting, it's a little bit different. We would tell
    people, “Hey, we’re doing consulting now.” You reach out to your network first
    – that's what you do. This is the first step. Basically, you let people who you
    think can introduce you to potential clients or could have worked for you. You
    build up a network and people may go work for different companies – maybe they
    need help as well. So you do that first and let people know that you are looking.
    You need to think about, “What is my positioning? Who is actually my target customer?”
    You need to explain to others what you're doing, even if it's just consulting,
    it can have many shapes and forms. So you need to think about that and reach out
    to them. That's step number one. But again… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1758

- header: Figuring out how to position your services
- line: How would you actually do this? It sounds easy, right? You're just like, “Okay.
    Who is my target audience? How do we position ourselves?” It seems simple. But
    when you actually start, it's not easy, right? How do you actually do this? Mom
    Test?
  sec: 1817
  time: '30:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: We struggle. Basically, we experiment. We see what lands – what strikes a
    chord on the other side. You always start with, “Okay. Who do I want to work with?”
    Even now, we are experimenting with how we position ourselves. For instance, back
    when we were starting, we thought, “We’re the guys who will come in and build
    your first data warehouse, or first reports, models, etc.” That's what we were
    doing. We knew which moment in the lifecycle of a company where this becomes helpful
    and actually makes sense.
  sec: 1837
  time: '30:37'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Because you shouldn't build your data warehouse too fast – there is a point
    in time where that makes sense. At the beginning of the company, it just simply
    doesn't. So we knew which kind of companies we should go for. These were around
    series A startups. If we're doing things, this is where you're getting your product
    market fit, so this is where you're going to start scaling. And that's something
    that is really useful – when you more or less already know what you're doing and
    you just need to do more of it. You're getting out of the experimentation phase.
    This is where… [cross-talk]

    Berlin or you just targeted everyone?
  sec: 1919
  time: '31:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Europe – as we're in more or less the same time zone. Working with companies
    in California would have been difficult. Also, we don't have a footprint there.
    We don't have a network. Our competition is always local. You can go global, but
    when you want to grow to a certain size it probably makes sense to expand. We
    would talk to VCs – we know a few VCs, etc. – “Hey, does anyone from your portfolio
    companies need help?” You think about which people can help you earn the clients.
    I just want to go back to positioning because that was your question. You need
    to think about, “Who is your customer?” And “What is the value proposition? What
    are you offering them?” Even in the data field, it can be so many things.
  sec: 1925
  time: '32:05'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Now we're trying to say, “We are on demand data analysts. We work directly
    with the business. We can help you optimize your revenue. We can help you optimize
    your marketing spend. Maybe there is some kind of risk that you have in the company
    and you want to mute that risk. Maybe you want to know who your customers are.
    Maybe you want to do some kind of segmentation.” We start with a business opportunity
    or a business problem. Yes, we can build the infrastructure. We have full stack
    capabilities, between the two of us. It's a blessing and a curse, because we can
    literally do anything. We have product skills. The both of us have data analytics
    skills. And then Marco has the engineering skills. So we can really do a lot.
  sec: 1925
  time: '32:05'
  who: Aleksander
- line: But you can't just tell people, “Oh, I'm doing everything!” Then you’re probably
    doing nothing. You need to think about what you want to offer. You can say, “You
    know what? I'm a data scientist or I'm a data engineer. I'm gonna partner up with
    someone and we're just gonna hit up the companies that already have big teams.
    They just need hands-on support on certain projects.” You can do that. That's
    the positioning. It just comes down to what you can do, what you can do well,
    and who you can help. It's difficult. You have to choose the right words.
  sec: 1925
  time: '32:05'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So first, you think about “What do I want to do? (If I'm a data scientist)
    I want to help companies who already have a data science team, but maybe they're
    short on people. I can go there and help with their existing projects. Or I can
    target companies who do not have any data infrastructure, but they want to do
    some data stuff in the future.” First, you need to define who your target customer
    is, and then once you define that, you need to come to them and tell them why
    they should hire you. In your case, they probably have some business problems
    or things they want to solve like, “Who are our customers?”
  sec: 2082
  time: '34:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe they need segmentation or optimize their spending on marketing. I guess,
    in this case, you need to know the domain in which they work a little bit? Then
    you can speak the same language with them. You can already suggest some things.
    This is your messaging. This is your target customer. You already have some problems
    in mind that you can solve for them. This is what you pitch. If they like you,
    they hire you – if they don't, you keep iterating on your messaging, right?
  sec: 2082
  time: '34:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, yes. Essentially, you can keep iterating on your messaging. You can
    also keep iterating on your positioning. As I said, “What is your value proposition?”
  sec: 2163
  time: '36:03'
  who: Aleksander
- header: Figuring out your target audience
- line: What is that? In these two things – the first is the target customer, and
    then there’s the thing that you can solve for them. Is positioning related to
    the first one or the second or both?
  sec: 2180
  time: '36:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's related to both. It includes who your customer is and what your offering
    is. From that, you can figure out “Okay, where do these people hang out? Where
    do I find them? Who do I know that can introduce me to those people? How do I
    want to structure my messaging around that?” That's part of positioning as well.
  sec: 2193
  time: '36:33'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Can you give an example of this messaging? Maybe this is what you’re suggesting
    to your customers right now? Maybe you can give an example of that?
  sec: 2223
  time: '37:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. For instance let's say we're on demand data analysts. That's
    still very broad. Data analysts can do a lot of things. So what can you help me
    with specifically? If we're talking to a CFO, you can say, “Look, we can help
    you optimize your revenue. These are tight times. Especially if we're talking
    about VC-backed startups, investors are looking at their PMLs with more scrutiny
    right now. Let us help you find opportunities to either reduce your spend or to
    increase your revenue. If you need to optimize how much you're spending on marketing,
    let us help you with that. We can figure out your tracking. We can try to optimize
    where your marketing spend should be going – how you calculate your return on
    investment, etc. We can do something around attribution.” It really depends on
    who you're talking to and the problems that they have.
  sec: 2233
  time: '37:13'
  who: Aleksander
- line: I guess you need to do a bit of homework, right? Before you speak with a customer,
    you want to understand, “Okay, they're in this particular market segment. They
    probably have this, this, and this problem.” Then you go to a meeting with them
    and you say, “This is what we can help with.” You start talking with them, and
    while talking you realize that maybe the problem is not what you wanted to suggest,
    but something related. While talking, you figure this out.
  sec: 2302
  time: '38:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Going back to how you acquire the customer. That is relevant to, again,
    the positioning, etc. Right now, we're testing a few things. Last year was fantastic.
    Last year, we were rejecting projects, because we just did not have capacity.
    And last year was still a year where there was a lot of VC money and people were
    still hiring. At the end of the year, we saw a lot of layoffs in various companies.
    That also includes people in the data industry. Because of that, there was an
    influx of people into the market. Yes, there were layoffs, but there were still
    a lot of companies that were hiring. You could still find a job. The competition
    on the market became bigger when you were a job seeker, but there were still companies
    that were hiring. Those companies that have the budgets and where problems need
    solving, six months ago they could not hire.
  sec: 2327
  time: '38:47'
  who: Aleksander
- line: This is where an external contractor becomes very attractive because you can
    have that person tomorrow. Trying to poach and things like that – there was just
    not enough supply for the demand. Now the demand is much smaller and supply has
    increased. Therefore, the companies that were cutting budgets, maybe taking contractors
    doesn't make much sense. However, it actually might, in some cases. People still
    have certain needs to be fulfilled – they can just hire easily now, and probably
    cheaper because the salaries are also inflated. Now we're probably going to see
    that the market is shifting towards the employer market.

  sec: 2450
  time: '40:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's tougher, yes. One of the cons of doing this is that there is
    uncertainty. Yesterday, today, you have projects – tomorrow you might not have
    them. Essentially, it is up to you to find work. But yeah, I believe that it's
    possible. We do have a little bit of work. We have been talking to people. We
    have leads. People still need support. But this is where you position yourself
    and things like that become crucial. You rely on certain uncertain distribution
    channels, let’s call them that, and it's not like they are super repeatable. You
    can't just say, “I'm going to spend money here and I know I'm going to get clients.”
    It doesn't work like that. I mean, you can do it with outbound sales, but if you're
    small, that might not necessarily make a lot of sense.
  sec: 2455
  time: '40:55'
  who: Aleksander
- line: You network – you message people, you talk to them, you wait. We do content.
    LinkedIn works, actually. It's very interesting. If you put yourself out there
    with a very constant messaging that relates with your target audience, we've seen
    that people actually reach out to you to solve their problems. That's why it's
    important to play around with the message and then build the content that you
    produce around that. [cross-talk]
  sec: 2455
  time: '40:55'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Katya, who put us in touch says exactly the same thing. By the way, if you're
    listening to us right now – Hi, thanks for putting us together. I think she mentioned
    what you’re saying as well.
  sec: 2544
  time: '42:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: We know this from her. We collaborate on a few things. That's why messaging
    is important. Content, in general, works. We also had people getting in touch
    with us in the past because someone saw a blog post that we wrote and then someone
    asked that person if they knew anyone and that person replied “I actually read
    a blog post. You know what? Go talk to these guys. Maybe they can help you.” It’s
    just that building this up takes time. But in the long run, it pays off. You do
    those things – you do all of them – and it all compounds. That's how to build
    a stable engine to be able to talk to people.
  sec: 2555
  time: '42:35'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So you need a network and with the network, you get referrals. Happy clients
    refer other clients. But you also need other sources of leads. One of these sources
    is content. Content could be, as you mentioned, LinkedIn posts. You post messages
    targeted at your ideal customers – your target customers. Then you also write
    blog posts that are also targeted at these customers. By the way, do you make
    these posts yourself? Or do you have some sort of content manager? How do you
    do this?
  sec: 2601
  time: '43:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, at the moment we make them ourselves. When we started writing blog posts,
    we worked with a freelance editor who would help us. Writing is difficult – it's
    a skill on its own.
  sec: 2640
  time: '44:00'
  who: Aleksander
- line: I guess for you, as a product manager, it's easier because… [Aleksander disagrees]
    No? [Aleksander laughs] For software engineers it's probably harder than PMs.
  sec: 2657
  time: '44:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's a skill. If you're not doing it on a regular basis it's… it has rules
    that you need to follow. There's a lot of things to consider. So we worked with
    someone that would help us structure the articles, read through them, proofread
    them, point out mistakes etc. That helps because you learn from that person as
    well. You get tips. You talk to that person, who says, “Hey, maybe you should
    structure that in a different way.” The person that you work with doesn't need
    to know anything about what you're doing. You need to explain. Today, we still
    write our own content. I like writing my own content because it allows me to also
    express who I am. It's mine. So it's kind of important to me that I write that.

    first client?”

  who: Aleksander
- line: For those who listen to this without the video, what did you just do?
  sec: 2739
  time: '45:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was a more or less random number. Sorry, it wasn't random. It was a number,
    it was not random. We looked at what competitors are charging. The way you need
    to think about this is – you want to base your pricing based on value. You don't
    base a pricing of something based on what it costs you to produce it. That's the
    first thing. If you're trying to design a product or a service, that’s the first
    thing you need to understand – the service does not cost the client or customer
    the price that’s based on the “manufacturing costs”. It's based on the value that
    whatever you're doing is providing. Our thinking was more or less along those
    lines.
  sec: 2744
  time: '45:44'
  who: Aleksander
- line: We tried to enable data analysts. At the time, hiring data engineers was extremely
    difficult because these were the times that data engineering was so hot that everyone
    wanted to hire one. I even did benchmarking and I did some LinkedIn searches to
    just quantify how many jobs are out there versus how many people there are with
    that title. The gap was massive. In Europe, it was 100% and in the States it was
    like 200%. In the US, even if everyone quit, or was fired, or was poached, and
    switched jobs, the gap would still exist, which is ridiculous. So, “A data engineer
    costs X, I'm saving you the full-time hire.” The service, obviously, needs to
    be cheaper than a full-time hire. That's the rule of thumb.
  sec: 2744
  time: '45:44'
  who: Aleksander
- line: “Cheaper” in what sense? I’m guessing that you, as a consultant, need to charge
    a bit more than, let's say, a month of a data engineer’s work.
  sec: 2853
  time: '47:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, sorry. I was referring to selling a product. You ballpark, “Okay, maybe
    it should be this.” And then you say, “Okay, what is the competition charging?”
    At the beginning, getting the pricing rate is not that crucial. At the beginning
    it is more important to see if whatever I'm selling sells and people are willing
    to pay for it, then you will have to change your pricing on the way, once you
    get more data points on what works and what doesn't – when you learn what the
    value is that you provide. For consulting, the way we look at this is, although
    we charge daily rates, it's also not that someone is just paying us for our time.
    Someone is paying us for the fact that we've seen things multiple times and we
    will be able to tell people and navigate a situation that they have never seen
    before but we did.
  sec: 2862
  time: '47:42'
  who: Aleksander
- line: That's why the pricing is based on that. The other thing is, when you're hiring
    externally – we can be fired at will. Tomorrow, you can tell us “We don't want
    to work together.” And that's perfectly fine. That's where that premium goes as
    well. For us, we compensate for that. We're not full time employees. Especially
    in Germany, when you pass the probation period, it’s very difficult to let people
    go. So you need to include that. That's why you pay the premium on that.
  sec: 2862
  time: '47:42'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Is there any rule of thumb for that? Let's say, “Take the salary of a senior
    data analyst and multiply it by two,” or something like that?
  sec: 2958
  time: '49:18'

    rate is.
  sec: 2968
  time: '49:28'

    consultants charge?
  sec: 2975
  time: '49:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. We talk to each other. The community is there and we talk to each other.
    With the ones that we know, at least we kind of know what the ballpark pricing
    is and what everyone charges. And that's okay. When we first started, we had one
    of the first clients – it was a person that we knew. He was also giving us advice
    on startups and how to build a company, etc. He actually had experience consulting
    as well. We quoted him and he goes, “So how much do you charge?” And we said,
    “Okay, we want this.” He looked at us and said, “You know what? I'm very happy
    to take that price. Next time you do this, double it.”

  sec: 3033
  time: '50:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. For the next clients, yeah. The other thing that is really good to think
    about is – figure out what your maximum is. What is your starting rate? What is
    the ideal that you want to charge? Obviously, it cannot be ridiculous. You can’t
    say, “I'm gonna charge 1000 per hour,” that's just not gonna fly. It's impossible.
    But you need to figure out. [cross-talk]

  sec: 3081
  time: '51:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that would be the ballpark. And that depends on what kind of work you're
    doing and how long the collaboration with the client is going to last. So this
    is your starting rate and then you also need to think about the absolute bare
    minimum that you are willing to take the job for. This is useful because when
    someone asks you about the price, and even if it's a friendly company owner –
    someone that comes from the network or from close friends or whatever – and they
    ask you, “Please make me a good deal.” Never, ever start with a good deal. Because
    no matter what you quote, people try to bring it down. We made that mistake a
    few times.

- line: With the daily price – I have no experience in consulting, just something
    that's on my mind – you have this incentive to work for more days. So instead
    of thinking about, “What is the most effective way to solve the problem and have
    a solution?” You start thinking about these days like, “Okay, I need six months
    for that. This is how much it will cost.” Right? You kind of create the incentive
    (that maybe you don't even realize because it's our internal bias) to work more.
    [cross-talk]
  sec: 3158
  time: '52:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. This is an excellent question. You’re right – there is an incentive to
    work more days. I'm being very honest, we really try not to do it. We try to be
    really honest and say, “This will take X days. Maybe it will take more, maybe
    it will take less.” Our incentive is, at the end of day we want to help. There's
    also a very big incentive for you to do a good job and for the clients to be happy.
    Because if the client is happy… [cross-talk]

  who: Aleksander

  sec: 3234
  time: '53:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Because if the client is not happy, they're not gonna refer. This
    is a small world. Everyone knows each other, especially in the startup ecosystem
    in Germany, and even in Europe, in general. People talk. The fact that you didn't
    do a very good job, people are going to hear about it and you don't want that.
    You want them to be happy. You want them to refer you. Because no one goes into
    Google search (or these days, Bing, since Bing is a thing again) and says “Okay,
    I need data consultants. Who are they?” No, you go to someone that you know and
    ask, “Hey, do you know them?” That's how this search happens. So you want happy
    clients.
  sec: 3235

    inexperience or the fact that they don't know how certain things work or they
    don't know the tech or they don't know how long it's gonna take – it's gonna bite
    you at some point. So there's incentive to avoid that and there's incentive to
    be honest and actually helpful to your customers. Then there is another thing
    – you can turn around and say, “Okay, let's charge for a project.” The problem
    with that is, in general, it's very impossible to know what a deliverable should
    cost because you don't know how much it's going to take before you actually start
    doing it.

    where you deliver and you shake hands you part ways. [Aleksander agrees] You would
    always need to make a few iterations.

- line: If there is manual work involved – and you can automate certain things, that's
    obviously possible. You can build tools for yourself and make your next project
    easier if it's the same type of a project. The main effort that we put into our
    projects really goes into data modeling and that mapping of the business into
    SQL tables and business entities, etc. so that you can actually make this useful
    for the rest of the company. You don't know how much time it's going to take.
    You can ballpark things, of course. If you have one source, it's probably going
    to be easier. You just need to figure out that one source, right?

    you're an e-commerce business or delivery company, when I look at it, I will know
    what I'm looking at because it's not the first time I'm looking at it.” But there'll
    still be bugs. There'll still be weird things that I will need to go and figure
    out. I still need to talk to stakeholders, and some of them are not super available,
    because they're also busy people, so you might be rescheduling things. You need
    to get a feel for how the stakeholders like to be communicated with. You need
    to get a feel “Okay, how do I get the information that I need from those people?
    There's always that kind of uncertainty, because you never know what you’ll discover.

- line: It's impossible to project how much something should cost based on the effort
    that is going to go into it because you just don't know. Then at some point, if
    you do these projects, there's always one side that is unhappy – either it took
    less time because it's possible. It's very variable that you discover “Ah, it’s
    super easy. I will solve it in a week.” And we're charging something like for
    a month of work. Then the client will be unhappy because now the client thinks
    they're being overcharged. Or you spend significantly more time on it and then
    it's just unprofitable for you.

- line: We don't have a lot of time so maybe I'll ask a very quick question with a
    yes or no answer. Is Germany a good country to register a consultancy company?
  sec: 3478
  time: '57:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Yes and no. As a good consultant would say, the answer is yes and
    no. If you want to primarily target German small/medium-sized companies or German
    enterprises, then yes, Germany is a good place to found a company. Because those
    clients will treat you seriously or actually will consider you at all, if you
    have a company in Germany. Ideally, that company is GmbH, which is a complex form
    of incorporation, especially in Germany.'

- line: If you don't care where your customers are, like in Europe, or your customers
    are primarily startups, then you can consider other countries. You can do it in
    the Netherlands, which is very easy. You can do most of it online. It's very quick.
    Everything is in English. You can consider Estonia because then it's just simplicity.
    Doing it in Germany has a certain amount of bureaucracy that comes with it, which
    we learned the hard way.

    to our listeners?

- line: Other than The Mom Test? Yes. There is one that is very interesting that is
    called Think Like a Rocket Scientist. And it's written by an actual rocket scientist.
    The guy was working for NASA and he was working on the operational team that was
    sending things to Mars. Basically it deconstructs a way of how you approach projects
    and how you should be thinking about projects. There's a lot of overlap with how
    you build software, “You should test. You should test. etc.” But it basically
    breaks down how you should start with your problem or the big idea and then kind
    of reverse engineer and formulate a plan from the top down, rather than just trying
    things randomly. It's written in a very easy way and there are really cool examples
    and real stories from space missions and how NASA screws things up. It's an easy
    light read but there’s actually a lot of good advice. If you don't have extensive
    experience in the product management field – because I do those things on autopilot
    now – but it actually teaches you the kind of thinking that is needed. Starting
    a company is a project. How would you go about that? There is a lot of good advice
    there.

    joining us today and for sharing your knowledge, expertise, and everything you
    learned from your experience of starting a consultancy company. Thanks, everyone
    for joining us today, for listening in and for asking questions. Have a great
