transcript:
- header: 'Guest Overview: Swyx and the learn in public movement'
- line: This week we will talk about marketing ourselves. We have a special guest
    today, Swyx aka Swyx. Shawn is a developer, PM and angel investor, who is active
    in the development community. He is a frequent speaker and writer. I bet you already
    know him from his “learn in public” movement that he advocates. Welcome! Thanks
    for coming today.
  sec: 69
  time: '1:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks for having me. I have been hanging out in the DataTalks slack. I have
    been getting a lot of questions on the book. It’s been really great — sharing
    thoughts on these things. I don’t think we discuss this stuff enough as developers.
    It’s soft but it’s as important as coding.
  sec: 106
  time: '1:46'
  who: Swyx
- line: I agree. That’s why I thought it’s a really great idea to reach out to you.
    I was very happy when you said that you want to join our podcast. But before we
    go into our main topic of marketing ourselves, let’s start with your background.
    Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 123
  time: '2:03'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Journey: finance to coding, Netlify, AWS, Temporal'
- line: I am originally from Singapore. I moved to the States for college. My first
    career was in finance. I did everything from central banking to investment banking
    to hedge funds. If anyone is familiar with the finance industry — that is a grand
    tour of everything there is to do in the finance industry. To level up in finance,
    you learn to code — in order to run quantitative models and risk management and
    pricing and all that. That’s what I did. I realized that was something I wanted
    to do and was better at than the finance part.
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Swyx
- line: I did a career switch at age 30 and started over as a junior. I went to a
    bootcamp, did freecodecamp and worked my way through the ranks. I joined 2-sigma
    as a front-end engineer, then I got noticed by Netlify. That is when I started
    really doing the learn-in-public stuff. New York City was just a really good place
    to do speaking. I started blogging about reacts as well. I worked at Netlify for
    two years. Then I joined AWS. I recently left AWS to be head of developer experience
    at Temporal.io.
  who: Swyx
- line: Last year I wrote down a book of career advice. As much as my writing on React
    and Svelte and JavaScript has been popular, the most popular stuff has been the
    non-technical stuff. I decided to write down everything that I have absorbed.
    I have resources that I collect — I am a part of “building a second brain” movement.
    I have my second brain. “The coding career handbook” is my second brain of 1500
    links, resources, tweets and advice that I have collected from other people. I
    am not the authority, but I borrowed authority from other people. It was a good
    exercise to write. It resonated with a lot of people. People are learning how
    to code, cracking the interview, then they get past the interview, they get the
    job and then they are like “now what?” There is a huge gap between that and being
    a senior. Everyone only wants to hire seniors. My goal is to help people level
    up from junior to senior.
  who: Swyx
- line: I work at developer relations. This topic of marketing is a big one for people.
    According to a survey that I saw, most developers understand that there is some
    value to marketing. They just don’t see themselves doing it. They see other people
    doing it. They see it, they are like “This person is already internet famous.
    That is not for me”. A part of what I am trying to do here is to dispel that notion
    that you have to be internet famous. There is some level of self-marketing that
    you should do, otherwise people are not going to know what you did or how good
    you are.
  who: Swyx
- line: Interesting! You started in finance, you worked as quantitative analytics.
    And you also now join Temporal.io which is a data processing company. You are
    a lot closer to data than I thought.
  sec: 341
  time: '5:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: I work on the front end of that company. I don’t know all the details. But
    yes, it can be used for data. We are not focused on just data, but we can talk
    about that when the time comes.
  sec: 358
  time: '5:58'
  who: Swyx
- header: 'Why Self‑Marketing Matters: recognition, promotions, opportunities'
- line: About marketing ourselves. You are one of the people I follow on Twitter for
    stuff like marketing ourselves and learning in public. So I wanted to ask you,
    why should we market ourselves? Why is it important for our careers? You have
    touched it a bit, but maybe we can expand it.
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are a lot of whys. It’s very personal. Why do you do what you do? It’s
    very different from why I do what I do. There is part of it which is getting recognition
    for your skills and your work. If you ever wondered, why did you not get that
    promotion? Why someone else, who seems to know less than you, seems to do better
    as a career? It’s perhaps because they are marketing themselves better than you
    are. That’s an easy thing to fix — the hard thing is actually doing stuff. I want
    people, who have the quality and have the genuine skill, to be able to represent
    themselves better, so that they can get in front of the right opportunities and
    the right employers and do better for themselves.
  sec: 403
  time: '6:43'
  who: Swyx
- line: If you don’t market yourself, then other people, who are less shy about it,
    will put themselves out there. They will get those opportunities. Maybe they wouldn’t
    do as good of a job as you might. That’s ultimately the breakdown. At a bare minimum,
    when you market yourself well, you get more money — more lifetime opportunities
    that translate into earnings. That’s a fundamental motivator for anyone.
  who: Swyx
- line: Like for a company who cares about some internal KPIs, at the end, what they
    care about is profit, right?
  sec: 501
  time: '8:21'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Marketing Beyond Job Hunting: open source and internal persuasion'
- line: I don’t want to make it too commercial. When you create an open source project
    and you want people to use your stuff for free, you still have to market your
    project. That’s a similar skill. Or whenever you are trying to push an idea that
    you want to promote within the company. Let’s say you want to switch to this other
    tech stack or you have this feature idea, you have to market that idea.
  sec: 513
  time: '8:33'
  who: Swyx
- line: These are all parts of marketing yourself. They will be affected by your credibility,
    but also your ability to market that idea. These are all related skills that you
    should practice and compound through the rest of your life.
  who: Swyx
- line: We want to do this because we want to get more recognition. We want to get
    more recognition because we want to be promoted. We have the technical skills,
    but for people in tech, myself included, it’s easier to code rather than go and
    stay in front of people. Even just tweeting is also difficult. You can start thinking
    “what people will think about me”. But compared to what we are doing as developers,
    this is a lot easier, it’s only 280 characters. It’s easier than writing a big
    system. We should use this opportunity and then get that promotion or get a better
    job or get recognition. And if you are an open source author, people will find
    your library. Right?
  sec: 560
  time: '9:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes sir. Exactly!
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Swyx
- header: 'Personal Marketing Framework: brand, domain, value, skills, channel'
- line: Let’s say I want to become better. I want to get recognition outside of my
    company. I know how to code. I am relatively good at this, maybe better than some
    of my colleagues, and worse than some others. I’m an average developer. What do
    I need to do to be better at personal marketing? What do I need to do?
  sec: 626
  time: '10:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: That is a very broad question. When I wrote my book, I published a chapter
    from there for free. It was part of marketing for the book. This is very meta
    — writing about marketing while marketing. There is a graphic where I break down
    marketing in terms of personal branding, the domain that you pick, the business
    value that you can deliver, the tech skills that you have and the channel which
    you are delivering to — whether you are talking about public marketing or internal
    within work.
  sec: 677
  time: '11:17'
  who: Swyx
- line: You are talking about public marketing, it’s still going to derive from those
    primary factors. The channel does not matter. You need to understand what your
    personal brand is. To be able to communicate that and tell that story effectively,
    you need to understand what domain that you are picking and you are planting your
    flag on. You need to understand what business value you have delivered in the
    past and be able to tell that story — have numbers and concise descriptions of
    the projects that you have had. Then you need to work on your skills to do cool
    stuff and cover your bases. So, there are just so many details here, like we can
    go into any one of them.
  who: Swyx
- header: 'Personal Brand for Non‑star Developers: find distinctiveness'
- line: Let’s say I already have some skills. I’m not the top developer but I know
    how to code. Let’s say I know Python or JavaScript, or I’m good at data science.
    How do I find my personal brand as an average data scientist or as an average
    software engineer?
  sec: 756
  time: '12:36'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Brand Consistency: photo, name, and repeated impressions'
- line: First of all, you shouldn’t see yourself as average. That is starting on the
    wrong foot. Look for anything about you that is not average. That could be anything
    about your identity, your opinions. Maybe you’re very opinionated about one particular
    thing. A really cute way to think about whether you have a personal brand or not
    is — can people make a meme of you? Can people, your employer and your friends
    make fun of you? If they can and everyone gets it, then you really have a personal
    brand. It’s because you say something so much that people feel comfortable making
    fun of you — you’re not going to be offended. It’s something that you believe
    in.
  sec: 787
  time: '13:07'
  who: Swyx
- line: There is another thing, like having a consistent photo and consistent naming.
    Consistency is important because you form brand impressions. This is something
    that is practiced at the highest levels of marketing, like Cola, Nike. They spend
    millions of dollars making sure that like the curve of stripes logo is always
    35 degrees, they make sure that the color of Coca-Cola is always the same red.
    In the same way we need to make sure in our own personal branding that the same
    things appear in the same way every single time.
  who: Swyx
- line: It takes between 17 and 40 repeated impressions to imprint upon somebody that
    you stand for something. People should go take a professional photo — the photo
    is seen more than your actual face. All the communication is in slack these days
    or on twitter. Your photo matters a lot. Have a nice photo, smile at somebody
    that you have not met before and have a good general impression of you. That counts
    for something that is your digital storefront. They see that more than your name.
  who: Swyx
- line: 'Your name is the second most seen thing. Sometimes you can just go by your
    regular name. But sometimes that can be hard for people to remember. For me I
    have my nickname Swyx, which is my English and Chinese initials. I’ve had that
    since I was 13. It’s a unique name: I have the domain, a handle on most social
    media sites. It’s a good name.'
  who: Swyx
- line: Some people might choose to brand themselves a different way. I have a friend
    who was “JavaScript Joe” for a long time. He was the JavaScript guy for his company
    and within his network. There is another guy who is “The Entrepreneurial Coder”.
    He studies a mix of business and development. You can brand yourself in a different
    way. As long as people refer to you in the same way, then that starts to compound
    and accumulate your branding.
  who: Swyx
- line: I have another friend David Khourshid who shows up any time the word “state
    machine” is mentioned. We make memes of him and make fun of him. It’s great, it’s
    a consistent brand — anytime someone has that problem, he comes to mind immediately.
    That is what you want to achieve. You want to achieve such a strong association
    with some important problem that you can solve. We don’t go out and survey the
    entire universe with 40 million developers to know who’s the best at this thing.
    We just think about the top three or five people that everyone thinks about.
  who: Swyx
- line: Your goal as a personal branding person or a self-marketer is to get into
    that consideration. Pick 3-5 options and do that enough so that your name comes
    up. Then you get exposed to so many opportunities.
  who: Swyx
- line: So, the first thing you said, stop thinking of yourself as average. There
    is something you must be good at. Then the second thing — get a professional picture.
  sec: 1048
  time: '17:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: You don’t have to use your real face, by the way. Some people are not comfortable
    with that. You can just use a logo. Nobody knows what Sebastian Markbåge looks
    like. He uses an eucalyptus plant. He’s used that for the past 10 years. He’s
    the eucalyptus guy, that is his face. That’s fine as long as it is consistent.
  sec: 1064
  time: '17:44'
  who: Swyx
- line: You also said you need to appear at least — I do not remember the number —
    60 or 80 times.
  sec: 1084
  time: '18:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: 7 to 40. I picked this up from digital marketing guys.
  sec: 1092
  time: '18:12'
  who: Swyx
- line: It means that we need everything we just said plus 40 impressions.
  sec: 1095
  time: '18:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. In the same way that people do marketing on you. They retarget you and
    try to make their brand show up in front of you multiple times. That is how you
    are going to be to other people. We work the same way. We’re not different from
    brands. We are brands.
  sec: 1107
  time: '18:27'
  who: Swyx
- header: 'Domain Selection: choosing topics to write and speak about'
- line: How do we do this? The picture is clear, we go pay somebody to take a picture,
    a professional picture of us. With the name, it’s also somewhat clear, it’s either
    given by our parents or maybe it’s a nickname. But what to write about? What to
    tweet about?
  sec: 1123
  time: '18:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s more about the domain. I want to double down on the picture thing. If
    you have the same picture on different platforms, people form a strong emotional
    connection to you, even though you barely know them. That’s how it works for you.
    I really want to emphasize consistency and repetition.
  sec: 1143
  time: '19:03'
  who: Swyx
- line: Let’s talk about domain. A domain is something that comes from you. What do
    you work on? What are you interested in? People might have decision fatigue. You
    could be interested in a hundred different things. The advice I normally give
    here is to realize that when you pick something, you are not closing doors. You
    are not saying “I will not do anything else for the rest of my life”. You are
    just saying “this is what I am currently interested in”. You are allowed to change.
  who: Swyx
- line: Having some top topic is much better than just saying “I am equally interested
    in 10 different things”. That’s not branding. That’s not a good way to market
    you — I don’t know what your trigger point is. I cannot say “you are my whatever
    person”, like “you are my data warehouse guy”. If that’s your thing. If you are
    in all the conversations, you cannot stop talking about it. I will just mention
    the topic, and you can go on a podcast for one hour. Then that’s your domain.
    I can use you as my expert. I can send people your way, if they are also interested
    in learning more.
  who: Swyx
- line: That’s how marketing works. You have to pick a domain. People are refusing
    to pick a domain out of their fear of closing doors. They should realize that
    people change domains all the time. It’s totally fine. But just pick one up.
  who: Swyx
- line: How niche should it be?
  sec: 1268
  time: '21:08'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Niche Strategy: choosing the right level of specialization'
- line: The niche should not be too niche. There is such a thing as too niche. But
    the narrower the better. You should prove expertise, and it’s hard in a very broad
    domain. Let’s say you want to pick expertise in Python. You are going up against
    Guido van Rossum or whoever else. But if you pick a specific domain and you specialize
    in that, you have a better chance of reaching it. And people can slot you into
    their universe without competition — that’s an existing white space. I like niches,
    but be careful about being too niche. To prevent yourself from being too niche,
    be mindful of how many people have the problems you solve. As long as you can
    fill a room of 50 people with that problem, then you can have a meet up. That’s
    a good niche.
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Swyx
- line: How do you find this out? Do you try to run a meet up and see how many people
    show up?
  sec: 1338
  time: '22:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have actually done that.
  sec: 1343
  time: '22:23'
  who: Swyx
- line: Okay. What did you try? What was it?
  sec: 1344
  time: '22:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Svelte.
  sec: 1344
  time: '22:24'
  who: Swyx
- line: Is it a JavaScript framework?
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Validating a Niche: meetups, conferences, and community signals'
- line: Yeah, it’s a JavaScript framework. It’s one of the newer ones compared to
    React and Vue. It’s niche because it is the smallest one out of the big four.
    But it was just enough interest that I could start a meetup. Now we have a global
    community of about 10000 people.
  sec: 1352
  time: '22:32'
  who: Swyx
- line: You don’t have to start a meetup. You can pay attention to what people are
    talking about. Subscribe to your industry newsletters. Look out for industry conferences,
    look at the schedule of the talks. You do not even have to show up to the conference,
    you can just look at the schedule to understand what people are working on.
  who: Swyx
- line: You can look on hackernews and see what people are very interested in discussing.
    If there is a new announcement and then there is not much engagement then whatever.
    But if there are 500 comments, that’s a topic that gets people excited. If you
    can specialize in that, then you become an authority that people care about.
  who: Swyx
- line: It’s always this intersection. I call this a “nexus of interest” — the things
    that you are interested in and things that other people are very interested in.
    You need to find that intersection. You cannot just work on things that only you
    get, because nobody is going to care. Don’t be surprised if nobody cares.
  who: Swyx
- header: 'Learn in Public: honest progress, corrections, and earned expertise'
- line: To find a niche, you don’t have to start a meetup. You can subscribe to industry
    newsletters, have a look at twitter, hangout in hacker news and reddit, and check
    conferences. Then you find a topic that people seem to be excited about. Now you
    want to start writing and tweeting about this. How do you market yourself? For
    marketing we need to have a marketing channel. So, how do we select a topic? And
    how do we communicate that we know this topic?
  sec: 1433
  time: '23:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, when you start out, you actually don’t know this topic. You should not
    try to be an overnight expert. A lot of people, when they view learn in public
    and marketing yourself movement, they see a lot of hucksters, scammers or grifters
    — people who are not genuinely caring about this phase. They are just there to
    market themselves and grow their following. I definitely don’t encourage anybody
    to do that. Be genuine, be authentic and say “I don’t know anything about this
    space, but I am learning. Here is what I have learned so far” — that’s all you
    do.
  sec: 1470
  time: '24:30'
  who: Swyx
- line: You progress every single day. You become a little bit better than you were
    the day before. People can follow along on your journey. People can correct you
    if you are wrong. Eventually you will have been corrected of all the basic mistakes.
    When you look back, you’ll go “I am now an expert. I have made all the mistakes.
    I have answered a lot of other people's questions. Now I am an expert. But I have
    earned it”. You have to earn it. You cannot just say “Because I am a good marketer
    I can skip all the other steps”. No. You have to earn it.
  who: Swyx
- line: So, learn in public, inform others about your progress. What could be the
    best media for this? Social media, like Twitter, LinkedIn…
  sec: 1541
  time: '25:41'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Owned Platforms & Blogging: mailing lists, newsletters, and personal site'
- line: Social media is a borrowed platform. You are working on these platforms to
    get more distribution. But you don’t own any part of it. Twitter can lock you
    out at any time. I’ve been locked out twice by Twitter. People can cancel you.
    You can suddenly lose relevance — the algorithm changes and your pages vanish
    from Google. These are all borrowed platforms. The channels that you ultimately
    own are your own personal domain, your own personal mailing list, your own personal
    podcast. These are the things that I am focusing on right now.
  sec: 1554
  time: '25:54'
  who: Swyx
- line: You can start off with social media, but try to link people back and grow
    your own platform. Someday, when your platform is big enough, then social media
    becomes the extension of “Hey, I have a new post or talk”. That’s a fundamentally
    long-running way. There will be a day when Twitter dies or YouTube dies.
  who: Swyx
- line: Or somebody bans you from Twitter.
  sec: 1619
  time: '26:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: But the open web is going to last longer than any of us.
  sec: 1624
  time: '27:04'
  who: Swyx
- header: 'Starting Distribution: social media to drive people to your site'
- line: So, you said build a mailing list. I just picked a topic and want to start
    learning this in public. I tweet about this every day. How do I go from there
    to having my own website with a mailing list? Should I have this right from the
    start? How does it work?
  sec: 1632
  time: '27:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don’t think it hurts. It’s not that hard, especially for developers, to
    throw up a blog. Just don’t expect anyone to go to your site. They don’t know
    you. But as they start to know your work, then they will start to visit your site.
    It took a long time to get up to 50000 visits a month. You only go social to build
    your distribution from there. And then take it off those networks.
  sec: 1653
  time: '27:33'
  who: Swyx
- line: To me that is not the issue. The issue is what are you writing about or speaking
    about and does it matter to other people.
  who: Swyx
- line: I have an idea called “pick up what they put down”. When people start a public
    learning or content creation journey, they will write what they want to read.
    Then they will be very surprised that the reception is not that great. There are
    a few factors. One is they are new to it, they do not have a lot of practice.
    Don’t expect that greatest result. Second, they have not invested in the interests
    of other people. They don’t really know or have a sense of what people really
    want to hear.
  who: Swyx
- line: Having a conversation with somebody is really interesting. This idea of “picking
    what they put down” — you have mentors and leaders in the community who are putting
    out ideas all the time. They are too busy to follow through on most of them. They
    are always looking for partners and experts and mentees to follow up on the stuff
    that they do. If they put out a new blog post, read it and respond to it. If they
    put a new demo, try it out the code and report bugs. If they put out a new book,
    go through and summarize it and promote it for them.
  who: Swyx
- line: These are all interesting ways. Individually they may not work at all. You
    just might get ignored. But your chances of being noticed and responded to are
    way higher than the average. I had someone who was like “I am going to start learning
    public”. The first thing that they wrote was a guide to man pages in Linux. I
    don’t get up in the morning and read a guide for man pages. There may be people
    who do that, but I am not going to find them. But if you wrote a response to a
    blog post that I just put out this morning, I am going to read it.
  who: Swyx
- line: What did you post today?

    ago. I’ve been thinking about it — what if Stripe is the next Google. Stripe is
    currently worth 100 billion dollars, Google is worth 1500 billion dollars. How
    do you position yourself if Stripe becomes the next Google and you knew that for
    a fact? There is so much economic and career opportunity there. Nobody is thinking
    about it. We always think about where things are today. People try to optimize
    for FANG. but stripe is an up-and-coming FANG. It’s better to tie yourself to
    a becomer rather than something that is already at the top. Paul is probably going
    to read my post. I directly addressed him. But if someone else responds to my
    post, I will read that.

    Netlify is because I started using them. I started tweeting about them. And guess
    what? Every single startup, every single company has a Slack channel that is dedicated
    to people tweeting about their service. They want to know, they want to read,
    they want to respond. If you want to guarantee yourself being read by someone,
    criticize them, praise them. It becomes focused on their interests rather than
    yours.

    — leaving something on the table for people to continue on and carry on with —  most
    people just leave it there. They ignore it. Or they say “Very nice. I have my

    and people give you feedback. Do you take that feedback, internalize it and come
    back with the feedback incorporated? And also think “what else does this line

    the opportunity to work in tech — to figure out how it works, what’s the terminology
    and where I should be focusing my attention to. Then it took another year for

    not that large. Then there is a company. I want to say “Hire me. Let’s have this

    my first job, I applied to nine and I got offers at three of them. It’s a good
    conversion. You only need one job. Your conversion goes up because you have more
    time to research these companies and be more intentional about why you want to

    bit less visible. But you can build a clone. I’ve seen a lot of people build slack
    clones or clubhouse clones. It shows a level of understanding of the engineering
    decisions behind such a product. You can often skip quite a few interview rounds

    summary of that book. To your personal perspective. To any stories that you might
    have had that relate to this. These are nuances that you could cover by writing

  sec: 2834
  time: '47:14'
  who: Swyx
- line: I should have mentioned the idea of open source knowledge earlier. We used
    to have encyclopedias like encyclopedia Britannica and others. They would hire
    thousands of editors and write 50 different books on everything on earth to know
    about. Then Wikipedia comes along with the 100th of their budget and it just destroys
    all of them. Now Wikipedia is the only encyclopedia anyone uses. We should have
    a thousand different small Wikipedia’s on every single topic.

  sec: 2898

    You want to come along and contribute, you want the authoritative source of something.
  sec: 2902
  time: '48:22'
  who: Swyx
- line: The idea behind open source knowledge is we replicate Wikipedia for anything
    complicated, for things that people need to refer to. When I was learning React
    and TypeScript, the React team had their own typed JavaScript solution. They were
    not interested in documenting TypeScripts. And the TypeStript team focused on
    being framework agnostic, they were not going to document React. So I documented
    the intersection of React and TypeScript. That cheat sheet now has like 30000
    stars on GitHub and people contribute. Now many people know of me through that
    work. That’s a little bit of marketing me as well.
  who: Swyx
- line: This is the idea of collaborative knowledge gathering. I saw today that someone
    compiled a reference list of all the header tags in html and it has 30,000 stars.
    It’s amazing. That’s the kind of thing that people need to reference all the time.
    If you keep a list and you let people contribute, then it automatically becomes
    part of your personal brand and marketing.
  who: Swyx
- line: It's a really nice way to grow. Learning and blogging is a very solo individual
    activity. But if you can build a community around the thing that you are trying
    to learn, that is even better. You are going to learn much faster.
  who: Swyx
- line: I call this the “big L notation”. In the big O notation, you have the scaling
    factors. People have different scaling factors around their learning. If you learn
    with other people, then you learn at a rate of L of N times P. I have a whole
    blog about big L. There’s some theory behind this which I really like.
  who: Swyx
- line: I also wanted to talk to you a bit about internal marketing — internally within
    a company. For promotions, internal marketing can be more important than external.
    What is the best way of doing this? Do you have any recommendations on how we

- header: 'Internal Promotion Tools: brag document, demos, and networking'
- line: This is a really important topic as well. No matter what you do, you have
    to promote yourself internally. The main advice here is to have a brag document.
    I got this idea from Julia Evans. A Bragg document is a 1-2 page summary of the
    things that you have accomplished at the company. Have it ready at all times.
    It helps your manager to advocate for you. Whenever you meet someone in senior
    management and they need to know what you have done, you can just share the document
    with them. You don’t have to give them the document, you can just say it.
  sec: 3070

  who: Swyx
- line: Having your accomplishments in front of you helps as a motivational pickup.
    Sometimes when you have a bad day, you can just go back — “actually I have some
    value at this company”.
  who: Swyx
- line: You can also make it easy for other people to be your advocate. Personal brand
    is what people say about you when you are not in the room. If you have a strong
    personal brand, then you make it easy for people to say your top accomplishments
    and become your advocates.
  who: Swyx
- line: One simple way that engineers can do personal marketing within the company
    is to take advantage of demos and standups. People usually approach it from a
    very routine point of view. I have to go stand up, I will say my thing and then
    I will pretend to be interested in what other people say. Turn it into a story,
    an enjoyable experience, celebrate accomplishments and share the accomplishments
    of others with the rest of your company. Then you are seen as a source of positive
    energy in your team.
  who: Swyx
- line: When there’s a demo day, or a sprint showcase or a hackathon, most people
    do not volunteer. But if you take that opportunity, you get to put your work and
    your team's work in front of the rest of the company. People will know you better.
    That may seem like not very much, but when people need someone from your department,
    they will think of you first.
  who: Swyx
- line: Marketing is about getting to be first on people's minds. You provided some
    value in the past or you strongly associated yourself with some problem that people
    need. These are all valuable things within a company.
  who: Swyx
- line: So, we have a brag document which is a 1-2 page summary. We do demos every
    time it’s possible. And we network with people, share knowledge with them, talk
    to them, mentor them, and help them. Right?

    He’s just like a thousand other front-end engineers within the company. But he
    decided to start a JavaScript guild within the company in his free time. He just
    sent an internal newsletter to keep people informed of the latest JavaScript developments.
  who: Swyx
- line: It’s very routine and nothing special. It involves JavaScript and it involves
    people — and that’s what people discuss internally at work. It became a small
    community within Dropbox. Then it evolved into an internal conference. Everyone
    had a whole day together where they discussed company specific issues within JavaScript.
    He became the JavaScript domain expert within Dropbox. It’s a huge deal. It has
    nothing to do with his team. He just created an initiative, the management supported
    him by giving him some funding and some space to do that.
  who: Swyx
- line: There are many opportunities to do that. It’s crazy that people don’t take
    initiative at work. A lot of people are just sitting back and waiting for people
    to tell them what to do. If you find an opportunity and take leadership of it,
    people will give you more responsibility. They are always looking for someone
    who can take that responsibility.
  who: Swyx
- line: I will give you another example. Zack Argyle used to work at Pinterest. He
    was a believer in the opportunity for progressive web apps at Pinterest. He was
    trying to promote PWA within Pinterest for a long time. At hackathon, he built
    a clone of Pinterest with PWA and presented it directly to the company CEO, Ben
    Silverman. He did it in two days and showed that the metrics were way better,
    that it was going to be a very good positive performance for pinterest. Now Pinterest’s
    full web app is a PWA. It’s because of him.

    Good in a sense that people have to listen to you — they work with you. It’s bad
    when you are overly self-promotional, then they will have a negative opinion of
    you. But if you are trying to provide a service genuinely or do something beneficial
    for the company, people would back you. It’s less competition — you are just within
    your company. You can talk about more specific things and problems that your company
    has. People outside one are not going to know about it or you cannot talk about
    it — it’s a company secret.

    When doing talks — the work involved in making a talk is half of the battle. Once

    showing leadership as a speaker in that domain. When you interview, that’s speaking

    a coupon code there, but I don’t have a coupon. It’s very annoying.

    to say before I try to conclude it?

- line: I don’t get to talk about the marketing chapter enough. There is so much to
    career development. I always want to invite people to have a discussion about
    this. We don’t talk about it enough. We always talk about code. We should talk
    about the 75% of the engineering ladder criteria that is not technical.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I studied 30 different career ladders up there. Most of them — even
    CircleCI, which is one of the most technical companies on earth — talk about communication,
    understanding of business impact, stuff like that. It’s not about code. That’s
    what the book was like.

- line: Yeah, go check the book. That's the last thing I want to say today. And I
    want to wish everyone a great weekend. Thanks for joining. Good bye.
