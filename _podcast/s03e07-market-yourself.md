- line: "This week we will talk about marketing ourselves. We have a special guest\
    \ today, Swyx aka Swyx. Shawn is a developer, PM and angel investor, who is active\
    \ in the development community. He is a frequent speaker and writer. I bet you\
    \ already know him from his \u201Clearn in public\u201D movement that he advocates.\
    \ Welcome! Thanks for coming today."

  who: Alexey
- line: "Thanks for having me. I have been hanging out in the DataTalks slack. I have\
    \ been getting a lot of questions on the book. It\u2019s been really great \u2014\
    \ sharing thoughts on these things. I don\u2019t think we discuss this stuff enough\
    \ as developers. It\u2019s soft but it\u2019s as important as coding."

- line: "I agree. That\u2019s why I thought it\u2019s a really great idea to reach\
    \ out to you. I was very happy when you said that you want to join our podcast.\
    \ But before we go into our main topic of marketing ourselves, let\u2019s start\
    \ with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?"
  sec: 123
  time: '2:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I am originally from Singapore. I moved to the States for college. My first\
    \ career was in finance. I did everything from central banking to investment banking\
    \ to hedge funds. If anyone is familiar with the finance industry \u2014 that\
    \ is a grand tour of everything there is to do in the finance industry. To level\
    \ up in finance, you learn to code \u2014 in order to run quantitative models\
    \ and risk management and pricing and all that. That\u2019s what I did. I realized\
    \ that was something I wanted to do and was better at than the finance part."
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Swyx
- line: I did a career switch at age 30 and started over as a junior. I went to a
    bootcamp, did freecodecamp and worked my way through the ranks. I joined 2-sigma
    as a front-end engineer, then I got noticed by Netlify. That is when I started
    really doing the learn-in-public stuff. New York City was just a really good place
    to do speaking. I started blogging about reacts as well. I worked at Netlify for
    two years. Then I joined AWS. I recently left AWS to be head of developer experience
    at Temporal.io.
  who: Swyx
- line: "Last year I wrote down a book of career advice. As much as my writing on\
    \ React and Svelte and JavaScript has been popular, the most popular stuff has\
    \ been the non-technical stuff. I decided to write down everything that I have\
    \ absorbed. I have resources that I collect \u2014 I am a part of \u201Cbuilding\
    \ a second brain\u201D movement. I have my second brain. \u201CThe coding career\
    \ handbook\u201D is my second brain of 1500 links, resources, tweets and advice\
    \ that I have collected from other people. I am not the authority, but I borrowed\
    \ authority from other people. It was a good exercise to write. It resonated with\
    \ a lot of people. People are learning how to code, cracking the interview, then\
    \ they get past the interview, they get the job and then they are like \u201C\
    now what?\u201D There is a huge gap between that and being a senior. Everyone\
    \ only wants to hire seniors. My goal is to help people level up from junior to\
    \ senior."
  who: Swyx
- line: "I work at developer relations. This topic of marketing is a big one for people.\
    \ According to a survey that I saw, most developers understand that there is some\
    \ value to marketing. They just don\u2019t see themselves doing it. They see other\
    \ people doing it. They see it, they are like \u201CThis person is already internet\
    \ famous. That is not for me\u201D. A part of what I am trying to do here is to\
    \ dispel that notion that you have to be internet famous. There is some level\
    \ of self-marketing that you should do, otherwise people are not going to know\
    \ what you did or how good you are."
  who: Swyx
- line: Interesting! You started in finance, you worked as quantitative analytics.
    And you also now join Temporal.io which is a data processing company. You are
    a lot closer to data than I thought.
  sec: 341
  time: '5:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I work on the front end of that company. I don\u2019t know all the details.\
    \ But yes, it can be used for data. We are not focused on just data, but we can\
    \ talk about that when the time comes."
  sec: 358
  time: '5:58'
  who: Swyx
- header: Marketing ourselves
- line: About marketing ourselves. You are one of the people I follow on Twitter for
    stuff like marketing ourselves and learning in public. So I wanted to ask you,
    why should we market ourselves? Why is it important for our careers? You have
    touched it a bit, but maybe we can expand it.
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: "There are a lot of whys. It\u2019s very personal. Why do you do what you\
    \ do? It\u2019s very different from why I do what I do. There is part of it which\
    \ is getting recognition for your skills and your work. If you ever wondered,\
    \ why did you not get that promotion? Why someone else, who seems to know less\
    \ than you, seems to do better as a career? It\u2019s perhaps because they are\
    \ marketing themselves better than you are. That\u2019s an easy thing to fix \u2014\
    \ the hard thing is actually doing stuff. I want people, who have the quality\
    \ and have the genuine skill, to be able to represent themselves better, so that\
    \ they can get in front of the right opportunities and the right employers and\
    \ do better for themselves."
  sec: 403
  time: '6:43'
  who: Swyx
- line: "If you don\u2019t market yourself, then other people, who are less shy about\
    \ it, will put themselves out there. They will get those opportunities. Maybe\
    \ they wouldn\u2019t do as good of a job as you might. That\u2019s ultimately\
    \ the breakdown. At a bare minimum, when you market yourself well, you get more\
    \ money \u2014 more lifetime opportunities that translate into earnings. That\u2019\
    s a fundamental motivator for anyone."
  who: Swyx
- line: Like for a company who cares about some internal KPIs, at the end, what they
    care about is profit, right?
  sec: 501
  time: '8:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I don\u2019t want to make it too commercial. When you create an open source\
    \ project and you want people to use your stuff for free, you still have to market\
    \ your project. That\u2019s a similar skill. Or whenever you are trying to push\
    \ an idea that you want to promote within the company. Let\u2019s say you want\
    \ to switch to this other tech stack or you have this feature idea, you have to\
    \ market that idea."
  sec: 513
  time: '8:33'
  who: Swyx
- line: These are all parts of marketing yourself. They will be affected by your credibility,
    but also your ability to market that idea. These are all related skills that you
    should practice and compound through the rest of your life.
  who: Swyx
- line: "We want to do this because we want to get more recognition. We want to get\
    \ more recognition because we want to be promoted. We have the technical skills,\
    \ but for people in tech, myself included, it\u2019s easier to code rather than\
    \ go and stay in front of people. Even just tweeting is also difficult. You can\
    \ start thinking \u201Cwhat people will think about me\u201D. But compared to\
    \ what we are doing as developers, this is a lot easier, it\u2019s only 280 characters.\
    \ It\u2019s easier than writing a big system. We should use this opportunity and\
    \ then get that promotion or get a better job or get recognition. And if you are\
    \ an open source author, people will find your library. Right?"

  who: Alexey
- line: Yes sir. Exactly!
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Swyx
- header: Components of personal marketing
- line: "Let\u2019s say I want to become better. I want to get recognition outside\
    \ of my company. I know how to code. I am relatively good at this, maybe better\
    \ than some of my colleagues, and worse than some others. I\u2019m an average\
    \ developer. What do I need to do to be better at personal marketing? What do\
    \ I need to do?"
  sec: 626
  time: '10:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That is a very broad question. When I wrote my book, I published a chapter\
    \ from there for free. It was part of marketing for the book. This is very meta\
    \ \u2014 writing about marketing while marketing. There is a graphic where I break\
    \ down marketing in terms of personal branding, the domain that you pick, the\
    \ business value that you can deliver, the tech skills that you have and the channel\
    \ which you are delivering to \u2014 whether you are talking about public marketing\
    \ or internal within work."
  sec: 677
  time: '11:17'
  who: Swyx
- line: "You are talking about public marketing, it\u2019s still going to derive from\
    \ those primary factors. The channel does not matter. You need to understand what\
    \ your personal brand is. To be able to communicate that and tell that story effectively,\
    \ you need to understand what domain that you are picking and you are planting\
    \ your flag on. You need to understand what business value you have delivered\
    \ in the past and be able to tell that story \u2014 have numbers and concise descriptions\
    \ of the projects that you have had. Then you need to work on your skills to do\
    \ cool stuff and cover your bases. So, there are just so many details here, like\
    \ we can go into any one of them."
  who: Swyx
- header: Personal brand for an average developer
- line: "Let\u2019s say I already have some skills. I\u2019m not the top developer\
    \ but I know how to code. Let\u2019s say I know Python or JavaScript, or I\u2019\
    m good at data science. How do I find my personal brand as an average data scientist\
    \ or as an average software engineer?"
  sec: 756
  time: '12:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: "First of all, you shouldn\u2019t see yourself as average. That is starting\
    \ on the wrong foot. Look for anything about you that is not average. That could\
    \ be anything about your identity, your opinions. Maybe you\u2019re very opinionated\
    \ about one particular thing. A really cute way to think about whether you have\
    \ a personal brand or not is \u2014 can people make a meme of you? Can people,\
    \ your employer and your friends make fun of you? If they can and everyone gets\
    \ it, then you really have a personal brand. It\u2019s because you say something\
    \ so much that people feel comfortable making fun of you \u2014 you\u2019re not\
    \ going to be offended. It\u2019s something that you believe in."
  sec: 787
  time: '13:07'
  who: Swyx
- line: There is another thing, like having a consistent photo and consistent naming.
    Consistency is important because you form brand impressions. This is something
    that is practiced at the highest levels of marketing, like Cola, Nike. They spend
    millions of dollars making sure that like the curve of stripes logo is always
    35 degrees, they make sure that the color of Coca-Cola is always the same red.
    In the same way we need to make sure in our own personal branding that the same
    things appear in the same way every single time.
  who: Swyx
- line: "It takes between 17 and 40 repeated impressions to imprint upon somebody\
    \ that you stand for something. People should go take a professional photo \u2014\
    \ the photo is seen more than your actual face. All the communication is in slack\
    \ these days or on twitter. Your photo matters a lot. Have a nice photo, smile\
    \ at somebody that you have not met before and have a good general impression\
    \ of you. That counts for something that is your digital storefront. They see\
    \ that more than your name."
  who: Swyx
- line: "Your name is the second most seen thing. Sometimes you can just go by your\
    \ regular name. But sometimes that can be hard for people to remember. For me\
    \ I have my nickname Swyx, which is my English and Chinese initials. I\u2019ve\
    \ had that since I was 13. It\u2019s a unique name: I have the domain, a handle\
    \ on most social media sites. It\u2019s a good name."
  who: Swyx
- line: "Some people might choose to brand themselves a different way. I have a friend\
    \ who was \u201CJavaScript Joe\u201D for a long time. He was the JavaScript guy\
    \ for his company and within his network. There is another guy who is \u201CThe\
    \ Entrepreneurial Coder\u201D. He studies a mix of business and development. You\
    \ can brand yourself in a different way. As long as people refer to you in the\
    \ same way, then that starts to compound and accumulate your branding."
  who: Swyx
- line: "I have another friend David Khourshid who shows up any time the word \u201C\
    state machine\u201D is mentioned. We make memes of him and make fun of him. It\u2019\
    s great, it\u2019s a consistent brand \u2014 anytime someone has that problem,\
    \ he comes to mind immediately. That is what you want to achieve. You want to\
    \ achieve such a strong association with some important problem that you can solve.\
    \ We don\u2019t go out and survey the entire universe with 40 million developers\
    \ to know who\u2019s the best at this thing. We just think about the top three\
    \ or five people that everyone thinks about."
  who: Swyx
- line: Your goal as a personal branding person or a self-marketer is to get into
    that consideration. Pick 3-5 options and do that enough so that your name comes
    up. Then you get exposed to so many opportunities.
  who: Swyx
- line: "So, the first thing you said, stop thinking of yourself as average. There\
    \ is something you must be good at. Then the second thing \u2014 get a professional\
    \ picture."
  sec: 1048
  time: '17:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "You don\u2019t have to use your real face, by the way. Some people are not\
    \ comfortable with that. You can just use a logo. Nobody knows what Sebastian\
    \ Mark looks like. He uses an eucalyptus plant. He\u2019s used that for the past\
    \ 10 years. He\u2019s the eucalyptus guy, that is his face. That\u2019s fine as\
    \ long as it is consistent."
  sec: 1064
  time: '17:44'
  who: Swyx
- line: "You also said you need to appear at least \u2014 I do not remember the number\
    \ \u2014 60 or 80 times."
  sec: 1084
  time: '18:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: 7 to 40. I picked this up from digital marketing guys.
  sec: 1092
  time: '18:12'
  who: Swyx
- line: It means that we need everything we just said plus 40 impressions.
  sec: 1095
  time: '18:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. In the same way that people do marketing on you. They retarget you and\
    \ try to make their brand show up in front of you multiple times. That is how\
    \ you are going to be to other people. We work the same way. We\u2019re not different\
    \ from brands. We are brands."

  who: Swyx
- header: 'Picking a domain: what to write about?'
- line: "How do we do this? The picture is clear, we go pay somebody to take a picture,\
    \ a professional picture of us. With the name, it\u2019s also somewhat clear,\
    \ it\u2019s either given by our parents or maybe it\u2019s a nickname. But what\
    \ to write about? What to tweet about?"
  sec: 1123
  time: '18:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It\u2019s more about the domain. I want to double down on the picture thing.\
    \ If you have the same picture on different platforms, people form a strong emotional\
    \ connection to you, even though you barely know them. That\u2019s how it works\
    \ for you. I really want to emphasize consistency and repetition."
  sec: 1143
  time: '19:03'
  who: Swyx
- line: "Let\u2019s talk about domain. A domain is something that comes from you.\
    \ What do you work on? What are you interested in? People might have decision\
    \ fatigue. You could be interested in a hundred different things. The advice I\
    \ normally give here is to realize that when you pick something, you are not closing\
    \ doors. You are not saying \u201CI will not do anything else for the rest of\
    \ my life\u201D. You are just saying \u201Cthis is what I am currently interested\
    \ in\u201D. You are allowed to change."
  who: Swyx
- line: "Having some top topic is much better than just saying \u201CI am equally\
    \ interested in 10 different things\u201D. That\u2019s not branding. That\u2019\
    s not a good way to market you \u2014 I don\u2019t know what your trigger point\
    \ is. I cannot say \u201Cyou are my whatever person\u201D, like \u201Cyou are\
    \ my data warehouse guy\u201D. If that\u2019s your thing. If you are in all the\
    \ conversations, you cannot stop talking about it. I will just mention the topic,\
    \ and you can go on a podcast for one hour. Then that\u2019s your domain. I can\
    \ use you as my expert. I can send people your way, if they are also interested\
    \ in learning more."
  who: Swyx
- line: "That\u2019s how marketing works. You have to pick a domain. People are refusing\
    \ to pick a domain out of their fear of closing doors. They should realize that\
    \ people change domains all the time. It\u2019s totally fine. But just pick one\
    \ up."

- line: How niche should it be?
  sec: 1268
  time: '21:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: "The niche should not be too niche. There is such a thing as too niche. But\
    \ the narrower the better. You should prove expertise, and it\u2019s hard in a\
    \ very broad domain. Let\u2019s say you want to pick expertise in Python. You\
    \ are going up against Guido van Rossum or whoever else. But if you pick a specific\
    \ domain and you specialize in that, you have a better chance of reaching it.\
    \ And people can slot you into their universe without competition \u2014 that\u2019\
    s an existing white space. I like niches, but be careful about being too niche.\
    \ To prevent yourself from being too niche, be mindful of how many people have\
    \ the problems you solve. As long as you can fill a room of 50 people with that\
    \ problem, then you can have a meet up. That\u2019s a good niche."

    \ to React and Vue. It\u2019s niche because it is the smallest one out of the\
    \ big four. But it was just enough interest that I could start a meetup. Now we\

    \ excited about. Now you want to start writing and tweeting about this. How do\

    \ or grifters \u2014 people who are not genuinely caring about this phase. They\
    \ are just there to market themselves and grow their following. I definitely don\u2019\
    t encourage anybody to do that. Be genuine, be authentic and say \u201CI don\u2019\

    \ your pages vanish from Google. These are all borrowed platforms. The channels\
    \ that you ultimately own are your own personal domain, your own personal mailing\

    \ initiative, the management supported him by giving him some funding and some\
    \ space to do that."
  who: Swyx
- line: "There are many opportunities to do that. It\u2019s crazy that people don\u2019\
    t take initiative at work. A lot of people are just sitting back and waiting for\
    \ people to tell them what to do. If you find an opportunity and take leadership\
    \ of it, people will give you more responsibility. They are always looking for\
    \ someone who can take that responsibility."
  who: Swyx
- line: "I will give you another example. Zack Argyle used to work at Pinterest. He\
    \ was a believer in the opportunity for progressive web apps at Pinterest. He\
    \ was trying to promote PWA within Pinterest for a long time. At hackathon, he\
    \ built a clone of Pinterest with PWA and presented it directly to the company\
    \ CEO, Ben Silverman. He did it in two days and showed that the metrics were way\
    \ better, that it was going to be a very good positive performance for pinterest.\
    \ Now Pinterest\u2019s full web app is a PWA. It\u2019s because of him."

    \ it\u2019s good for the company. it will probably be good for your career as\
    \ well."

    \ Promoting ourselves to the outside world \u2014 we can do the same thing inside\
    \ the company. We can start a newsletter inside the company. In this case our\
    \ audience would be just the company. Then you become known for this thing inside\
    \ the company. It\u2019s interesting. I never thought about it. You can use the\
    \ same tricks inside as you would use outside."

    \ you. It\u2019s bad when you are overly self-promotional, then they will have\
    \ a negative opinion of you. But if you are trying to provide a service genuinely\
    \ or do something beneficial for the company, people would back you. It\u2019\
    s less competition \u2014 you are just within your company. You can talk about\
    \ more specific things and problems that your company has. People outside one\
    \ are not going to know about it or you cannot talk about it \u2014 it\u2019s\

    \ say. When doing talks \u2014 the work involved in making a talk is half of the\
    \ battle. Once you have done the talk, you can send it around. Established speakers\
    \ do well by showing leadership as a speaker in that domain. When you interview,\
    \ that\u2019s speaking as well. You should practice that as much as possible when\
    \ you don\u2019t need it. So when you do need, you have experience at organizing\
    \ your thoughts and responding to questions."

    \ about this. I have written about these topics. I have a fair amount of experience\
    \ now in doing podcasts and speaking. I highly recommend people do that. When\
