transcript:
- line: Today we'll talk about career transitioning from software engineering to machine
    learning. We have a special guest today, Santiago. Santiago is a director of computer
    vision solutions at Levitas. There, he leads a small team of software engineers
    and machine learning engineers. Santiago is a computer scientist who focuses on
    applied machine learning. You probably know Santiago from his Twitter. On Twitter,
    every day, he shares a lot of practical things about machine learning. Thanks,
    Santiago, for joining us today. Welcome.

- header: "Santiago\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go into our main topic of moving from software engineering to machine
    learning, maybe we can start with your background. Can you tell us about your
    career journey so far?
  sec: 199
  time: '3:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Absolutely. I started as a software developer. I went to college, got a computer\
    \ science degree, and I started building software. I think it was 2015 when I\
    \ decided to go for a Master's in computer science. Back then, I had no idea about\
    \ machine learning. I didn't have any interest in it. It was during the Masters\
    \ that I decided to focus more on machine learning. I know you've been using the\
    \ term \u201Ctransitioning from software engineering to machine learning\u201D\
    . I like the term \u201Cadding to my skill set the machine learning skills\u201D\
    \ more because I think if you're a software engineer, you are already providing\
    \ a lot of value. By incorporating machine learning now, you're augmenting the\
    \ impact that you can have on the industry. That's basically a short description\
    \ of how I went about it. It was through my Master's that I started working more\
    \ on machine learning and getting more responsibilities in that area. This goes\
    \ up to today, where I'm mostly focused on that area."
  sec: 208
  time: '3:28'
  who: Santiago
- line: I'm following you on Twitter. I noticed that you recently posted a picture
    from your youth. I think it was from Cuba. It was a picture of a newspaper. You're
    from Cuba originally, right?
  sec: 276
  time: '4:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: I am from Cuba. Yeah. I came here to the United States back in 2009. May 1st
    of 2009. I've been here for 12 years now.
  sec: 291
  time: '4:51'
  who: Santiago
- line: Okay. So you did your Bachelor's there (in Cuba)?
  sec: 304
  time: '5:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I did my Bachelor's in Cuba for computer science. Then I went through\
    \ my Master's here in the States. It was Georgia Tech \u2013 their online Master's\
    \ program, which is fantastic."
  sec: 309
  time: '5:09'
  who: Santiago
- line: "Yeah, I think I saw this online. Because you post so much on Twitter I already\
    \ know this bit as well. I think in this picture that you shared from Cuba, it\
    \ was two guys \u2013 you and your friend \u2013 and you're staring at the computer.\
    \ Your comment was that you didn't have an internet connection back then."
  sec: 321
  time: '5:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think the first time we saw internet during my college degree, I think it
    was 2000, maybe 2001, was the first time that we got access to internet. Back
    then it was about having a couple of books and that was it. The knowledge that
    we shared was mouth to mouth. You had to talk to people if you wanted to know
    something that you didn't already know. It was very different from the way it
    is today. You can find so much information online. Literally anything that you
    want to know is going to be online in some form. Definitely very different from
    back then.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Santiago
- line: Yeah, I see why you love books.
  sec: 386
  time: '6:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, yeah. That's exactly why I love books. For sure.
  sec: 388
  time: '6:28'
  who: Santiago
- header: "\u201CTransitioning to ML\u201D vs \u201CAdding ML as a skill\u201D"
- line: "You mentioned that you don't like when I say \u201Ctransitioning from software\
    \ engineering to machine learning.\u201D You said that you don't like this word\
    \ \u201Ctransitioning\u201D because you didn't really transition, but you just\
    \ added machine learning to your skillset as a software engineer. Is that right?\
    \ Do you think that software engineers are already qualified to do machine learning?"
  sec: 393
  time: '6:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I do, actually. This is what I think. One of the hardest skills for you to\
    \ get and start providing value in the machine learning field is coding \u2013\
    \ your ability to develop solutions \u2013 your ability to make the computer do\
    \ what you want. That's one of the hottest skills that you can build. If you're\
    \ a software engineer, if you already have that skill, you're definitely halfway\
    \ home. You\u2019re definitely half there in terms of what's needed to be successful\
    \ in the machine learning field. It's interesting that most people are afraid\
    \ of math. But what I've seen is that most people that don't continue, the ones\
    \ that are left behind \u2013 it's not because they lack math skills, it's because\
    \ they lack coding skills. If you were to ask \u201CWho's better positioned to\
    \ be successful?\u201D Nine times out of ten, I'm gonna pick the person who already\
    \ knows how to develop software and provide value through software."

- header: Getting over the fear of math for software developers
- line: So, software engineers are basically already qualified for this work?
  sec: 482
  time: '8:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
  sec: 485
  time: '8:05'
  who: Santiago
- line: They just need to convince themselves that math is not the worst.
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's not that scary. It's not that scary. Yeah, math \u2013 you're going\
    \ to need math. And yeah, the deeper you go, math is gonna become more important.\
    \ But it's not that scary. I promise you, if you have the skills to build software,\
    \ you can have a huge impact just with those skills and a little bit more math\
    \ that you're going to incorporate as you go. Yeah, for sure."
  sec: 492
  time: '8:12'
  who: Santiago
- line: "Yes. But how do we, as software engineers, convince ourselves that math is\
    \ not scary? When I was studying machine learning I remember, especially when\
    \ you talk about more difficult concepts like support vector machines, there are\
    \ all these crazy formulas. Maybe somebody who studies math will disagree that\
    \ they\u2019re \u2018crazy\u2019 and say \u201COh, it\u2019s like third grade\
    \ calculus. Whatever.\u201D But when I look at this, it's scary. So how do I convince\
    \ myself that it's not scary? That I shouldn't worry about this thing?"
  sec: 516
  time: '8:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: "A great question. Number one. We have to think about who's chairing machine\
    \ learning content mostly. If you think about it, it\u2019s mostly coming from\
    \ academia. It\u2019s papers. It\u2019s the people who invented those formulas\
    \ that are writing the books and recording YouTube videos. Obviously, it's really\
    \ hard when you get to a blog post and you cannot get past the second paragraph\
    \ because there is a huge formula right at the beginning. I have the hope that\
    \ that's going to get better over time."
  sec: 557
  time: '9:17'
  who: Santiago
- line: "I'm working on it. A bunch of people are working on it \u2013 trying to share\
    \ the other side of machine learning. It is a very different approach \u2013 to\
    \ understand and to learn how to make progress in the field. Instead of starting\
    \ with how the thing is built, you start with what can you use and how you can\
    \ use this concept to solve that problem. It's a very different approach. Think\
    \ about when you go to school and they teach you a bunch of physics and chemistry\
    \ and math. Just because it's a general foundation that maybe you're going to\
    \ need later. Or maybe you will not need it later. That has pros, but it also\
    \ bores a lot of people. A lot of people started there and they don't know where\
    \ they're going. They go through so much math content that they don't know, \u201C\
    Why is this gonna be useful?\u201C"
  who: Santiago
- line: "Another approach is to start with problems \u2013 look at a problem and say,\
    \ \u201CWhat do I need in order to solve that problem?\u201D Yes, I know that\
    \ a lot of people will say, \u201CWell, you cannot use something effectively unless\
    \ you know how that thing works.\u201D I understand that. But there is a spectrum.\
    \ You can know very, very low level details of how it works internally. Or you\
    \ might know just the necessary things that it does in order to solve the problem.\
    \ Not everyone that\u2019s using sorting a list right now knows exactly how the\
    \ algorithm works. I know extremely effective Python programmers that don't even\
    \ know that the sorting behind Python is called Timsort. They have no idea. They\
    \ can still sort lists, right? Now, some other person will tell you, \u201CBut\
    \ if something goes wrong with sort, they will not be sure of why.\u201D When\
    \ that happens, they can go and dive deeper and get the knowledge that they need\
    \ to understand how team sort works. But I don't think everyone needs to start\
    \ from the nuts and bolts of the content. I think you could also start from the\
    \ beginning and try to make an impact."
  who: Santiago
- line: That's things like Auto ML is doing. They're providing tools that you can
    use without having to know the calculus that goes on behind the scenes. I think
    that it's a different approach and it's something that you're gonna see more and
    more of as time goes on.
  who: Santiago
- line: "Also, to add to your analogy of knowing sorting \u2013 how many times does\
    \ it happen that your sorting algorithm doesn't work? Has it ever happened to\
    \ you that sorting didn\u2019t work?"
  sec: 733
  time: '12:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Never, no. By the way, I'm not talking about not understanding sorting at\
    \ all \u2013 it\u2019s a good idea to know it. I'm saying it\u2019s a spectrum.\
    \ How much you understand about sorting will definitely help you. If you know\
    \ more, it might be helpful for you. That's okay. But you cannot limit people\
    \ just because they don't know things like sort. You should not limit them on\
    \ what they can accomplish."
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Santiago
- line: "You shouldn't guard them from the computer and say \u201CNo, don't touch\
    \ the keyboard until you can show me all the properties of Timsort.\u201D Right?"
  sec: 741
  time: '12:21'
  who: Alexey
- header: Learning by explaining
- line: "Absolutely. For example, I've been posting a lot of content on Twitter. The\
    \ approach that usually I take is \u201CHow much jargon can I remove from this\
    \ content so more people understand what's happening?\u201D So if I'm going to\
    \ talk about something \u2013 let's say I just posted a tweet last week about\
    \ ensemble learning. When you read the topic online, there is so much jargon and\
    \ things that you need to know in order to even understand why an ensemble works.\
    \ My challenge is \u2013 how do I remove all of that and still make it accessible\
    \ to more people? They might not be ready to maybe build an ensemble, but they\
    \ will understand that it\u2019s a tool that they can pick up. They understand\
    \ that it's valuable. They understand the situations where they can use it. I\
    \ think you're going to see more and more of that kind of content coming, because\
    \ more people are going to want to use machine learning and apply it to their\
    \ use cases. So I think that's a good thing."
  sec: 780
  time: '13:00'
  who: Santiago
- line: "Yeah, it's a good thing that you're doing on Twitter, because you have this\
    \ ability to put complex things in simple terms. And I agree with everything you\
    \ say. To me, sometimes I feel like you can read my mind and just tweet it out.\
    \ This is really great. Because I agree with almost everything you say. This is\
    \ cool. Thanks for doing this. How do you actually go about removing this jargon?\
    \ Even though it's not super related to the topic today, I still think it's interesting.\
    \ Complex things like ensemble learning \u2013 How do you make it accessible for\
    \ people?"
  sec: 842
  time: '14:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think this goes more into writing about what I do. But just as a way to\
    \ answer the question \u2013 I write down an outline of what I want to explain\
    \ and then I use my wife as my guinea pig, \u201CCan you understand what's happening\
    \ here?\u201D She usually points out terms that, to me are very clear, but have\
    \ no meaning to her. That helps me a lot. I usually also ask myself the question,\
    \ \u201CCan a six year old understand what I'm trying to put down here?\u201D\
    \ You know what, sometimes you can do it. But it's always about trying a little\
    \ bit harder \u2013 gain feedback from the people who read the content. What questions\
    \ do they ask? Does it help them? And then incorporate that feedback in your next\
    \ thread. This is usually a battle. It's usually also a spectrum of \u201CHow\
    \ easy can you make something before it doesn't make sense anymore?\u201D If you\
    \ try to make it so much easier, then you're not helping anyone. But if you make\
    \ it too complex, then you're leaving out everyone else. So it's usually a battle.\
    \ But it's a nice battle to fight. It\u2019s something that I enjoy for sure."

- header: Seven lessons I learned about starting a career in machine learning
- line: "Speaking of Twitter \u2013 just before this conversation, I opened Twitter.\
    \ I just wanted to check what you've been up to. I noticed this nice thread, which\
    \ is the very topic of today's conversation. It\u2019s about \u201CSeven lessons\
    \ I learned about starting a career in machine learning.\u201D Do you remember\
    \ what these seven lessons are?"
  sec: 971
  time: '16:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can have it in front of me right now. I remember some of them. Yeah, I think
    I have it right here.
  sec: 995
  time: '16:35'
  who: Santiago
- line: So maybe you can walk us through these lessons a bit? I think these lessons
    are very useful for software engineers who want to transition today.
  sec: 1006
  time: '16:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, absolutely. First of all, the context. This is trying to do a little\
    \ bit of a retrospective on myself \u2013 on how I got into the field and the\
    \ things that I learned. Also it\u2019s about being focused this year on helping\
    \ people get into the field. It\u2019s just looking at the questions they ask,\
    \ looking at the problems they've had, and what we can learn from that."
  sec: 1015
  time: '16:55'
  who: Santiago
- header: "Lesson 1 \u2013 Take the first step"
- line: "The first lesson applies to a bunch of different things, not only machine\
    \ learning. Most people really enjoy the idea of starting something. Unfortunately,\
    \ they fail to take the first step. For example, you decide that you want to make\
    \ a change in your life. You want to go to the gym, you start buying supplements,\
    \ and you start buying shorts and shoes and so on. That process is really exciting.\
    \ But you never show up \u2013 you never go to the gym, right? So the lesson here\
    \ is \u2013 don't be like that person. Don't prepare forever. You don't need that\
    \ much preparation. You just need to take the first step. You just need to do\
    \ something today that gets you a little bit closer to that job. I think that's\
    \ the first lesson."
  sec: 1045
  time: '17:25'
  who: Santiago
- line: "It's like buying a course about machine learning and getting excited. \u201C\
    Hey, I will finish this course and know so much.\u201D And then you come across\
    \ the second one. But this is even cooler, let's learn this one as well. And then\
    \ there\u2019s the third one. And there\u2019s a cool free course, too. And then\
    \ there is a book somebody recommends you. And you want to get through all of\
    \ them, right? But at the end, you just collect the resources and don't do anything\
    \ with them."
  sec: 1093
  time: '18:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That is exactly right. Most people spend so much time trying to find the\
    \ best course, trying to find the best tutorial, the best video. There is no best\
    \ tutorial. There is no best course. Whatever you have in your bookmarks is plenty\
    \ enough. Go through that and then decide what's going to be better for you. But\
    \ just stop preparing \u2013 you just need to take the first step."

  who: Santiago
- header: "Lesson 2 \u2013 Learning is a marathon, not a sprint"
- line: "The second lesson is \u201CLearning is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201D I\
    \ get a lot of questions from people asking me, \u201CHey, can I become an expert\
    \ in a few weeks\u201D or \u201CIn a year?\u201D or \u201CIn a month? The reality\
    \ is that machine learning is no different than any other field. It's a lifelong\
    \ journey. Machine learning has been selected for the last few years as \u201C\
    the sexiest field to be in\u201D and stuff like that. People want to get into\
    \ the field because they think it's a shortcut to success or they think they're\
    \ going to be making a lot of money. That mentality \u2013 I don't see it helping.\
    \ If you're coming into the field, you need to understand what you're setting\
    \ yourself up for. Understand that this is a lifelong journey \u2013 it\u2019\
    s a field that moves really, really fast and you're going to have to keep up.\
    \ You're going to have to dedicate a lot of time to become good at it.  So just\
    \ set the right expectations for yourself when you\u2019re about to start in the\
    \ field."

  sec: 1222
  time: '20:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. There is no magic and there are no shortcuts. It is hard. It's super
    rewarding and it's easy to start, but it's going to be a lifelong effort for sure.

    \ far, go together."
- line: "Lesson number three, is basically a proverb that I used, which is \u201C\
    If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201D\
    \ Here, the idea is that the people that I've seen make the most progress are\
    \ always part of a community. They are always part of a group. It is really hard\
    \ to make progress when you are alone. So find like-minded people that want to\
    \ take this journey with. There is a huge online machine learning community \u2013\
    \ just try to be there with them. Try to join. Try to find other people that want\
    \ to bounce ideas off of you and vice versa. Try to find people that are taking\
    \ the same classes as you are. That will boost your odds significantly. You're\
    \ gonna make a ton of progress just because of that. In my case, my teaching is\
    \ one of the most powerful ways I have to learn."
  sec: 1238
  time: '20:38'
  who: Santiago
- line: So I come here and I'm not only writing about stuff that I know. A bunch of
    stuff that I've talked about on Twitter is stuff where I don't know what I'm talking
    about. I just read about it and the process of writing about it is the way that
    I learned it. That's thanks to the community that gives me feedback and challenges
    my ideas. That's extremely important if you're trying to get into the field.
  who: Santiago
- header: "Lesson 4 \u2013 Do something with the knowledge you gain"
- line: "Lesson number four. If you finish a course and the only thing you have to\
    \ show for it is inside your head, you probably wasted your time. Here, the idea\
    \ is \u2013 you have to do stuff, not just consume information. You have to produce\
    \ something. If you're watching a tutorial, do something with it. If you're reading\
    \ a book, stop after the first chapter and think \u201CHow can I apply what I\
    \ learned?\u201D If you don't do that, you are unfortunately going to forget it.\
    \ Even if the doing means going to Twitter and talking about it \u2013 that is\
    \ doing something. That's the act of taking that knowledge and applying it somehow.\
    \ That is extremely, extremely important. If you're not doing stuff with the knowledge\
    \ that you're acquiring, the knowledge is not going to stay for long."
  sec: 1338
  time: '22:18'
  who: Santiago
- line: "When you were writing about these ensemble methods, you would test what you\
    \ wrote on your wife. So I guess this is a great example of how you can actually\
    \ apply this. When you learn something or when you\u2019re studying something,\
    \ try to teach some other person about it \u2013 talk to your wife or somebody\
    \ else. And if they understand, then that\u2019s a lot better than just reading\
    \ a post or a book and not doing anything with this information."

  time: '23:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Absolutely. There\u2019s one thing that I've been doing now that Twitter\
    \ supports Twitter Spaces. Basically, you get the microphone and a bunch of people\
    \ join you and you can get to talk to a bunch of people. I've done Twitter Spaces\
    \ to talk about a topic that I just learned, just so I can explain it to someone\
    \ else. A bunch of people join and they ask me questions and test what I learned.\
    \ Therefore, I have to get prepared to do that. That preparation forces me to\
    \ solidify that learning \u2013 to understand it a little bit better. That's extremely\
    \ powerful."

- line: I've been doing it very regularly. Usually I do it once per week. Sometimes
    I join somebody else's Space and I talk about the stuff that I'm learning or whatever.
    Sometimes I do my own Space and talk about a specific topic.
  sec: 1461

    transition. Let's say I am a software engineer. I know how to program. I know
    Java. I know SQL. I know how to use Git. I know Bash. Maybe I know Docker. All
    these things. And I hear about machine learning, it seems like a cool thing. So,
    what are the core tools and frameworks? Yes, I watched this video and I get convinced
    that I don't need to get deep into math. I want to start coding and get my hands
    dirty. What are the core tools and frameworks that I need to learn to do this?
  sec: 1990
  time: '33:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, absolutely. Great question. I think, number one, you should start learning
    a little bit of Python. Since you already know Java, I don't think it's going
    to be a huge transition for you. It's going to be very simple. Not because Python
    is the same as Java, but in a week, you're gonna get a lot of the differences
    there. You're gonna be able to make some progress. That's number one.
  sec: 2027
  time: '33:47'
  who: Santiago
- line: Then you get certain core tools that are going to be used throughout your
    entire career. Those would be NumPy for scientific computing. That's a library
    on Pandas for data manipulation. And Matplotlib and Seaborn and Plotly. Those
    three, or one of those three, for charting and displaying graphics. Then you get
    SciKit Learn for the collection of machine learning algorithms. Those are tools
    that you're going to have to be using. I do not recommend just going and learning
    about them out of the blue. Instead, I would recommend you to go to maybe Kaggle,
    or maybe take a course online. We can talk about specific courses later. Take
    one of those courses that are going to start introducing you to some problems
    and to some core ideas of machine learning.
  who: Santiago
- line: "There is a course in Kaggle which is an introduction. I don't remember the\
    \ name, but if you go to Kaggle, they have tutorials there for free. One of them\
    \ is an introductory course that takes you through the Titanic problem in Kaggle\
    \ \u2013 one of the most famous competitions there. What's good about it is that\
    \ the only requirement for you is to know Python. They're going to present a problem\
    \ and tell you how to use decision trees to solve that specific problem. I think\
    \ that process is extremely powerful, because you go from no machine learning\
    \ background, to understanding what the problem is and why you cannot solve it\
    \ with what you know right now, which is straight software engineering practices.\
    \ Why you need something like a decision tree, how to build it, how to apply it,\
    \ how to get results. That line there is exactly what I recommend people to start\
    \ getting into the industry. First, understand why you would need this."

    \ solve it and then start getting deeper. Later on, you can get into decision\
    \ trees and understand all of the nuts and bolts behind the scenes, and all the\
    \ math, and all the other cool stuff. But at the beginning, just learning how\
    \ to use it \u2013 it is extremely powerful. So that's what I would do."

    \ it was some problem from Kaggle about this Titanic dataset, and you just learn\
    \ how to solve this problem using a specific tool, like decision trees from SciKit\
    \ Learn."

    \ Then when you know the math, you go to machine learning theory and you learn\
    \ the theory. Then four years later, you finally come to applications, \u201C\

    \ years understanding the math behind electricity and the physics and all of that,\
    \ just to change an outlet. I would rather start with the outlet and find a YouTube\
    \ video that helps me go through the problem. If I'm interested, then I can go\

    we talked about how to approach machine learning also apply here. You don't just
    go and read a book about the cloud. Instead, you think first about the problem
    and then you try to solve this problem with the cloud? Right? So you focus on
    the problem first. Otherwise, the cloud is such a big topic. It's not possible

    \ learning is one of the tools there. But there are other tools. For example,\
    \ if you're solving a problem with data science, you don't always need to go and\
