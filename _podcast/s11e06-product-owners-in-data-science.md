title: Product Owners in Data Science
transcript:
- header: About Anna and METRO
- line: This week, we'll talk about product owners in data science. We have a special
    guest day, Anna. Anna is a domain owner for Data Science at METRO.digital, where
    she drives adoption of data science and AI topics within the METRO business. And
    METRO is a large… What do you call it?
  sec: 92
  time: '1:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Wholesaler.
  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Anna
- line: Wholesaler. Okay. So, supermarkets, right? [chuckles] Previously Anna led
    product teams in areas of recommender systems, robotics, and smart logistics.
    In this conversation, Anna will share her experience working as a product owner.
    Welcome, Anna.
  sec: 113
  time: '1:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi, Alexey. As you asked me, maybe to elaborate a little bit. First of all,
    METRO is a wholesaler. Sometimes you think it's very similar to retail – in some
    aspects, yes, and in some others, no. The difference we have here is just that
    our customers are B2B. It's not like just you and me come in there and buy something,
    but  in many situations, we expect hotels, restaurants, and caterers to be our
    customers. But you're talking about data science, so we also expect changes in
    the behavior of a customer, for example. It's very difficult to inspire them to
    buy or try out new things. If you imagine a restaurant like a pizzeria – it has
    these five types of pizza, it will not start buying cherries all of a sudden.
  sec: 129
  time: '2:09'
  who: Anna
- line: Cherries on a pizza. That would be interesting.
  sec: 181
  time: '3:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] So that is a really a special challenge for the recommender systems.
    So, I''m a so-called domain owner, responsible for all data science projects and
    initiatives at METRO, in the area of data science.'
  sec: 185
  time: '3:05'
  who: Anna
- line: There were so many times that I tried to get into a METRO store, because it's
    usually cheaper, but the security wouldn't let me in. Because you're doing B2B,
    they always wanted proof that I am a business owner, so I always needed to go
    with somebody who has this proof. [chuckles] Sometimes I actually, when I lived
    in Poland, they had a MAKRO store, which is also METRO under another name, right?
    [Anna agrees] So I managed to sneak in sometimes without any documents. Those
    were adventurous times. [laughs]
  sec: 200
  time: '3:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a great point that you bring up considering that we're talking today
    to the community. You can think about it like how all people try to get this personalized
    data – we have it directly. We really know every transaction from the beginning
    of METRO’s existence is assigned to a customer. So we always know “Anna has been
    buying those five milks on that day and time.” And as a picture, it’s complete.
    Many times other companies try to have all the loyalty programs with paybacks
    and you name it – for sure they're doing it to collect data, but many times there's
    a certain piece of society who never applies for such programs and you have just
    a subset. In our case, it's complete and that is always what I try to sell as
    an advantage for everyone who applied for a job at METRO, like “Look, you have
    direct data to start working with.”
  sec: 234
  time: '3:54'
  who: Anna
- header: Anna’s background
- line: That's cool. You can’t do data science without data, right? So the main topic
    for today is product owners and data science. But before discussing that, I wanted
    to ask you about your career so far. So can you tell us about what you've been
    doing so far? What has your career journey been like?
  sec: 289
  time: '4:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, I’m more than happy to share it. I originally studied computer science.
    Then, in my PhD, I was focusing on – back then it was called data mining, today,
    we call it data science – and I was focusing on web science. You represent the
    community as a network, and you try to analyze what makes the networks more healthy
    or less healthy, and you apply different clustering and classification algorithms
    to aid that. Then, as I said, you try to say what drives the community to grow
    or to decline. I was doing this research in this area of open source projects,
    which is pretty interesting to see – why one open source project evolves and evaluates
    and others just decline.
  sec: 309
  time: '5:09'
  who: Anna
- line: That's pretty interesting. I also happen to run a community, which is pretty
    relevant to what you're saying. So do you still have some of your research in
    open access?
  sec: 357
  time: '5:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I assume my PhD should be accessible online, because it’s the general regulation
    in Germany. Nevertheless, what I can say about the key point is – you observe
    this Pareto distribution very strongly. It's not 80/20. In the open source community,
    it's like 90/10. You really have this very small portion of core developers who
    are really making a difference and you have many people who just drop a message
    once, maybe submit a bug report. So it's a very, very long tail and a very dense
    core.
  sec: 372
  time: '6:12'
  who: Anna
- line: Back then, for example, I was comparing three projects that were trying to
    do the same thing. It was BioPerl, BioJava, and Biopython, which are extensions
    of the corresponding languages – Python, Java, and Perl – in order to do some
    bioinformatics. You would say, “The application is the same, the community people
    should be the same.” And one of the findings was, you have to have a strong interlayer.
    It shouldn't be that steep, like you have three people in the core and just the
    long tail. You have to have those who are here and they are more active.
  sec: 372
  time: '6:12'
  who: Anna
- line: If you're just relying on your core – those three to five very central people
    – once one of them drops out, you have a really big problem. If you have a strong
    interlayer – something in the middle – there's a high chance that someone from
    this interlayer will jump in and close this gap. It's not only that. I was able
    to prove it with data, but I have to say that all these communities were so open.
    I reached out to them and was asking questions, like, “Look, that is what I see
    in the data.” They really shared their stories, saying “Yeah. We have observed
    that. When that person leaves the community, it really goes down with progress
    and so on and people get demotivated.” So I even got a lot of not only quantitative,
    but also qualitative, commitments to what I have found.
  sec: 372
  time: '6:12'
  who: Anna
- line: Yeah. If anyone who is listening is interested in doing some of this kind
    of research, and you want to get some data from DataTalks.Club, please reach out.
    That would be quite interesting to try. I've also heard about a rule called the
    “90-9-1 rule” where you have a 90, which are people who are silent, 9 who are
    active, and then 1 is this core. I think this is very similar to what you mentioned.
  sec: 500
  time: '8:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sounds like it to me too. But coming back to my biography – I finished
    the PhD in this area, but I was always kind of interested in structuring and organizing
    things. That is why I first went to Zalando, where I was responsible for smart
    logistics, automation of the warehouses – the warehouse that’s a warehouse, not
    a data warehouse, but the physical one where you store the items on shelves and
    then you do the picking/packing and then it's transported. I assume for the people
    who are listening to us. For example, one of the tasks was the picking process,
    which is very time consuming and also a workforce-consuming one.
  sec: 525
  time: '8:45'
  who: Anna
- line: There was a machine constructed to automate the process and I was responsible
    for the integration of this automated machine into the processes. Because you
    still have the workforce, which is running around doing some manual picking, plus
    this automatic machine – so there are two flows, which go apart and you have to
    bring them together as a packing station, since now you have to bring everything
    together. At some point in time, Zalando also signed contracts for AWS, so we
    were doing, like someone said, “Yeah, we need to develop a new piece of software
    for the warehouse’s automatic machine anyways. Let's go directly for micro services
    on AWS.”
  sec: 525
  time: '8:45'
  who: Anna
- line: So I had these two hats – to streamline that process with the task force team
    to transition AWS microservices, and to integrate this machine. I think that was
    a very important experience for my life because it was very execution-driven.
    Literally, if you're working very close to this operation, you can imagine that
    behind every delay, someone can put some amount of money that you are losing,
    for example, if the machine is not working. You can put a dollar/euro amount behind
    every package that is not sent out on time. I learned to work under very high
    pressure. And don't get me wrong, I’m complaining – I really enjoyed it. But just
    to give you a number – in the warehouse where I was working at the time, we had
    up to 2000 workers. Maybe not everyone relied on the machine, but even if you
    say it's a thousand workers who are not able to work because the system is down,
    you know how much you pay each of them for every minute. Because we are in Germany,
    no one will send you home saying “You have nothing to do, we're not paying you.”
    The people are still there and sitting and just playing around.
  sec: 525
  time: '8:45'
  who: Anna
- line: There was, really, the management of this warehouse coming to me and saying
    “Yet another minute. Yet another minute. What does this mean in terms of customer
    satisfaction and also money that we're losing?” From there, I moved to METRO,
    where I was a product manager for recommender systems. I guess that very strongly
    formed what I am and how we managed to really go from this POC situation that
    you're facing a lot in data science, to really having it as a product. I came
    from a very strong, driven “Deliver, deploy every day, there's so much dependency.”
    And then I come to the area of data science, which feels like research. I came
    and said, “No, no, no. We’re trying to take the best things we know from computer
    science and somehow put it together with things we need to do in data science.”
    And I really do believe that we were successful. And I really do believe that
    we have to use product management approaches for developing successful data science
    products, which are then in production.
  sec: 525
  time: '8:45'
  who: Anna
- line: So you studied computer science – you studied data mining and web science.
    Do you think it helped you with what you're doing right now?
  sec: 769
  time: '12:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I do think so. I still think that in a management position in data and
    tech, you need to have people with a data tech background. I really do think that
    it matters a lot for my direction. I can understand the language they speak and
    I can also understand why, for example, research here and they – that’s still
    important. It also gives a certain respect, but also, I'm then able to go and
    advocate for their needs. It's not just for me “blah, blah, I do not understand
    this,” it’s like, “Okay, I got your points,” and I go back to the stakeholders
    and say, “Look, people need more time,” or “The data is not sufficient,” or “There
    is a limitation of infrastructure.”
  sec: 779
  time: '12:59'
  who: Anna
- header: The importance of a technical background for data product owners
- line: Do you think product owners and product managers – we will actually talk about
    what those terms mean – but I'm wondering whether you think they should have technical
    background or not? Or is it just a “nice” thing to have?
  sec: 830
  time: '13:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: I guess it depends. I also know some product owners who do not have a technical
    background, who are really great people. So I guess soft skills are also very
    important. Also, customer understanding, or customer obsession, can really make
    sense and make a difference. However, I guess it still depends because there are,
    for example, very technical products. One example would be – at METRO, out of
    data science, we have cloud foundation, which is a product about giving you a
    piece of cloud infrastructure.
  sec: 841
  time: '14:01'
  who: Anna
- line: I guess you have to be a very technical product manager, otherwise you will
    not understand what it's all about. You can then also not be that passionate about
    it. If we are talking more about really customer-facing things – end customer-facing
    – then you really can connect yourself with the end customers and say “I'm passionate
    about this product because I am an active user of this app.” So maybe it's not
    that sufficient.
  sec: 841
  time: '14:01'
  who: Anna
- header: What are product owners?
- line: So what do product owners actually do? Who are they?
  sec: 911
  time: '15:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: First of all, maybe the question is “What is the difference between product
    owners and product managers? I guess it could also be the definition. [cross-talk]
  sec: 918
  time: '15:18'
  who: Anna
- line: What I was saying was “Who are product owners?” It's also interesting to see
    the comparison – you mentioned that you joined METRO as a product manager, but
    I think your title is “product owner,” right?
  sec: 930
  time: '15:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: My title today is Domain Owner. Now I'm given the stage app. Back then it
    was Product Owner. Again, we have readjustments to product managers, and I guess
    in Zalando, it was the other way around. I see that it’s not that clear of a distinction
    and maybe someone can write to us in the chat. But I have experienced it a lot
    in companies where you really don't know what the difference is. Today it’s Product
    Manager, and then there's some restructuring, and its Product Owner. For me, because
    I’m sometimes asked by friends, “Okay, coach me. What do I need to do to be a
    product manager?” So that is my personal definition.
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Anna
- line: I guess the most important thing is to be able to make decisions. That's what
    I learned. For sure, the stressful situation was a warehouse, where it's about
    sending the next 1000 items out or not – it's really a very strong decision you
    have to make. But even in data science, every time, you need to make a decision.
    Your data scientists will come and say, “Hmm. The model itself is good. But maybe
    if you give us two more weeks, we can try to improve it a lot.” For example, being
    brave enough to say, “I believe it's now good enough. I'm clearly communicating
    the quality to the stakeholders, but now is the time to go live.” This ability
    to be brave enough to make decisions is really something that’s very needed to
    be a good product owner/product manager.
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Anna
- line: Then there’s being passionate about what you're doing – really loving it –
    because what I see for me, as a product owner, is someone who sits between stakeholders
    and the developers (or data scientists). So on one hand, it’s a translator from
    requirements to the team, but it's also an advocate and a shield for the people.
    So it's someone who really protects the team in the sense that something like
    the expectations are not right. How often have I had these discussions like, “How
    about you take one person and it's ready tomorrow?” [chuckles] That is also the
    product manager who sits in between and says, “No, we need this and that because
    the process requires this.” Take a very good example with data science, where
    people say something like, “Take one FT (one person) and solve the problem.”
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Anna
- line: What does FT stand for?
  sec: 1102
  time: '18:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Something like a resource. You can Google, I don't know. [chuckles] Then I
    am the one who goes and negotiates and says, “You need someone who will orchestrate
    the whole machine learning flow. You need one data scientist. You need some DevOps
    or maybe a data engineer.” And it's not right that you just say, “Here, you take
    it from there and you, data scientists, do it now.” To summarize – being able
    to make decisions and risk, to protect your team, to be a good interpreter from
    stakeholders to your team, and then from team back to the stakeholders, and last
    but not least, being really passionate about what you're doing.
  sec: 1105
  time: '18:25'
  who: Anna
- line: What you described right now is a product owner, product manager, or both?
  sec: 1146
  time: '19:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it's the product owner. I guess people put more execution into the
    product manager role. A product owner is more like the CEO of their product. So,
    I tend more to be on the product owner side.
  sec: 1153
  time: '19:13'
  who: Anna
- line: By “execution” you mean… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1168
  time: '19:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Because a product manager I guess, is the one who does more managing – streamlines
    the process, takes less ownership. So that is where I see the difference.
  sec: 1170
  time: '19:30'
  who: Anna
- line: So this is what you mean by “execution,” right? Meaning they manage the process,
    making sure the team is working fine – all these rituals like scrum sprints, estimating
    – all these things are usually done by product managers?
  sec: 1182
  time: '19:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: You still have agile coaches or scrum coaches or whatever they’re called today
    to follow up with the rituals. But I guess in a nutshell, and as I said, there's
    not always much of a difference. It depends on who you ask. But in my eyes, product
    owners are like the CEO of a product, while product managers maybe have less power,
    and maybe have to listen more to the tech lead and the teams. But I'm more than
    happy to hear what the audience thinks.
  sec: 1200
  time: '20:00'
  who: Anna
- header: Product owners vs product managers
- line: I'm just curious. I did work with product owners. In some companies, they
    have only product owners, while some companies have only product managers. In
    the company where I work right now, OLX, we have only product managers – we don't
    have product owners. I'm just wondering, in this case – if there is no product
    owner officially in the team – then the product manager wears this hat, right?
    [Anna agrees] So they make these decisions, like you said, “Okay, we need to ship
    it now,” or “We need to wait for two more weeks.” Also, you mentioned that product
    managers work together with tech leads, right?
  sec: 1234
  time: '20:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Correct.
  sec: 1276
  time: '21:16'
  who: Anna
- line: So they both can be owners at the end.
  sec: 1277
  time: '21:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Owners, correct. And in your company, Alexey, what is then the next in line?
    To whom do the product managers report?
  sec: 1280
  time: '21:20'
  who: Anna
- line: Head of Product.
  sec: 1289
  time: '21:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Head of product. Okay, in our case, it’s like Domain Owners. But again, that's
    just the naming.
  sec: 1290
  time: '21:30'
  who: Anna
- line: In the chat, I see that FTE stands for Full Time Equivalent, or Full Time
    Employee.
  sec: 1297
  time: '21:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Full Time Employee. Yeah. Normally, I have these discussions a lot,
    like, “Can we have the budget for one person, but this one person can cover three
    use cases from data science?” Then it's part of the task also of the product owner
    to say “No, it's not doable.” And explain why.
  sec: 1305
  time: '21:45'
  who: Anna
- header: Anna’s work on recommender systems at METRO
- line: I think you described, more or less, what you did. You said that you were
    taking care of recommender systems at METRO digital. So what did you do there
    as a product owner? How did you exactly “take care of recommender systems”?
  sec: 1328
  time: '22:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I joined METRO, there were like one and a half people [chuckles] more
    or less. It was more a kind of research environment. I mean, we were getting requests
    here and there from a dedicated country, which  now plans to have a campaign in
    the next month and they say “Okay, there’s also products that we would love to
    put on a special offer. To whom should we send out a newsletter?” And that was
    pretty manual, because it was like – you get this list of products, which maybe
    were somewhere in the database, but it was like manual. “Here's a product. Here's
    the target groups we would love to face.” There was collaborative filtering in
    between but it was really – there were requests, manual processing, and the results
    generated and, again, shared, written somewhere in the database. When I came up,
    I said “Okay. This doesn't scale.”
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Anna
- line: With this, first of all, how many people should we hire? Back then we were
    operating in 25 countries, and meanwhile, we are in 23. But otherwise it's like
    you have this highly paid data scientist spending half of their time actually
    exchanging emails back and forth, “Which group should be picked?” And just clicking
    on a button waiting until this was calculated. And I went and said “No, no. I
    want to have a use case where we clearly serve an API and we do real software
    development here (as I was used to from Zalando).” So firstly, we introduced the
    whole agile setup – with stand ups, with two week sprints (where we tried to really
    set a goal for two weeks). In terms of processes, we changed it a lot, but also
    in terms of our target group.
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Anna
- line: To be honest, we still support the use case of the newsletter, but we automated
    it a lot and dedicated the support of two people who do nothing but this execution.
    I said clearly, “Okay, where are the use cases where we can use the endpoint?”
    And that is for sure our online shop. So as you go to the online shop, you're
    looking at a banana, for example, and underneath, there’s a “frequently bought
    together” field – so people who were buying bananas are also interested in this
    and that. So I said, “That's great. We just provide them an endpoint, and they
    integrate in it.” Back then I guess (METRO online shop) was present in like 10
    countries. Then they went up to 12. Then they went up to 18. For us, because we
    trained our model already for all 25 countries, every country that went live –
    we were already live there. How great is that? So that was really scaling.
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Anna
- line: Then there was just one flow created (one ML flow), there was an API, we were
    able to set Datadog on it, to see how reliable it is. We also didn't take care
    of anything – our endpoint just says, “Okay, given a product and the customers
    who are looking at it, what are the best six frequently bought together products?”
    So we just submit the results in the form of IDs and that the rest of this is
    the responsibility of the customer-facing solution to grab the right pictures,
    descriptions, and the right price. That is also great, because then, you as a
    data science team, really focus on the core task. You're not trying to see “Okay,
    do I have a description (or whatever)? Can I consider the results complete?” Because
    many times if you just do the manual process, you're consuming party stats, but
    you’re also thinking “Yeah, can you also search for the pictures and submit the
    results with the pictures?” Or whatever. So this example is one where we also
    took a clear step.
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Anna
- line: Then we extended our portfolio of events to alternative recommendations. That
    one is – if you're looking at a product and it's not available (because we don't
    want our customers to be disappointed) Alexey you said in the beginning that you
    have been to METRO so you know it has a huge assortment. Normally, if you don't
    have this dedicated milk, there are at least 50 other milk types that will have
    the same percentage of fat, the same size, and everything else. So it really makes
    sense just to propose a reasonable alternative to do it in a personalized manner.
    So that is another one. Once something’s out of stock, it says “We have the following
    alternatives for you.”
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Anna
- line: And last but not least was the recommender. Again, when we started, I told
    you “Okay, give the special offers to whom it's relevant.” And the whole time
    I was thinking, “But I get more out of it. I get more out of it. Newsletters are
    a manual process, but where can make it more automatic?” And it's our app – we
    have M Companion, which is an app of METRO. You go there and there’s several tabs
    and one tab is a special offer. It was just that all products that are under offer
    were listed there. Let’s say, for example, you have a vegan restaurant that doesn’t
    sell any meat, but because we have meat as a special offer, you're getting meat
    on the top. I guess many customers got kind of pissed, like “Why are you offering
    it to me? It's not relevant.” Here, we applied it like – every time the offers
    are updated, we take the offers and we train our model to whom 200 top recommenders
    rank in the order of relevance per customer. When you go to this app, and click
    on “offers,” your list will be different from mine.

  who: Anna
- line: And again, M Companion rolls out to a new country, here we are – it's an endpoint,
    it's directly solved, we can update it, we are independent, we can run an A/B
    test without creating any problems. That is the approach that I would recommend
    everyone to do.
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Anna
- line: So you mentioned three use cases. First is a newsletter – so all the clients
    of METRO receive newsletters with personalized recommendations. I think you said
    that you segment first, and then each segment gets the same newsletter, more or
    less, right?
  sec: 1745
  time: '29:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no, no. It's really personalized. It's a really customer-focused product.
    You can, so why not?
  sec: 1763
  time: '29:23'
  who: Anna
- line: Okay. Then you have the online shop, where you have a recommender system.
    And then finally, in the app. So three places.
  sec: 1769
  time: '29:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. But I would actually count it as because “alternative recommender” and
    “frequently bought together” are really two different recommenders. One is cross
    sell – I try to encourage you to buy more, so it’s really saying like “You're
    looking at a banana, also buy an apple.” Whereas the alternative is just, “You're
    looking at bananas. These bananas are not available, take another banana.”
  sec: 1777
  time: '29:37'
  who: Anna
- header: Expanding the data team
- line: Okay. I'm just curious. You said that when you joined METRO, there were “one
    and a half people” and then you said that you need software engineers, you need
    agile processes, etc. So who was on the team and who did you need to hire?
  sec: 1801
  time: '30:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's a very great learning experience. I always love to share it. So
    I started first on the role list. Our very first position description, we were
    looking for people with PhDs in mathematics and statistics. I still do believe
    you need those, don't get me wrong. But the question was about the amount. It
    depends on how far you are in the process – sometimes you're still in POC and
    trying things out, but once you're pretty ready with the model and you are just
    improving it, it's enough to have one data scientist per use case, maybe.
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Anna
- line: We pretty quickly recognized that if you really want to do this productionized
    software, something which runs into production, as I said, 24/7 – where we have
    the whole infrastructure, the Datadog, the ML flow, and so on –we need real engineers
    (today they’re called machine learning engineers and sometimes MLOps – depends
    a little) I would say from today's perspective, you need both roles and it's a
    little different, because ML flow is really like “How do you structure the flow?
    Some tail, bring it there, retrain, risk, and so on,” while MLOps is being able
    to create an ideal infrastructure for machine learning projects. Sometimes I get
    asked, “Okay, what is the ratio?” Again, depending on how far you are in the prod
    process. At the beginning, you can start with one to one.
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Anna
- line: So that’s one ML engineer one and one MLOps and one data scientist?
  sec: 1920
  time: '32:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, and one data scientist. That should be your basis. But once you're going
    more and more into production – and, as I said, there may be just some improvements
    of your model, but it's also all about being stable and running – then it can
    be up to three engineers for one data scientist.
  sec: 1923
  time: '32:03'
  who: Anna
- line: Okay. Let's say you don't have money for three people – who will you hire
    first?
  sec: 1944
  time: '32:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Again, it depends where I''m staying. If it''s really a completely
    new use case, it may be data scientists. Ideally, I would go for a generalist.
    So, again, if someone listening now to us [cross-talk]'
  sec: 1951
  time: '32:31'
  who: Anna
- line: Full-stack, right?
  sec: 1965
  time: '32:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, if you really want to be the kind of the person everyone wants to have,
    try to evolve yourself to the generalist role – someone who can at least set up
    some basic infrastructure, create some ML flow plus being interested and understanding
    data science. That is where I would start. I can also be very honest with our
    audience, because I guess it's not a secret – for some initiatives, when I don't
    know if I should hire someone-long term, I would also reach out to some external
    support. With external support, you can reduce and increase pretty dynamically.
    Once I know “Okay, that is something I would love to go for.” The business really
    shows. It's not like I say it. Maybe let me take it back. If you really see that
    it improves the business and there is a potential, then we go to hire people.
  sec: 1966
  time: '32:46'
  who: Anna
- line: There's another approach we also use and it may also be a recommendation towards
    our audience. I found that many people – today I have already 22 directs – are
    always willing to learn something new. You can also ask around in just the existing
    resources, if they would love to have something like 20% commitment, or maybe
    even 50% commitment, for the next three months to run a POC. It’s a great thing
    to give back to your people, just to say “Look, that's another use case.” That
    is also something they can put on their CV. They can say “I was creating a model
    for recommenders and markdown.” That's what we have done, so maybe someone who
    participated in both is listening now. And I got really great feedback from people,
    like “Oh! I learned a completely new piece of data, a business partner, (and so
    on, so on.)” Then after you have done it in this setup, you can then say “Okay,
    those are the people I need,” and you decide whether you hire or you relocate.

- header: Types of algorithms used for recommender systems
- line: There is a question from Valeria, “What kind of recommender systems (or probably
    algorithms) did you use? Was it collaborative filtering or was it different for
    each of the use cases you had?”
  sec: 2093
  time: '34:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's different for each of the use cases. Collaborative filtering we
    were using for scoring already. Let me be clear here – it’s been one and a half
    years that I've been in this domain owner position and not working that case.
    Maybe my information won't be up to date. But we also used a modification of Word2Vec
    to find combinations from people – to become able to score the relevance of products
    to people.
  sec: 2103
  time: '35:03'
  who: Anna
- line: This Word2Vec is for things that are frequently bought together? Like apples
    and bananas?
  sec: 2138
  time: '35:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, correct. There is a special modification. Normally you would expect that
    it tries to use semantics, but that's also like learning semantics out of your
    transactional data.
  sec: 2145
  time: '35:45'
  who: Anna
- header: What kind of knowledge and skills data product owners need to have
- line: Did you actually need to get into technical details for all that as a product
    owner? Did you need to know that, “Okay, this is this specific Word2Vec modification?”
    Or was it something that you just wanted to learn because of your background?
  sec: 2155
  time: '35:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: You should understand the basics and you should be able to challenge it with
    the right questions. For example, what we have done and kind of experimented at
    a certain point of time. You know how people who have done a PhD in mathematics,
    or statistics, or computer science – they got used to reading some scientific
    papers. And there are great scientific papers outside. Here and there was always
    a situation of someone coming and saying “Over the weekend, I was reading this
    paper. I think it's a great idea. Let's try it out.” I really wanted to show that
    I value this ambition, and this time investment. But I also didn't want us to
    jump on every new paper, like, “Let's implement it!” So one of the learnings was,
    at some point, we created just a basic table in Confluence, where we were collecting
    all these ideas. So you place a link to the paper and you write a short summary.
    But the important thing was that there were two columns – one column asking “What
    is it good for? Is it good for making a good collation quicker? Or is it good
    for improving the quality (improves accuracy)?”
  sec: 2171
  time: '36:11'
  who: Anna
- line: Coming back to your question, it is very important that you understand that
    you can ask these questions and challenge people. It sometimes gives really good
    feedback to the people – they recognize, “Oh, you're right. It’ll only speed up
    the process.” And you say, “Okay, now we train a model once a week. Do we even
    need to speed it up? Will it make a difference? Today it runs for two hours, and
    then it will run for one hour and a half. Will it influence the business?” And
    then people are like, “Okay, you're right. It will not.” So I don't think that
    I have to understand (or any product manager has to understand) in very great
    detail. But you have to understand data science principles and what it’s about,
    what it means. What does a metric mean? What does quality mean? What does any
    other type of improvement mean?
  sec: 2171
  time: '36:11'
  who: Anna
- line: Now you work as the data science domain owner. How is it different from a
    product owner? I think you answered that question, right? You are now a manager
    of product owners, right?
  sec: 2312
  time: '38:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah… no, no, no, wait. There’s a difference. It's not like a Head of Product
    – it's a Head of Data Science people. So the people who have the role of Data
    Scientists or Data Analysts do report to me, but they are then part of a product
    team. And product people do report to the Head of Product.
  sec: 2325
  time: '38:45'
  who: Anna
- line: Okay, so it's like the Head of Data Science in our case.
  sec: 2349
  time: '39:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, Head of Data Science within an engineering organization. The idea is
    that I am kind of sitting there in the middle, so I can ensure that we are not
    doing the same thing five times because it's somehow streamlined over my head.
    I also play an umbrella. I bring the data scientists from this team together with
    data scientists from this team and say “Look, it seems that you're doing similar
    stuff, maybe you should exchange ideas, or maybe just support each other. And
    I can enable what I just described – this rotation –to say “Alexey, we have a
    new initiative in markdown. Do you want to try it out?”
  sec: 2353

  sec: 2405

    like that – in addition to knowing all these domains?
  sec: 2406
  time: '40:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's a lot. A certain amount of understanding is still required – people
    do expect me to be able to answer things like “You’re the data science expert.
    Tell us.” We have eight big data science cases, and they're really a broad range.
    Even though I have a great focus on recommenders, where I can also go in great
    detail because it's where I originally came from, but as I said, we have a markdown
    initiative, like “What is the optimal discount given the expiration date of this
    product?”
  sec: 2416
  time: '40:16'
  who: Anna
- line: We also even give credits. I don't know if you know about it, but at METRO,
    as a big customer, you can get a loan like you would get in a bank. For this we
    do credit scoring. It's completely new – another area. We’re also trying to do
    some dynamic pricing, and we do assortment optimization. It's challenging to be
    up to date everywhere, but as I said, I try. I try hard plus I assume I know what
    questions to ask.
  sec: 2416
  time: '40:16'
  who: Anna
- header: METRO’s markdown system
- line: What does markdown mean? Because in my world (for me) markdown is what I use
    in GitHub when I create a document. This is a markup format. But I don't think
    you’re talking about that. [Anna agrees] So what is “markdown”?
  sec: 2494
  time: '41:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's actually a great use case. You know how the whole world today is talking
    about sustainability and waste reduction? It goes in this direction. So what your
    model is doing – you know how many products are left with a certain BBD (best
    before date). For example, you have 100 of your goods left of this type, and they’re
    expiring in 3 days. What the system then tries to calculate is “What is the optimal
    discount we should give, so that we will be able to sell out all 100 of the goods
    without losing too much money?”
  sec: 2509
  time: '41:49'
  who: Anna
- line: In terms of what is happening, I can even explain the concept of a model.
    It’s more or less based on elasticity – price versus how much people are willing
    to buy it. You say “How much I predict to sell at a price of certain level, and
    you go through all the created prices, and you take the minimum discount, which
    brings you to a series that sells everything out.” And there's three targets underneath
    – you certainly want to reduce waste. In some countries, we even put the food
    as a donation, but we still pay money on top. So that's really a penalty that
    you have to pay. So we reduce the waste. Why just throw things away?
  sec: 2509
  time: '41:49'
  who: Anna
- line: The second thing is to increase our revenue. If we maybe start just three
    days in advance when doing the discount, and you manage to sell everything – you
    may have almost lost nothing. Last but not least, there’s also streamlining of
    the process. That is also very interesting, and I would love to share this with
    the community. Sometimes the automation that data science brings, also brings
    a clear process. The feedback that we got about markdown in the beginning was
    not about the numbers. It was about the automatic process. Now it's a system.
  sec: 2509
  time: '41:49'
  who: Anna
- line: There's an app that’s called “M Store” (METRO store) and the employee runs
    with it and says “Okay, now you have to discount this yogurt by 20%,” and then
    the employees are just doing it. Before it was a process where an employee had
    to follow some guidelines – the guidelines were somewhere, so every time you had
    a new employee, you had to onboard him or her. Also, depending on the store there
    was also fraud. Fraud in the sense that “Hey Alexey. You're my friend. You just
    come and I put 50% stickers on this yogurt and you take them.” That is also something
    that was taken out. It's just that there's now a clear process and clear guidelines
    – the person doesn't even have to think about it.

    did it look like?
  sec: 2688
  time: '44:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was the business that came with the proposal. In my eyes, it's great if
    you have a sole visionary and you have great ideas, but I truly believe that business
    operations are your customer who knows where the problems are or what the problems
    are that they want to solve. And that is where we should start. I always say,
    depending on whether it’s data analytics or data science – I go to the business
    and say “Tell us what your problem is. Tell us what you would love to have improved.”
    And that's where you have to start solving. But sometimes there also can be challenges.

  who: Anna
- header: How Anna handles all her responsibilities
- line: I lost my train of thought. I wanted to ask you, “What does it actually mean
    to be responsible for a domain?” You have six domains, I think, according to your
    LinkedIn. [Anna agrees] These domains, I think, you've talked about all of them
    (or most of them) – recommendation systems, churn, markdown, fulfillment, royalty
    pricing, and you also mentioned this new initiative, which is credit scoring.
    [Anna agrees] Then it's just one person who needs to oversee all of that, which
    is you. So what does it mean to be responsible for a domain? How do you even manage
    to look after so many things?
  sec: 2757
  time: '45:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: The data scientists or the data products are still part of the product team.
    For example, in the example of markdown, there are three teams responsible for
    the M Store application. The employees are using it to receive new goods, report
    some damages, and so on. And that's just normal, three product teams with developers
    who are developing frontend, backend and so on. While markdowns is just yet another
    service. So that means that at the moment, I have two people and some external
    support that are responsible for this piece. But they have a product manager who
    streamlines that and pushes it forward locally. So it's not that I have to oversee
    it on a daily basis.
  sec: 2808
  time: '46:48'
  who: Anna
- line: I still need to understand what’s happening there because it goes hand in
    hand with people management. So if my directs give some feedback or complain,
    or raise some proposals, they sometimes want me to get pulled in. Sometimes I’m
    also happy to challenge something based on my experience. For example, if they
    say, “We would love now to improve this and that,” I will be pulled in. Also if
    there is a proposal to try something completely new, again, it's me being there.
  sec: 2808
  time: '46:48'
  who: Anna
- line: I don't need to oversee the process of the dailies, retros, and so on – those
    happenings have dedicated product teams. It’s the same for recommenders – they
    have their own product owner. It’s the same for the churn and CRM – they have
    a product and Agile coach. They work, but I'm the one who can rerotate people,
    who oversees it in a rough detail, who is called if there needs to be a justification.

- line: Okay. Because you mentioned FTE, so you probably operate in these terms, like
    “Okay, for this project, we have two and a half FTE. For this project, just one
    and a half.” [Anna agrees] That's what you do, okay. When I was preparing questions,
    it was just six domains. Now, you also mentioned this new one. How does it happen
    that you get an entirely new domain? What's the process?
  sec: 2924
  time: '48:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: So you mean an entirely new use case? As I said, in many ways. Sometimes it's
    that the business will come and say “We have a great idea!” And that's really
    where I have to be active. First of all, I have to justify “Is the idea really
    big enough?” Because, I will be honest, I have seen situations where it was like
    “Oh! AI! We have some text issues in our data! Can we use AI to correct it?” And
    so I was like, “Okay. What are we talking about? Some broken entries? How many
    broken entries are we talking about? 200? You're not doing any text AI for 200
    entries. Hire yourself a student worker for two hours, and let him or her correct
    manually and you're done.” This is the kinds of conversations that I'm driving.
    That can be one that I push back to the business.
  sec: 2954
  time: '49:14'
  who: Anna
- line: Nevertheless, there are some great ideas. For example, with assortment there
    was a situation. The business side came and said, “We have great ideas. We need
    to reduce the assortment. That is part of our big journey of a METRO and we would
    love to optimize assortment (maybe not reduce, but optimize) to see what is driving
    our customer into the store.” In a data sense, it's a great task, and I was very,
    very inspired. So I said, “It's great. But then bring me some money for people.”
    Sometimes it also stops there. You say “bring the money for people,” and then
    I hire you the best talent, I ensure we have the right setup, but we need to hire
    new people. That doesn't sound like a “20% on top” kind of project. Then for example,
    if that happens, then you can start running it. As I said, in a nutshell, I always
    prefer if the idea comes from business.
  sec: 2954
  time: '49:14'
  who: Anna
- line: Interesting. I really love this – that you can just hire somebody to do this,
    because it's just 200 rows, right? Somebody can just go through this. I think
    this is what I, as a data scientist, have problems with. For me, machine learning
    is a hammer and I want to use it for every nail. But then sometimes manual work
    is – it's boring, but it gets the job done. That's interesting.
  sec: 3083
  time: '51:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sometimes, maybe. Let’s add something here. Sometimes I would agree to do
    some manual effort, but manual not in the sense that – correcting 200 lines, it
    will be 200 entries, it will never get a go. But sometimes people will come and
    say, “I would love for you to optimize the assortment. I'm not sure that if you're
    able to do it (like you as a data scientist, not me personally),” then I'm okay
    to say, “Do something more at the level of Jupyter Notebook and then the results
    are just here in CSV. Then let the corresponding category manager check the results.”
    It's completely not the way I want to have it. Normally I'm [audio cuts out] CSV,
    Excel, whatever. But to get a foot in the door, I would sometimes agree to do
    this kind of small proof of our abilities that will get this buy-in. Really, with
    clear communication, it is not the process. We just can share with you the results
    and use and check.

    created something like that – it’s just a list of questions that I always share
    when someone approaches me with an idea. Obviously I have some structure there.
    But as I said, from there on, it's more of an overtime development process. It’s

    product management. You can get a co organizer of ProductsTank in your city, so
    you officially belong to this cooperation or you’re franchising under their name.
    And that is a meetup you try to run regularly about product topics. We have, for
    example, one on Thursday the 27th of October. We try to bring like product folks,
    but also everyone else, talk about how to create great products. For example,
    next time we'll be talking about hypothesis-driven development via testing and
    automation.

- line: It is offline. The next one will be offline again. For two years we were trying
    to do it remotely. I guess, the first two remote ones were real successes. We
    even managed to get some product owners. There was one lady connecting from New
    York and giving a talk and we were so motivated, like “Oh, now you can have speakers
    from all over the world!” But I have to admit, after the two first sessions, I
    had the feeling everyone was tired. Now again, you're already in your meetings
    the whole day online for eight hours. And then you have to sit down and listen
    again to yet another speaker. So we were not doing much last year. But this year,
    it’s again a live event.

- line: So what we're doing now is contributing to this “After eight hours of meetings,
    now you sit down and listen to us.” But maybe it's not a bad thing in the end.
    If it's evening for you and the end of your working day, it’s not a bad way to
    finish your Friday.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that’s for sure. But I guess the difference is that here, the people
    here are willing to watch and educate themselves and see another opinion. A big
    part of the product community was the community – this new network and just being
    together, eating this food together. That is a piece that kind of got lost. That
    is also, I guess, what people are looking forward to.

- line: Did you ever ask yourself why it's called a tank? Why ProductTank? Why specifically
    “tank”? Did you wonder?

  who: Alexey
- line: No. [chuckles] But now you're asking. I have to check.

- header: Anna’s resource recommendations
- line: Okay. Yeah, please share what you find. I’m really curious why they thought
    this was a good idea. I mean, probably tank is not only like a war tank – it probably
    has multiple meanings. Anyways, there’s another thing. There was a suggestion
    from one of our listeners, Johanna, who suggested that we should ask every guest
    for some resource recommendations. And I was wondering if there is any book or
    other resource that you can recommend to our listeners.
  sec: 3468
  time: '57:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Considering we started with product management and data science, I really
    recommend one book that’s called Data Science for Business. If you're already
    a very dense data scientist, it's not the book you should read. But if you're
    more of an experienced product manager who would be willing to be a product manager
    or product owner of a data product, you should go for it. It's called Data Science
    for Business and it's by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett. If you Google “Data Science
    for Business,” it’s the first thing you get. And it also says “what you need to
    know about data mining and data analytic thinking”. It really gives you a very
    good overview of the topic and what it is about. It starts very basic. It explains
    what predictions are. And it's very entertaining – very easy to read.

  who: Anna
- line: I think this is not the first time I have heard about this book. But you said
    it won’t be very interesting for people who already know data science.
  sec: 3578
  time: '59:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s more like business people transitioning towards data science, not the
    other way around. I don't know. Maybe someone who is in data science and wants
    to understand how business thinks? It will also help you to see, “Okay, that is
    a perspective of how to explain to them. So that is maybe the way I should talk
    to business people.” That might be also helpful. What I like about it is that
    it’s easily written. You're not falling asleep after two pages.

- line: '[chuckles] Okay, that''s a good quality for a book, right? Not a textbook.
    Okay. That''s all we have time for. So thanks a lot, Anna, for coming, joining
    us, sharing your experience with us. Thanks, everyone. There is a very lively
    discussion in live chat. So thanks for joining and engaging in this discussion.
    That was fun. Thanks a lot.'
