- line: "Let\u2019s start with the second talk of today. We will talk about personal\
    \ branding and we have a special guest today, Admond. Admond is a data scientist,\
    \ writer and speaker. He is currently a data science instructor at Hakwagan Academy\
    \ with a mission to make data science accessible to everyone through education.\
    \ Welcome, Admond."
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi Alexey. Great to join and very excited to be part of the conference. I
    hope to add value by sharing some of the experiences and mistakes I have encountered
    along my journey. I look forward to this.
  sec: 6
  time: 0:06
  who: Admond
- line: "Thanks for coming. Before we move to our main topic about personal branding,\
    \ let\u2019s start with your background. Can you tell us a bit about your career\
    \ journey so far"
  sec: 24
  time: 0:24
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. It has been a roller coaster. I started about two and a half years ago
    as a physics student. During an overseas internship in Switzerland I attended
    my first machine learning workshop and immediately fell in love with it. When
    I returned to Singapore two months later I started learning data science concepts
    on my own.
  sec: 54
  time: 0:54
  who: Admond
- line: I learned through seminars, conferences, mentors and books. I found all of
    it fascinating. That was how I started my data science journey. Later I moved
    to my first full time role as a data scientist. I did not start as a full timer
    immediately because I wanted more experience to build my portfolio.
  sec: 77
  time: '1:17'
  who: Admond
- line: I worked as an intern for a few months and then moved into a full time role
    as a data scientist. Now I am a full time data science instructor at Hakwagan,
    hoping to share what I have learned with people who want to start their data science
    journey but do not know how to begin.
  sec: 103
  time: '1:43'
  who: Admond
- line: "Helping people start fits very well with today\u2019s topic. Let\u2019s begin\
    \ with a simple question. What is personal branding to you What does it mean"
  sec: 138
  time: '2:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is a broad idea. To me personal branding is more than getting followers.
    That is a vanity metric and should not be the goal. For me it is about sharing
    your expertise, experiences, knowledge and even your mistakes so you can help
    others.
  sec: 164
  time: '2:44'
  who: Admond
- line: As you keep sharing you build an online presence and people begin to know
    you. For example on LinkedIn recruiters or hiring managers may notice your profile.
    That is how personal branding helps others notice you while you help people learn.
  sec: 182
  time: '3:02'
  who: Admond
- line: Throughout my personal branding journey this has been the most fulfilling
    part of my career.
  sec: 221
  time: '3:41'
  who: Admond
- line: In your opinion this makes you more visible on social media. When someone
    is searching for a job they want to get noticed. They become active on social
    media and hiring managers start recognizing them. When they apply for a job employers
    might think they have seen this person before and prioritize them. Is that correct
  sec: 236
  time: '3:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. This is one of the most effective ways to differentiate yourself
    during a job search. If you just submit your resume like everyone else it is hard
    to stand out. A strong personal brand makes a big difference.
  sec: 278
  time: '4:38'
  who: Admond
- line: Is personal brand the same as online presence or is there something more
  sec: 295
  time: '4:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: It includes both online and offline presence. How you are perceived online
    often becomes how you are perceived offline. First impressions matter. When people
    meet you in person they already have an impression formed through your online
    presence.
  sec: 306
  time: '5:06'
  who: Admond
- line: "Personal branding requires consistency. You cannot share something once a\
    \ month and expect results. It requires a long term commitment. When your presence\
    \ stays on people\u2019s minds they think of you when opportunities arise and\
    \ they reach out. That leads to more chances to grow your career."
  sec: 324
  time: '5:24'
  who: Admond
- line: So you need to be known in a specific area. For example if someone thinks
    about people in Singapore who are good at teaching data science they immediately
    think of you. Is this a form of personal branding
  sec: 369
  time: '6:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would rephrase it. Instead of being famous it is about being known as someone
    established in your expertise.
  sec: 388
  time: '6:28'
  who: Admond
- line: How do we establish this expertise
  sec: 406
  time: '6:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Everyone has their own preference. Some like writing articles on Medium. Some
    prefer podcasts. Some prefer videos. I prefer writing and face to face sharing
    which is why I became an instructor. I also share many data science articles on
    Medium.
  sec: 412
  time: '6:52'
  who: Admond
- line: Writing helps me think deeper about what I know. It helps me reflect, understand
    better and share with others. So the choice of channel depends on what you enjoy.
  sec: 450
  time: '7:30'
  who: Admond
- line: So you started posting actively on Medium and that is how people noticed you
  sec: 476
  time: '7:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Back then I just wanted to share my data science journey. I did not
    know about personal branding. I submitted articles to Towards Data Science and
    they got published. I received comments from readers and realized I was onto something.
  sec: 483
  time: '8:03'
  who: Admond
- line: I committed to writing one article every week. Not every day but consistently
    every week for months. That is how I built momentum. You cannot write once in
    a blue moon and expect to establish yourself. Consistency is key.
  sec: 535
  time: '8:55'
  who: Admond
- line: You wrote consistently for a few months and people started responding. That
    helped you stay motivated
  sec: 576
  time: '9:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. That led to publications picking up my work and republishing it across
    platforms which helped me reach a wider audience.
  sec: 588
  time: '9:48'
  who: Admond
- line: When you publish regularly most posts go unnoticed. At some point they start
    getting traction. How did you convince yourself to keep going when almost nobody
    reacted
  sec: 619
  time: '10:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is true. When nothing gets traction you doubt yourself. What kept me
    going was passion. I love writing. Second I received messages mostly on LinkedIn
    from people who read my articles. They told me the articles helped them. Even
    helping one person was enough for me to continue during the early days.
  sec: 655
  time: '10:55'
  who: Admond
- line: You also mentioned Towards Data Science already had an audience which helped
    your work get noticed
  sec: 711
  time: '11:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Leveraging existing audiences is important. Publishing on your own
    makes it harder for editors or readers to find you. Joining a publication was
    the best decision for me.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Admond
- line: It is very hard to get noticed even by Medium editors or other publications.
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Admond
- line: For me getting into Towards Data Science was the best decision to start.
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Admond
- line: For me yes.
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Admond
- line: I personally know you from LinkedIn. This is where I saw you. I am not very
    active on Medium. I sometimes stumble across posts from LinkedIn or Twitter but
    I do not read Medium daily. How did this transition happen for you from being
    known on Medium to being known on social media?
  sec: 758
  time: '12:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Good question. I did this at the same time. When I was deciding which social
    media to focus on I knew I could not be everywhere because there is only one Leng.
    So I decided to focus on Medium and LinkedIn. I put all my time and effort into
    these two channels.
  sec: 788
  time: '13:08'
  who: Admond
- line: I started writing articles every week. That was one thing. The second thing
    was committing to post content on LinkedIn every one or two days. One week I would
    post three to four times by sharing my experience or a snippet of my articles
    or by sharing the articles I wrote on Medium.
  sec: 812
  time: '13:32'
  who: Admond
- line: It was a difficult process especially on LinkedIn. It is not like Medium and
    it is a completely different ecosystem. To get traction I needed to understand
    how each ecosystem works because every platform has its own audience with different
    preferences. Medium is long form writing but LinkedIn has a strict limit. I needed
    to write an engaging story within about thirteen hundred characters.
  sec: 843
  time: '14:03'
  who: Admond
- line: People need to follow the story and have a takeaway at the end. Creating content
    is one of the toughest things ever.
  sec: 883
  time: '14:43'
  who: Admond
- line: Yes it is very tough. You started writing on Medium and at the same time you
    started writing on LinkedIn right?
  sec: 893
  time: '14:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct.
  sec: 915
  time: '15:15'
  who: Admond
- line: I thought you wrote on Medium first and then posted articles on LinkedIn.
    LinkedIn does not like links. When I share a link it gets very few views and when
    I share a story it gets more engagement. I wanted to ask how you overcame that
    but now I understand that besides sharing links you also shared personal stories
    on LinkedIn.
  sec: 922
  time: '15:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Sometimes it was different types of content beyond articles. I shared
    personal journeys not related to data science and something inspiring. I also
    shared a bit of data science content. Sometimes it was something random or funny
    that I found.
  sec: 952
  time: '15:52'
  who: Admond
- line: When sharing content to help people it does not always need to be related
    to your field. It can be personal or career related. It can be inspiring or sad.
    Sometimes sharing a quote motivates others. You never know who is having a hard
    day and finds your content helpful and this impact is what I love.
  sec: 984
  time: '16:24'
  who: Admond
- line: I can relate to that. I am also curious because you said people do not usually
    do this for personal brand and you did not know that term. Did you just wake up
    one day and decide to share on LinkedIn and Medium? How did you decide to post
    once per week on Medium and three or four times per week on LinkedIn? What led
    you to this decision?
  sec: 1011
  time: '16:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Before I started sharing anything I followed many data science mentors long
    before two years ago. They shared a lot on LinkedIn. At that time I had just started
    being active on LinkedIn and I did not post anything. I only read what they posted
    and found it very helpful. I would say seventy to eighty percent of the data science
    knowledge I learned was not from books but from LinkedIn.
  sec: 1049
  time: '17:29'
  who: Admond
- line: That is when I realized LinkedIn is not just a job search platform. It is
    much more than that. People think they just upload a resume to find a job but
    that was not how I saw it. LinkedIn is great for networking, learning, and sharing.
    That made me want to move from being only a consumer to being a producer.
  sec: 1088
  time: '18:08'
  who: Admond
- line: I also realized the data science community on LinkedIn is very helpful. You
    can ask a simple question like what should I learn and it will trigger real discussion.
    People are passionate. That is why I love it and why I share.
  sec: 1126
  time: '18:46'
  who: Admond
- line: For me it started when I gave a talk and shared the slides on LinkedIn. The
    post blew up for me. Maybe fifty likes but that was huge for me. Then I understood
    there was something there. If I shared again after giving a talk people reacted
    and this pulled me in. Was it similar for you?
  sec: 1157
  time: '19:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Not every post goes viral. Once you see traction like your fifty likes
    you start thinking you should post more useful content. When you see comments
    and people saying they found it helpful it motivates you a lot.
  sec: 1193
  time: '19:53'
  who: Admond
- line: That is why I kept posting consistently. Even now I share content at least
    three to four times a week on LinkedIn. I am not so frequent on Medium because
    of work commitments but LinkedIn is still my favorite platform.
  sec: 1230
  time: '20:30'
  who: Admond
- line: Writing a full Medium post takes more time. On LinkedIn you can draft something
    quickly and see if the idea resonates and then convert it into an article.
  sec: 1255
  time: '20:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. Exactly. Did you do that?
  sec: 1275
  time: '21:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 1275
  time: '21:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: How I put up content is through Hootsuite. It is a platform to schedule content.
    I do not prefer writing a post every day because that is very time consuming.
    I spend one or two hours on a weekend. Within these hours I generate all the ideas
    I have and make them bite size content to share on LinkedIn or Twitter.
  sec: 1282
  time: '21:22'
  who: Admond
- line: I schedule everything right away throughout the next week. So this week I
    generate some content and schedule it for next week. This is my workflow. It saves
    me time and makes me more productive.
  sec: 1314
  time: '21:54'
  who: Admond
- line: If you imagine coming home after work every day and writing content you will
    spend half an hour daily and more weekly. Productivity is important for me.
  sec: 1325
  time: '22:05'
  who: Admond
- line: I am curious about this. You said once a week you sit down for one or two
    hours and generate as many ideas as possible. How does the idea generation process
    look to you? Where do you get inspiration?
  sec: 1344
  time: '22:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Good question. Content generation is not easy. I always have some resources.
    For example Feedly. Feedly is a data aggregator platform and it is free.
  sec: 1356
  time: '22:36'
  who: Admond
- line: It aggregates all the platforms you select every day. If you wonder what content
    to post you can refer to it and see which articles catch your interest. You read
    the article and if it is helpful you can generate your content right away. You
    write your thoughts about the article and what you think about it.
  sec: 1382
  time: '23:02'
  who: Admond
- line: Another way is through BuzzSumo. BuzzSumo features the top content on the
    internet for many topics. If you wonder what topics get attention right now you
    can read what is trending. You can also check trending topics on Twitter.
  sec: 1399
  time: '23:19'
  who: Admond
- line: From there you can get ideas for your content. For example if I see how to
    go into data science trending that means people are very interested in entering
    data science. I might write a post with seven steps to raise their chances and
    this increases interest.
  sec: 1437
  time: '23:57'
  who: Admond
- line: There are different ways to find ideas. Another preference is writing down
    ideas whenever I have them. When I work and I have an idea I cannot memorize everything.
    So I use Evernote.
  sec: 1462
  time: '24:22'
  who: Admond
- line: I jot down my thoughts there. I write only the topic because I will write
    the full thing on Sunday. I compile them and write on Sunday.
  sec: 1487
  time: '24:47'
  who: Admond
- line: Another source of inspiration is looking at other people's content. In the
    data science community some posts get more engagement than others. I look at what
    moved people. I check the format such as video, written content or audio.
  sec: 1506
  time: '25:06'
  who: Admond
- line: Sometimes it is a PDF. I tested one time and posted a PDF cheat sheet on LinkedIn.
    That went crazy. It is all about experimentation and sharing.
  sec: 1537
  time: '25:37'
  who: Admond
- line: Once you notice the pattern you focus on it. But LinkedIn's algorithm always
    changes. The most important thing is the quality of your content. Make sure your
    content adds value instead of copying others.
  sec: 1550
  time: '25:50'
  who: Admond
- line: We have Ravit in the comments. He uses the PDF format a lot. He shares cheat
    sheets and gets a lot of engagement. What do you think about other platforms?
    LinkedIn is not the only one. There are others like Reddit, Quora, Twitter. What
    do you think about them?
  sec: 1574
  time: '26:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are many platforms. I would love to try Clubhouse some day. When I get
    an iPhone because I am using Android. Clubhouse is my future platform to try.
  sec: 1610
  time: '26:50'
  who: Admond
- line: The current platform I am trying is Twitter. Recently I am moving more toward
    Twitter because I see opportunities to share content there. But Twitter is a very
    different ecosystem compared to LinkedIn.
  sec: 1632
  time: '27:12'
  who: Admond
- line: It is crowded and noisy. You cannot write long form stories like on LinkedIn.
    When I want to share something I need to restrict my word count or create multiple
    threads.
  sec: 1650
  time: '27:30'
  who: Admond
- line: Another channel I would like to try is Quora. It is a Q and A platform. Also
    Stack Overflow for technical answers. I would suggest these as well.
  sec: 1669
  time: '27:49'
  who: Admond
- line: These question answering platforms are interesting. You said you started because
    you wanted to share knowledge. These platforms are great for sharing knowledge
    and answering questions.
  sec: 1689
  time: '28:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Quora, Reddit and Stack Exchange platforms are good for that.
  sec: 1701
  time: '28:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. People can upvote your answers. If the answers are helpful and add
    value people upvote and you gain visibility. You then build your portfolio on
    Quora or Stack Overflow.
  sec: 1708
  time: '28:28'
  who: Admond
- line: One trick I used when I was active on Quora is that it gives inspiration.
    When you get a question you see what people are curious about. You answer it and
    then put the answer on LinkedIn or Twitter. It resonates with people.
  sec: 1725
  time: '28:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is a nice trick for anyone listening to try. Be helpful on Quora and then
    repurpose the content on other platforms.
  sec: 1757
  time: '29:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Great. I will try it out soon.
  sec: 1764
  time: '29:24'
  who: Admond
- line: You mentioned Clubhouse which is an iPhone only thing. I have not tried it
    because I also have Android. It is not inclusive. It is audio only. Podcasts are
    also audio only. Sometimes podcasts include video like this one because it is
    on YouTube. We will release it as audio too. What is your opinion on podcasts?
  sec: 1771
  time: '29:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have been wanting to start a podcast since last year but I did not have
    time to commit. It requires more time than writing content. From what I have heard
    and seen I think podcasts are a great way to share content.
  sec: 1803
  time: '30:03'
  who: Admond
- line: You can have fifteen minutes, half an hour or one hour with one guest or a
    few guests discussing a topic. You share opinions and perspectives. It helps the
    audience learn from the conversation.
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Admond
- line: Instead of only writing articles people hear different opinions. They may
    form their own perspective. That is helpful for others.
  sec: 1836
  time: '30:36'
  who: Admond
- line: So basically when it is a discussion rather than one person talking or writing
    it can be more entertaining and more exploratory. You can explore a topic by exchanging
    opinion and talking about it.
  sec: 1855
  time: '30:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly and it is a good way to network with others.
  sec: 1866
  time: '31:06'
  who: Admond
- line: So is it a good thing for establishing a personal brand like being on a podcast
    as a guest or as a host?
  sec: 1879
  time: '31:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: What I would say is it is definitely a huge opportunity. You can see on LinkedIn
    many people are pushing written content. Let us focus on the data science domain.
    You see a lot of written content and step by step posts. It is unlikely you see
    someone sharing podcasts about data science unless they are celebrities.
  sec: 1886
  time: '31:26'
  who: Admond
- line: Usually people share articles or YouTube videos. So I think podcast is another
    domain to build a personal brand and if audio is your strength by all means go
    for it. I think there is a huge opportunity to build your personal brand there.
    I like places where not many people are and you go in and build your expertise
    and your personal brand. That is how you get an early game opportunity.
  sec: 1916
  time: '31:56'
  who: Admond
- line: But it is also a bit challenging because when you have video or write you
    can use diagrams and visuals. In data science we have formulas and code and it
    is challenging to do that in audio only without slides or text. You have to be
    good at explaining things.
  sec: 1953
  time: '32:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: That trains your communication skills. One of the good things about podcasts
    or videos is you can redistribute your content in different formats. When you
    have a podcast recorded you can turn it into a written format and share it on
    Medium. You can also share podcast snippets of maybe one minute on Instagram,
    LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.
  sec: 1972
  time: '32:52'
  who: Admond
- line: If you have one hour of podcast you can split it into ten different content.
    I learned this from Gary Vaynerchuk.
  sec: 2015
  time: '33:35'
  who: Admond
- line: I know he is famous. I have not followed him but many people mentioned him
    as their inspiration to be active on social media. What do you think about offline
    stuff? We talked mostly about online platforms like LinkedIn and Medium and podcasts
    which are more online.
  sec: 2029
  time: '33:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: What about the offline world? How can we become more visible outside the internet?
    Right now it is difficult with lockdown but in Singapore maybe restrictions are
    less strong.
  sec: 2062
  time: '34:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: How can we be more visible outside LinkedIn and Medium? Now because of Covid
    we cannot go out to meet new people daily but let us assume Covid is not here.
  sec: 2082
  time: '34:42'
  who: Admond
- line: One platform I use is LinkedIn. I bring my online connection to offline through
    LinkedIn. We know each other on LinkedIn and comment on posts but have not met.
    When I meet someone I say I would love to have a catchup and ask if they have
    time in Singapore at a cafe.
  sec: 2098
  time: '34:58'
  who: Admond
- line: Another way is through meetups. I attended many meetups in Singapore. Google
    organizes monthly meetups and from there I knew many people. We got to know each
    other better and I learned about the industry.
  sec: 2128
  time: '35:28'
  who: Admond
- line: Another platform I use which is not very popular yet in Singapore is Lunch
    Club.
  sec: 2154
  time: '35:54'
  who: Admond
- line: Have you heard of that?
  sec: 2160
  time: '36:00'
  who: Admond
- line: Yes I did.
  sec: 2165
  time: '36:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: I recently joined Lunch Club and it is fantastic. I did not meet people in
    person but we meet online on Zoom or Google Meet. I met people from different
    industries like lawyers, designers, entrepreneurs and students. I learned a lot
    not only in data science and it broadened my perspective.
  sec: 2173
  time: '36:13'
  who: Admond
- line: Who knows maybe in the future you may have business opportunities together.
    Lunch Club is underrated but it requires invitation like Clubhouse.
  sec: 2203
  time: '36:43'
  who: Admond
- line: These are the ways I bring online to offline. Not all connections but maybe
    someone you have known for some time and want to catch up.
  sec: 2221
  time: '37:01'
  who: Admond
- line: It makes sense. Connections on LinkedIn are shallow. We comment on posts but
    when you meet a person the weak connection becomes strong. It is better for networking
    and job opportunities.
  sec: 2229
  time: '37:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I recommend that in the beginning when someone starts to build a personal
    brand if someone invites you for offline catchup do not say no. Always say yes.
    You will not know what comes next. Many times people say they do not have time
    or do not know the person and do not feel like going out.
  sec: 2260
  time: '37:40'
  who: Admond
- line: Just say yes and try. Cool opportunities come when you meet someone new. My
    experience is that all amazing opportunities came from people I knew offline that
    I brought from online.
  sec: 2288
  time: '38:08'
  who: Admond
- line: I am curious about people who are not extroverted and prefer not to meet people.
    They like to sit in front of a computer and talk maybe only with close friends.
    When someone invites them to a cafe they think what does this person want and
    is it safe.
  sec: 2313
  time: '38:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I imagined awkward situations where we sit and drink coffee without talking
    and after ten minutes I say I need to go. When I eventually agreed to meet someone
    that awkward situation did not happen. What happened was amazing. I met new people
    and got good connections.
  sec: 2330
  time: '38:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: How to overcome this barrier and say yes?
  sec: 2385
  time: '39:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I feel you because there are awkward moments. You cannot talk nonstop for
    one or two hours. There is always silence and people by nature hate silence when
    with others.
  sec: 2390
  time: '39:50'
  who: Admond
- line: I would say maybe two things here based on my experience. Being vulnerable
    as you are is important. If I meet someone I do not mind sharing some of my weaknesses
    and saying I do not know something. By admitting that you do not know people are
    more open to share what they know to help you. People are willing to help and
    you just need to give them a chance.
  sec: 2408
  time: '40:08'
  who: Admond
- line: You give that chance by being vulnerable and that is how we connect by opening
    our door first. The second thing is to think about common topics we can relate
    to. If I am meeting someone at a cafe I may talk about recent news like Covid
    or Clubhouse and ask if they use it.
  sec: 2442
  time: '40:42'
  who: Admond
- line: Then they share their Clubhouse experience and now there is a new topic. It
    is something the person is interested in and you are curious to know so there
    is an exchange of information. I find that very interesting.
  sec: 2473
  time: '41:13'
  who: Admond
- line: It is not just about one on one meetings in the offline world. We can also
    go to meetups not only as visitors but as speakers. If we talk about personal
    brand this is a more scalable way of establishing offline presence.
  sec: 2491
  time: '41:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: How can one get invited to a meetup to speak or how can one try to speak at
    a meetup?
  sec: 2511
  time: '41:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Good question. I remember the first time I got invited to a meetup. It was
    in a bank and I would not imagine I would go in and talk. What scared me was that
    most people were from a big company and I was speaking side by side with a CTO.
  sec: 2525
  time: '42:05'
  who: Admond
- line: I was the second speaker so I listened to the first speaker and thought I
    am not going to share what I prepared because these people will listen to me.
    I was fortunate to join but the reason I got invited was because I knew the person
    through LinkedIn.
  sec: 2548
  time: '42:28'
  who: Admond
- line: I brought this connection offline after meeting a few times and collaborating.
    People know you better and will start noticing you and inviting you when they
    need a speaker. That is the passive way where you wait for someone to approach
    you.
  sec: 2574
  time: '42:54'
  who: Admond
- line: A more active way is to look for conferences. Currently due to Covid there
    are many virtual conferences. You can search for data science conferences like
    DataTalks Club or Data Catered by KDD. They all need speakers and you can ask
    if they have vacancies.
  sec: 2591
  time: '43:11'
  who: Admond
- line: You can say you have this expertise and you would love to share something
    to add value to their audience and they might give you a chance if you just ask.
  sec: 2627
  time: '43:47'
  who: Admond
- line: But speaking of dedicated conferences I approached Kate and asked if I could
    speak at her conference and the answer was no because it was booked. When you
    ask people if you can speak there is a process where you submit a proposal and
    they review it and often you get rejected.
  sec: 2648
  time: '44:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: How do you deal with rejection when you want to teach something but they say
    no or it is already full?
  sec: 2672
  time: '44:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: That is understandable. Getting rejected is sad but I try to get feedback.
    I ask what their concern is, if it is full or if there is some mismatch with expectations
    or maybe it does not fit the conference theme. You cannot fit into every conference.
  sec: 2679
  time: '44:39'
  who: Admond
- line: I try to get feedback and reapply next round. With that feedback I refine
    my pitch and send it to another conference organizer to increase the chance of
    being featured or noticed. If you know someone who knows the organizer ask that
    person to recommend you.
  sec: 2722
  time: '45:22'
  who: Admond
- line: You then have a higher chance of being shortlisted. That is how I would suggest
    doing it.
  sec: 2753
  time: '45:53'
  who: Admond
- line: So basically have a good network. It is not just about your personal brand
    but also who you know.
  sec: 2760
  time: '46:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: The interesting situation is that we talk because I invited you but at some
    point you were reaching out to conference organizers. How did it happen that instead
    of you applying to conferences organizers started reaching out to you?
  sec: 2767
  time: '46:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did it happen to me? This is a very good question. Throughout the two
    year journey of attending online and offline meetups and conferences one reason
    is that I shared my speaking experiences on LinkedIn.
  sec: 2791
  time: '46:31'
  who: Admond
- line: People notice that you speak in public platforms and they notice you as a
    speaker in the data science space. When they have availability they approach you.
    The other thing is changing your headline which changed a lot for me.
  sec: 2815
  time: '46:55'
  who: Admond
- line: I read an article saying if you want something you have to let people know
    you are in that space. The LinkedIn headline is the first thing people see even
    when reading comments. I changed mine from data scientist to data scientist vertical
    bar speaker.
  sec: 2839
  time: '47:19'
  who: Admond
- line: You can still see it now. It gets you noticed not only through comments but
    also when people search for data science speaker. These three keywords increase
    the chance of your profile appearing at the top. LinkedIn is like SEO and your
    headline is like your SEO title.
  sec: 2872
  time: '47:52'
  who: Admond
- line: Interesting trick. For you personally when I looked for speakers for this
    conference I thought about the career session and I needed someone who can speak
    about personal brand. Your name immediately came to mind.
  sec: 2896
  time: '48:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is the power of personal brand. Who talks about personal brand in the
    data science space? For me your name popped up and this is a good example of a
    strong personal brand.
  sec: 2933
  time: '48:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: I am grateful for that. Personal brand is underrated not just in data science
    but in general. People tend not to share their experience. In many Asian countries
    people are reserved and conservative and do not like to share.
  sec: 2946
  time: '49:06'
  who: Admond
- line: I always recommend that people share and let others know. People are scared
    to be judged and we all fear that. You need to accept it and embrace it and share
    with the mindset that you want to help.
  sec: 2973
  time: '49:33'
  who: Admond
- line: Then you are free from that.
  sec: 2992
  time: '49:52'
  who: Admond
- line: This is a good topic because we have a question in Slido. How do you get the
    confidence to write when you learn data science yourself?
  sec: 2999
  time: '49:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: You talked about pressing the post button and thinking that everyone will
    see it and think you have no idea what you are talking about. You might be mistaken
    and you know you are not an expert. How do you convince yourself to have enough
    confidence to press the post?
  sec: 3007
  time: '50:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I definitely feel that. If you read software articles and the comments there
    I get many disagreements and I make many mistakes. These are not only grammar
    mistakes but also technical mistakes. I admit that because I am not experienced
    enough and I share for the sake of sharing my experience and helping others.
  sec: 3048
  time: '50:48'
  who: Admond
- line: To get the confidence to press the publish button do not write to impress
    or show how good you are. If you write only to impress that is not a good reason
    to write. Write because you want to help others who have gone through the same
    struggle.
  sec: 3054
  time: '50:54'
  who: Admond
- line: When you write with the mindset of helping it does not matter if people criticize
    you because you do it out of goodwill. You are not doing it to impress so that
    gives me confidence to write even when I get many comments. We all learn from
    the process.
  sec: 3078
  time: '51:18'
  who: Admond
- line: Maybe on LinkedIn it does not happen as much. When I share the community is
    friendlier.
  sec: 3070
  time: '51:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: On Twitter it is sometimes like the wild west. You can be anonymous and people
    write many nasty things.
  sec: 3076
  time: '51:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: They say you do not know anything and ask who allowed you to write. That is
    demotivating. Next time you want to write you wonder if you should press the button
    because of those comments.
  sec: 3083
  time: '51:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: How do you develop thick skin so these comments do not get to you.
  sec: 3111
  time: '51:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Different approaches work for different people. To deal with negative comments
    try to engage them and understand where they come from. I receive this from time
    to time and I reply with thanks and appreciation and see where I can improve.
  sec: 3182
  time: '53:02'
  who: Admond
- line: Instead of going against them understand that everyone has an opinion and
    nobody is always right. Be open minded so you will not feel the need to fight
    back.
  sec: 3200
  time: '53:20'
  who: Admond
- line: When you appreciate their comment it makes them feel acknowledged and less
    offended. They would not think you are hiding something.
  sec: 3240
  time: '54:00'
  who: Admond
- line: The energy may be negative and someone may want to start a flame war but you
    are turning that negative energy into something positive.
  sec: 3261
  time: '54:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: We have a related comment about imposter syndrome and this is what stops us
    from clicking publish.
  sec: 3278
  time: '54:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: I imagine you also deal with that. How do you overcome it especially on social
    media or public speaking.
  sec: 3290
  time: '54:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: I face this from time to time. I always admit that I am not a technical person.
    I tell people that if you ask me general machine learning questions I can answer
    but if you ask something very technical I will say I do not know because I am
    not an expert.
  sec: 3302
  time: '55:02'
  who: Admond
- line: To overcome imposter syndrome I try to understand myself better. I recognize
    what I am good at and what I am not good at.
  sec: 3322
  time: '55:22'
  who: Admond
- line: One of the quotes I like from Jack Ma is when people say you are not good
    think about whether you really are not good. When people say you are good think
    twice about whether you are really that good.
  sec: 3347
  time: '55:47'
  who: Admond
- line: This keeps me balanced so I do not get overly confident or too depressed when
    people say I am not good.
  sec: 3367
  time: '56:07'
  who: Admond
- line: Be self aware of your strengths and weaknesses by analyzing your journey and
    what you have learned.
  sec: 3378
  time: '56:18'
  who: Admond
- line: I want to talk about your teaching experience because it is connected to personal
    brand. Sharing knowledge and teaching is a good way to establish a personal brand.
  sec: 3392
  time: '56:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Is building online courses a good way to do that.
  sec: 3424
  time: '57:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Teaching definitely helps and building your own online course can scale well.
    If you can teach and share your expertise it builds your personal brand and can
    also bring revenue.
  sec: 3436
  time: '57:16'
  who: Admond
- line: There are free data science bootcamps organized by others that teach for the
    sake of helping. That is one of the best ways to build your personal brand.
  sec: 3457
  time: '57:37'
  who: Admond
- line: If you work on this full time you also need income so you need to balance
    building a personal brand and earning money.
  sec: 3483
  time: '58:03'
  who: Admond
- line: If I want to build a course and sell it I need to already have a personal
    brand so people trust me. If nobody knows me nobody will buy.
  sec: 3508
  time: '58:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: One way to build this trust is giving content for free like the bootcamp you
    mentioned. They became known and people trust them.
  sec: 3537
  time: '58:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: That depends on how you frame your brand. Everyone has their own brand and
    you cannot copy others. To build your brand you need to know what you stand for
    and what your values are.
  sec: 3615
  time: '1:00:15'
  who: Admond
- line: Once you know your values you can build your brand well. If you build it without
    knowing your values you may get confused later.
  sec: 3639
  time: '1:00:39'
  who: Admond

    For me I value serving others and sharing.
  sec: 3671

    improve.
  sec: 3686

    you are doing it.
  sec: 3704
  time: '1:01:44'

    term.

  sec: 3731

    show how to build your personal brand and how to polish your portfolio.
  sec: 3737

    content and scale it. I share resources and my content strategy.

  sec: 3808

    Overflow to get ideas.
  sec: 3815

    to write in a way that engages people.
  sec: 3847
  time: '1:04:07'
  who: Admond

    based on your audience. My best time on LinkedIn is 6 pm Singapore time.
  sec: 3872

  sec: 3916
  time: '1:05:16'

    I tested mid afternoon and people were working.
  sec: 3923
  time: '1:05:23'

  who: Admond
- line: A question for you. Are there disadvantages to having a strong personal brand.
  sec: 3993
  time: '1:06:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sometimes I get too carried away by social engagement. I commit to engaging
    with others by liking commenting and sharing. This takes time and I lose focus
    on priorities.
  sec: 4015
  time: '1:06:55'
  who: Admond
- line: It is time consuming and content generation takes time. Managing priorities
    is the main disadvantage.
  sec: 4048
  time: '1:07:28'
  who: Admond

    content and how do you manage time to build a personal brand while doing data
    science.
  sec: 4100

    writing my posts and scheduling them.
  sec: 4126
