transcript:
- line: "This week, we'll talk about building a data team for making decisions with\
    \ data. We have a special guest today, Tammy. Tammy is the chief of data at Platanomelon.\
    \ Platanomelon is a digital sex toy brand that empowers people to break taboos\
    \ on sexuality. Together with her passionate and creative team, they infuse data\
    \ analytics into the company\u2019s day-to-day operations and decision-making.\
    \ Tammy is also a co-host of a podcast called \u2018Data for Future\u2019. I was\
    \ recently interviewed on the podcast. We talked about many different things,\
    \ including DataTalks.Club, so check it out. It's a really cool podcast. Tammy\
    \ interviews people who are in the field of data or sustainability."

- line: "The topic for today is \u2018building data teams\u2019. Before we go into\
    \ our main topic, let's start with your background. Can you tell us a few words\
    \ about yourself?"
  sec: 130
  time: '2:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: A few words?
  sec: 142
  time: '2:22'
  who: Tammy
- line: About your career so far, yes. I also wanted to welcome you to the podcast,
    I think I haven't yet. So welcome, Tammy.

  who: Alexey
- line: "It's very nice to see you again and working together with you for another\
    \ podcast. A brief introduction about my background \u2013 How did I get into\
    \ data? I was studying in the US with an undergrad degree for business. Then carrying\
    \ that, I worked one year in Silicon Valley, in the bay area where I really got\
    \ to know a lot of people who work for big tech companies. They talk about data\
    \ technology, AI \u2013 and I saw the sparkle in their eyes, how passionate they\
    \ are about their job. That really got me intrigued. After reading some books\
    \ and doing some research, that landed me to stay in Barcelona to do my Master's\
    \ in Big Data. From there, my data career started. I first worked with a Spanish\
    \ unicorn called Glovo. It's a delivery company, almost like Uber Eats. With the\
    \ company growing, I was dedicated to analytics and supporting different departments.\
    \ From there on, I joined forces with Platanomelon, starting from zero. I started\
    \ by being the only one in the data team. Gradually, I proved the power of data\
    \ analytics and showed the amount of insights we can contribute to the business\
    \ and to the team. Then, little by little, we now have a growing team of five\
    \ people."

  who: Tammy
- header: Being the chief of data
- line: You started as the first data person that's really cool. What do you do as
    chief of data?
  sec: 247
  time: '4:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Well, that covers a lot. As I mentioned, I really grew my position from the\
    \ ground up. At the beginning, I was doing a lot of hands-on work myself. These\
    \ days, I'm doing less and less, but our functionality really covers a lot of\
    \ aspects of the business. One of our biggest parts is marketing. The nature of\
    \ our team is communication marketing with e-commerce. So, communication marketing\
    \ \u2013 whenever you do campaign communication, you always want to measure your\
    \ performance, because what can be measured can be improved. Then among all the\
    \ marketing channels that we are using, it's also important to compare them against\
    \ each other to see which channel brings the most efficiency, the first CAC, the\
    \ most/least CAC \u2013 this kind of marketing attribution model is something\
    \ we're working on."
  sec: 256
  time: '4:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: "But I have to say, due to the nature of our company, when we do publish,\
    \ for example, on Instagram, Facebook, and other social media, if a link reveals\
    \ a sex toy with one click, then we cannot really do an analysis of the advertisement.\
    \ With that being said, a lot of our job of doing analytics is quite tricky. We\
    \ have to get very creative about how to identify different data sources and try\
    \ to merge and mash them in different ways to serve our purpose and to make the\
    \ best educated guesses. On the other side, we also care a lot about the business\
    \ operation. Since you have e-commerce store going on and the prediction of orders\
    \ coming in for each product every day, it's very important to have an estimate\
    \ and then comparing it with our inventory in the warehouse. With this data combination,\
    \ we also give business insights like, \u201COkay, we are going to be out of stock\
    \ in one month. We need to start purchasing.\u201D We also help this operational\
    \ side. Then on the business side, day-to-day performance monitoring, we are very\
    \ web/e-commerce driven \u2013 the performance of the traffic and different product\
    \ performance conversion, our Shopify portfolio \u2013 we touch upon all these\
    \ aspects as well. The last aspect that we are going to focus on-"
  who: Alexey
- line: That's not all? You have even more?
  sec: 402
  time: '6:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. There's a lot. Just one more product than I\u2019m really excited about\
    \ is \u2013 we are very customer-centric, and we want to understand and listen\
    \ to our customers better and better. Therefore, we try to do a lot of social\
    \ listening and customer surveys. This kind of \u2018non-Big Data-ish\u2019 data\
    \ analytics, we are also doing that."
  sec: 404
  time: '6:44'
  who: Tammy
- header: First projects as the first data person in a company
- line: Yeah, that's a lot. Marketing, then demand forecasting, and then social listening.
    Those are the three main approaches. What was your first project that you started
    with as the only data person? Was it marketing or something else?
  sec: 427
  time: '7:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It was more about business health monitoring and about building dashboards.\
    \ If you think about helping an organization to start doing data analytics, the\
    \ most low-hanging fruit is actually to deliver timely monitoring about the business\u2019\
    s health. What I mean is \u2013 we have various data sources that are very important\
    \ to us, such as our web traffic: \u201CHow much traffic is coming in every day?\
    \ Does it get better or worse one day or the other because of our marketing campaigns?\
    \ Does our web traffic conversion change from day to day, because we change our\
    \ web design, introduced new product?\u201D So on and so forth."
  sec: 442
  time: '7:22'
  who: Tammy
- line: I started collaborating with the CEO and the different departments. Instead
    of once a week or once every month where everyone struggled to find the information
    and put together a PowerPoint presentation and spent a lot of time on it, I showed
    them that by connecting the sources and merging them well, we can discover a lot
    of rich information. At the same time, we can check it minute-by-minute, on the
    go.
  who: Tammy
- line: That's cool. So people in the company realized that it's very difficult to
    find the information they needed, especially when they want to prepare reports,
    like PowerPoint presentations. This is how they came to realize that they needed
    to hire a data person who would help them connect all the different data sources
    in such a way that it was just one click away. Is that right?
  sec: 508
  time: '8:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I would say that it's a little bit the other way around. It\u2019s more about\
    \ the management realizing, \u201COkay, we do have the need. Everyone is talking\
    \ about data and for the company to grow further it\u2019s maybe something we\
    \ need.\u201D But people in the departments that are producing reports day-to-day,\
    \ they didn't realize that data can help them. I remember at the beginning, I\
    \ needed to approach each department lead or people in the job functionality and\
    \ I said, \u201CHey, how about you introduce me to your day-to-day workflow, especially\
    \ when you're doing reporting and performance measurement. What do you do?\u201D\
    \ Then I proposed to them, \u201CWhy don't you work with me and we can help you\
    \ to produce automatic reporting. This will get more information and more in-depth\
    \ analysis about what\u2019s going on and how the performance is doing.\u201D\
    \ So I actually needed to convince them a little bit in the beginning. Whenever\
    \ you want to set up a dashboard and connect the data sources, you need collaboration\
    \ from the team in order to get the data and help them change their workflow and\
    \ habits. This can be challenging sometimes, but people tend to be very collaborative\
    \ once they discover that this actually brings a lot of value to them."
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Tammy
- header: Initial resistance
- line: "I\u2019m wondering \u2013 did you get any resistance initially?"
  sec: 606
  time: '10:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. There are some projects that are for the bigger picture of the company\
    \ \u2013 those that don't come to the pain point of each individual. You say \u201C\
    Hey, actually, we need each team to authorize or be careful about this data.\u201D\
    \ You require extra labor for everyone, but they may not necessarily see the benefit\
    \ directly shedding light on them. So this kind of effort is a little bit difficult."
  sec: 610
  time: '10:10'
  who: Tammy
- line: It's about making sure that the quality of data is good, right?
  sec: 636
  time: '10:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 643
  time: '10:43'
  who: Tammy
- line: "Because then these people \u2013 these teams \u2013 are producing some data,\
    \ right?"
  sec: 645
  time: '10:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sometimes the world is not ideal. You cannot stream all the data and
    automate everything, unfortunately. We are trying to reduce the amount of spreadsheets
    we use as much as possible. But in many cases, it's proven that that's the best
    way to collaborate with such a business-driven company.
  sec: 647
  time: '10:47'
  who: Tammy
- line: "So the management realized that the way people are creating reports is not\
    \ the most optimal way. They heard that data analytics can help \u2013 data in\
    \ general. This is how they realized that they need to hire somebody. They hired\
    \ you and you started by talking with every department, understanding what they\
    \ are doing there, what kind of data they need, or what kind of data they create."
  sec: 669
  time: '11:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Then you convinced them \u2013 you showed how useful that was. The first\
    \ thing was business monitoring, right? How well the company is doing, what happens\
    \ after a change, whether it leads to drops in traffic or increases in traffic\
    \ and things like that. So what happened after that?"
  who: Alexey
- header: Expanding the team
- line: You said, now there is a team of five people. How did you arrive at a point
    when you needed to hire the first person?
  sec: 720
  time: '12:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, it's been a journey. As I introduced in the beginning, the low-hanging\
    \ fruit is the dashboard. Then you realize that the team understands \u201COh!\
    \ You can actually solve many things for us!\u201D Then they come up with more\
    \ and more questions and requests. Certain questions and requests definitely go\
    \ out of the dimensions that the dashboard can cover. Therefore, we needed to\
    \ create web apps or models in order to be able to help the business make decisions\
    \ and solve their doubts."
  sec: 730
  time: '12:10'
  who: Tammy
- line: "One of the things is demand forecasting, which is something that is predictive.\
    \ Then we need to start building models in-house. Building a model means you need\
    \ to have historical data. Having historical data means you need to have a data\
    \ warehouse, where you can store the information and stream it. Then you realize,\
    \ \u201COkay, only having your historical sales doesn't help you with forecasting.\
    \ To forecast, there are many factors to consider.\u201D It may depend on the\
    \ product or the promotion event of the company, and things like that."
  who: Tammy
- line: "It is a company that is active every day \u2013 we have a lot of events going\
    \ on. So you need to ask each department to give you data before they take action,\
    \ like \u201CTell me what you're gonna do in the next week or a month.\u201D I\
    \ don't know about many other businesses, but I tend to see that people\u2019\
    s decision-making changes from day to day. Therefore, it's very difficult to convince\
    \ the team to give you a forecast of one week ahead when they're not sure what\
    \ is going to happen. But without that provision, we cannot forecast. This kind\
    \ of balance is one of the efforts we're making."
  who: Tammy
- line: "Going from there, there are some bigger projects that are about model development.\
    \ \u201COnce we have this model, how do we deliver it?\u201D It\u2019s a project\
    \ that in the end, we want to benefit the business, right? So how can the business\
    \ really use it and take advantage of it? We cannot give them a Jupyter Notebook\
    \ or Py file for them to use \u2013 they don't understand it. So how can we build\
    \ a web app, so that the user can enter and fine tune one or two filters or parameters\
    \ and get the result that they want? That also includes web deployment and a lot\
    \ of more things coming up."
  who: Tammy
- line: Were you trying to do this all by yourself at the beginning?
  sec: 883
  time: '14:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "At the beginning, I was enjoying machine learning and model building, because\
    \ I also enjoy coding very much. But then at the moment of delivery, I was like\
    \ \u201CI really have no idea. I totally skipped my data engineering class in\
    \ school.\u201D"
  sec: 886
  time: '14:46'
  who: Tammy
- line: You had a data engineering class.
  sec: 902
  time: '15:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I didn't think it was important at all. Now comes the time that I regret\
    \ that and I started seeking help. At the beginning, when I had my first hire,\
    \ we had a lot of demand for the dashboard \u2013 this was still one of the main\
    \ tasks that we are dedicated to. So my first hire is actually a data analyst,\
    \ not an engineer. Then, I was seeking help from my previous professor or I looked\
    \ for some existing solutions in the market that were kind of \u2018plug and play,\u2019\
    \ and then you can get your information. I tried, but in the end, the model just\
    \ varies a lot and the data source and the data output were very different. It\
    \ started to go beyond my capacity. Asking for help meant I needed to wait because\
    \ the people I asked were not part of our team. It\u2019s very fortunate that\
    \ the management also grew enough trust in our team that we can have the capacity\
    \ to hire a data engineer. This was totally a game changer. From there, we started\
    \ moving more freely. The team \u2013 the analysts \u2013 could focus more on\
    \ the analytic side and the backend, since we had an engineer who gave us a lot\
    \ of care and information, which is really good."
  sec: 904
  time: '15:04'
  who: Tammy
- line: "Basically, the first person you hired was a data analyst to help you create\
    \ dashboards. But then you realized that you need to have a lot of historical\
    \ data that you need to process \u2013 that you needed to start somewhere. This\
    \ was quite difficult for you, even though you like coding. You also said that\
    \ you asked for help but this was taking forever, so that's why you hired a data\
    \ engineer. From that point, you had your data warehouse, and building models\
    \ became easier."
  sec: 995
  time: '16:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I was actually able to configure the data warehouse. With Stage, I\
    \ was using the options in the market and I was very proud that I was learning\
    \ a lot. But it was not enough to keep pace with the growth. Then, just to finish\
    \ up the flow, the next step was hiring another data scientist in order to go\
    \ more in-depth and bring more statistical model building and more in-depth data\
    \ knowledge to the team. Then we realized, since our company's not really AI/ML\
    \ driven, it\u2019s more about analytics and serving the business to provide insights.\
    \ Having this side of business communication is very important."
  sec: 1031
  time: '17:11'
  who: Tammy
- line: "As the data team we need to work a lot, because if we do not tell the team\
    \ what we are producing, the tools are developed, but they just sit there and\
    \ no one uses them. So we would just be wasting our time and energy. Therefore,\
    \ the last person that we incorporated in our team is called a business analyst\
    \ /data researcher, whose main job is to communicate from our team to the business\
    \ side. We would publish something like a weekly, five bullet newsletter \u2013\
    \ a quick image graph to show business insights and the updates of the team and\
    \ finishing with a meme. Then some workshops we're doing with a company to introduce\
    \ our latest developments. That's the current project picture and we're looking\
    \ to grow it more this year."
  who: Tammy
- header: Role of business analyst
- line: "That's interesting, especially the last role you mentioned \u2013 this business\
    \ analyst/data researcher. The problem you had there when you were growing your\
    \ team was that you realized you have these tools \u2013 you have these dashboards,\
    \ you have these web services \u2013 but people were hesitant to use them? Or\
    \ what was the problem?"
  sec: 1121
  time: '18:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. A big part of our OPR of the data team is to build data culture. We\
    \ realize that if we put in very advanced things in the data part, it is not helpful.\
    \ We need to move forward with the whole team. That effort, since everyone is\
    \ so busy with the day-to-day workflow, no one is doing it. When you're giving\
    \ a presentation and diverting the data scientists from their daily workflow,\
    \ it's something they are not 100% interested in. That\u2019s how we realized\
    \ that we had a need for this role."
  sec: 1139
  time: '18:59'
  who: Tammy
- line: "So data scientists should be doing this but that's not their main focus \u2013\
    \ they would rather spend time doing models?"
  sec: 1176
  time: '19:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Or if data scientists do pass on knowledge or share information, it could
    be more within the team. But to communicate with the business side or answer quarter
    questions, it's a different profile.
  sec: 1185
  time: '19:45'
  who: Tammy
- line: Yeah, that's quite interesting. So you have a data analyst, you have a data
    engineer, you have data scientists, and you have a business analyst. And then
    you as leader of the team, right?
  sec: 1199
  time: '19:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 1213
  time: '20:13'
  who: Tammy
- line: So, five people in total. Did I miss anyone?
  sec: 1214
  time: '20:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No. But maybe soon. We\u2019re looking for more profiles."
  sec: 1217
  time: '20:17'
  who: Tammy
- line: Can you already share what kind of profiles you are looking for?
  sec: 1221
  time: '20:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: We're looking at hiring a senior analyst.
  sec: 1226
  time: '20:26'
  who: Tammy
- line: Ah, so the analyst needs some help.
  sec: 1229
  time: '20:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. It\u2019s more about growing the team and to sort of grow a bigger vision\
    \ and have even more ambitious goals."
  sec: 1233
  time: '20:33'
  who: Tammy
- line: "Yeah. You mentioned that you did your Master\u2019s in Barcelona. Then after\
    \ graduating, you started this position, right? Or was there something in between?"
  sec: 1242
  time: '20:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No, I was working with Glovo while I was on Master\u2019s. I started as an\
    \ intern and then went full time. Then for some personal reasons, I had to leave\
    \ for a while. Then I joined Platanomelon."
  sec: 1255
  time: '20:55'
  who: Tammy
- line: "Because I'm wondering \u2013 that sounds like a lot of responsibility being\
    \ the first data person in a company. You really need to know a lot to be able\
    \ to be useful, right? You need to know things about processes, how exactly you\
    \ collect data, how you get insights from data. You already knew this from Glovo?\
    \ Or you had to learn most of this stuff?"
  sec: 1267
  time: '21:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. I don't think you necessarily need to know a lot. Rather you should\
    \ be ready to learn a lot. When I joined the job, as I said, I had no idea \u2013\
    \ I needed to do ETL/ELT, data warehouse, engineering, web app deployment  \u2013\
    \ I learned all these."
  sec: 1296
  time: '21:36'
  who: Tammy
- line: I hope you at least kept the slides from your data engineering course.
  sec: 1321
  time: '22:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Well, I believe I was more doing research to search for new products. The\
    \ space is changing so fast \u2013 materials from two years ago might already\
    \ be outdated."
  sec: 1328
  time: '22:08'
  who: Tammy
- line: I guess that since you don't have a large team, most of the solutions you
    use there, you're not building them in-house. You use some off-the-shelf solutions.
    Right?
  sec: 1341
  time: '22:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 1351
  time: '22:31'
  who: Tammy
- header: "Platanomelon\u2019s stack"
- line: What kind of stack do you have?
  sec: 1352
  time: '22:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: "We started with Stitch and we are on GCP. In terms of the data engineering\
    \ process, we're using DBT. Then in terms of visualization, BI, we're using Google\
    \ Data Studio. Am I missing something? I think one thing that is very important\
    \ is how we deliver to the businesses \u2013 we built an internal Wiki for data.\
    \ We have a Notion where we do our analysis and track our workflows to present\
    \ links of dashboards and everything to the company."
  sec: 1354
  time: '22:34'
  who: Tammy
- header: Order for growing the data team
- line: "Yeah, that's interesting. Thanks. When I was preparing for the interview,\
    \ I took a look at your LinkedIn profile and then there was a line for your \u2018\
    current job\u2019 that said that your responsibility is \u201Cbuilding a leading\
    \ data team to provide accurate, timely, and useful insights to empower the company\
    \ to make the best decision possible.\u201D That's quite a packed sentence. I\
    \ was wondering if we could deconstruct it a little bit. There are many, many\
    \ different parts and I think like every word here means a lot. I'm interested\
    \ to know what exactly you are doing there. Because I think every word here sounds\
    \ very interesting. Let's talk a bit about this and deconstruct it."
  sec: 1391
  time: '23:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Maybe we can start with \u201Cbuilding and leading data teams.\u201D I think\
    \ we already talked about this to a large extent, like how exactly you realized\
    \ who you needed and in which order. Maybe the question I have is \u2013 say if\
    \ you needed to do this again, would you hire people in the same order? Or what\
    \ kind of order do you think is a good one?"
  who: Alexey

    \ and then develop some fancy algorithm.\u201D But then you realize the business\
    \ doesn\u2019t really need it and you're just spending your efforts developing\
    \ something that's going to be hidden in the corner of the website. So I think\
    \ this alignment with business is super super key. We have a very big product\
    \ mindset. Every product we're doing, no matter if it\u2019s a very simple task\
    \ or a big project that lasts months or even years to develop, every step of the\
    \ phase, we deliver a product that the business can interact with and use. Then\
    \ they can give us feedback. So it's very key for us. Our mission is to serve\
    \ the business and what we deliver has to be useful."

    \ who makes sure that the team is working on something that matters. I guess there\
    \ is also an educational component. Now you have a dashboard, how do you show\
    \ that it is useful? So how do you actually show that? You build the dashboard,\
    \ you know it's useful. You know that you can make a lot of useful decisions on\
    \ top of that. How do you go about convincing the business operations team and\
    \ other teams to base their decisions on these dashboards? Or on your services?"

    \ new \u2013 that\u2019s difficult. Not everyone's an early adopter that\u2019\
    s eager to see more things about data. So to tackle that, we do a lot of workshops\
    \ and informal sessions on data to the company in order to build data culture.\
    \ At the beginning we were doing it more as a lecture, like \u201COh, here is\
    \ our newly developed dashboard. Here you can find A. There you can find B. And\
    \ if you've got a question about C, you can find it there.\u201D We've realized\
    \ that even after the session, people came back and asked us for information that\
    \ they can find in the dashboard. So we were like \u201CThis is not effective.\
    \ People are not really listening.\u201D So now we changed this session to a Q&A\
    \ format, which is more like \u201COkay, now we have this question. Where should\
    \ we go?\u201D You give people some time to answer and then people can guess whatever,\
    \ or they find the answer. And then we show them the pass to find the solution.\
    \ That is proven to be much more effective. You catch more attention and people\
    \ engage better. From this step-to-step we're building data culture. Many things\
    \ like that."

    the cross-section between data and sustainability is not. Actually that poses
    a challenge for us, either to find more profiles in the space or to find a bigger
    audience who will echo with us. But we do believe there's a huge potential and
    for now, really, the mission is to learn. For myself, the biggest gain is that
