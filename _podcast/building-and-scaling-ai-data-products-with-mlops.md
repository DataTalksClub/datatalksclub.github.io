description: Build scalable data products with MLOps roadmaps, customer research and metric-driven templates - prioritize impact, reduce failures, and measure success
intro: How do you move from proofs-of-concept to scalable AI data products that deliver measurable business value? In this episode, Greg Coquillo, a Technology Manager at Amazon who builds AI roadmaps for Private Brands’ product safety and compliance, walks through practical approaches for building and scaling data products, MLOps, customer research, and metrics. <br><br> We cover Greg’s transition into AI product work and the role of data product managers (internal vs. external), then dive into customer journey mapping, domain knowledge, and structured customer research—interview techniques, documentation, the Five Whys, and hypothesis testing. You’ll hear how to work backwards from business problems, contribute technical input to roadmaps with T‑shirt sizing, and prioritize MLOps by spotting unscalable manual processes. Greg outlines three‑year roadmap thinking (impact, effort, cost), a pragmatic Excel template (problems → solutions → metrics), and SMART and operational metrics like pipeline failures, SLAs, and data quality. He also addresses operating without a PM, aligning team mental models, and on‑the‑job product skill development. <br><br> Listen to learn actionable methods for roadmap planning, MLOps prioritization, customer research, and defining success metrics for AI-driven data products

- header: Episode Introduction & Guest Overview
- line: This week, we'll talk about learning product management. We have a special
    guest today, Greg. Greg works as a technology manager at Amazon, where he builds
    AI products from the ground up. You've probably seen him many times on LinkedIn
    where he shares a lot of useful resources. Welcome to our event, Greg.
  sec: 66
  time: '1:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you so much, Alexey. Thank you for having me, letting me talk to you
    and lending the ears of the audience today as well. Hopefully, you're doing great
    on your side and that your year is off to a good start.
  sec: 88
  time: '1:28'
  who: Greg
- header: Career Background & Transition to AI Products
- line: Thanks for joining us. So before we go into our main topic of product management,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 103
  time: '1:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. I started in manufacturing – I'm an industrial engineer. I also
    have a Master's in engineering management with a focus around supply chain and
    business. In manufacturing, I had the opportunity to rotate around different positions,
    whether it's supply chain ops management, quality/safety management. In manufacturing
    I also had a chance to be a product manager who was responsible for value chain
    optimization, and especially pricing optimization, which was very fun. That was
    before I joined Amazon in building some systems that are either AI-based or non-AI-based,
    which make sure to keep customers safe when they go online and purchase the products.
  sec: 114
  time: '1:54'
  who: Greg
- line: So you were managing actual products, I mean, physical products before that,
    right?
  sec: 165
  time: '2:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Before that, it was physical products and understanding the value chain
    from the time you put a strategy towards purchasing raw materials to putting a
    strategy behind where you want to manufacture these products – how much it costs
    you to produce them, which are the distribution centers, the price of the products,
    and the marketing strategy – all that stuff. All of these strategies in data that
    you're pulling – the role is to optimize the margin for all of these products
    given that you're creating value for the customers that you serve as a B2B company
    in the chemical industry.
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Greg
- line: It was quite interesting to be able to collaborate with different groups from
    the commercial team, sales folks, and also finance, marketing, and transportation
    teams. It was good to be kind of in the middle, and to coordinate all of this
    – to make sure that the execution of each department was done on time and delivered
    exactly what the customer expected to receive or beyond.
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Greg
- line: So a product manager is not an IT-specific role, right?
  sec: 259
  time: '4:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. I would say, it even varies by department and not only by company. Instead
    of a company, there could be different roles a product manager can take. My latest
    role in the manufacturing setting as a product manager was developing what I call
    “data products”. What I call data products is kind of like a hub aggregator of
    data that provides certain services to its clients. My clients were internal –
    when you think about a group of sales folks who often struggle to understand where
    to get data, how to get data, and perform some quick analysis to make quick decisions
    or informed decisions.
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Greg
- line: I would build key dashboards that were run on top of curated pipelines. That
    helped them build different things such as putting together a contract in less
    than five days, where they are able to explore the distribution routings, the
    transportation capacity, assess the clients’ demand over a period of time, forecast
    this demand, assess the pricing, assess the pricing of their competitors, work
    with marketing data to understand what kind of discount this customer needs to
    have, or even understanding what the historical data of that customer was – to
    understand what kind of new value proposition they can put on the table for that
    customer.
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Greg
- line: The goal was to generate these kinds of contracts very fast so they don't
    lose the opportunity to book long-term contracts with these customers. For that,
    they needed access to curated data and to minimize the time it takes to transform
    that data in order to generate insights.
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Greg
- header: Role & Responsibilities of Data Product Managers (Internal vs External)
- line: That's quite a lot of things. You mentioned marketing, pricing, transportation,
    and then building this internal data product. Is this what a typical product manager
    does? Let's take a data team at a usual IT company, not a manufacturing company.
    Let's say the company has a website – could be an ecommerce website. What could
    the role of a product manager be in the data team of such a company? What are
    they usually responsible for?
  sec: 401
  time: '6:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's good to make the distinction between data product management and traditional
    product management. In traditional product management, there are a lot of data
    products that are being sold to external customers – that are being managed, developed,
    and implemented via the traditional product management principles and best practices.
    What I’m talking about, specifically, is data product management for products
    that are being served internally. In this case, your customers are sales folks,
    marketing, finance, supply chain – any program teams that can leverage these services,
    or these products, to consume and make decisions that generate value for the company.
  sec: 433
  time: '7:13'
  who: Greg
- line: When we think about the traditional product management best practices versus
    data product management best practices, they have a common principle that they
    both share, which is to always start with your customers needs – always start
    with identifying the customers’ pain points, and then derive a strategy for addressing
    that pain point. This is where they both come together under that same principle,
    from which they can work backwards to figure out how to devise a solution for
    these problems – pain points – and also how they can build a roadmap based on
    agreed upon strategy that they can deliver for the customer in order to generate
    value.
  sec: 433
  time: '7:13'
  who: Greg
- line: Most of the time, generating value means that the service or the agreement
    that this product has made is served with regards to expected service-level agreement.
    Whatever the problem these customers are facing, the mission of that product is
    to solve that problem. If you think about a sandwich, the mission of that sandwich
    is to fill up the belly to satisfy somebody's hunger, for example. After the customer
    consumes that sandwich, the mission is that hunger goes away. Just a simple example
    of the term. And if you look at the simple definition of a product by itself,
    it simply means “an artifact or a substance that is manufactured into a service”.
    So it’s manufactured into a final output that generates value for a consumer.
  sec: 433
  time: '7:13'
  who: Greg
- line: Basically, the role of a product manager is to identify the needs of a customer,
    think how these needs can be addressed, and then derive a vision/strategy. Then
    you said that they work backwards and eventually build the service that solves
    this particular pain point – this need. This whole thing – this service – is what
    a product is, right? It’s something that solves a particular problem for a particular
    group of people.
  sec: 634
  time: '10:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s correct.
  sec: 667
  time: '11:07'
  who: Greg
- line: Then you mentioned that it is common for both traditional product managers
    and data product managers – both have clients and both solve problems, except
    that in one case, traditional product managers solve problems of external clients,
    while data product managers usually address the needs of internal clients. Is
    that right?
  sec: 668
  time: '11:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. For example, in data product management there could be a recommendation
    system, which is something that I would call a data product. A recommendation
    system is often used by external customers. Therefore, a traditional product manager
    is capable of managing a recommendation system, given that this product manager
    gathers specific skills to manage these recommendation systems. Let's explore
    some of the skills in general. You're talking about designing skills, strategy,
    analytical skills, and technical skills – in other words, skills that let you
    become able to manage a data product for external customers and to be able to
    have conversations with engineers from a technical design/technical implementation
    or architecture perspective.
  sec: 692
  time: '11:32'
  who: Greg
- line: A recommendation system can be managed through traditional product management,
    but a leg up that traditional product management has is that there is this UX
    design aspect of it, where, for example, these products can be served on the website,
    they have a good design on the website. Whereas internally, when you think about
    pure data products, the UX design is probably lacking – meaning you're collecting
    all of the data, aggregating them under one roof, and then serving them to downstream
    clients who can consume that. Think about how you would design a user interface
    for something like this. There are limitations. There's an opportunity for internal
    data product management to invite UX designers to understand how to design that
    user interface for them. I'm hoping I'm making the distinction between the two.
  sec: 692
  time: '11:32'
  who: Greg
- header: Customer Journey & Domain Knowledge for Data Professionals
- line: With all these responsibilities – regardless whether it’s internal or external
    – it's quite a lot of things to do for a product manager. In your opinion, why
    is it useful for data professionals who are not product managers, such as data
    analysts, data engineers, data scientists – why could it be a good idea to also
    learn a bit of product management?
  sec: 843
  time: '14:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it helps because it prepares your mental model for always starting
    at the end – with the end in mind. “End in mind” meaning that you’re envisioning
    a “North Star” service or product that addresses key pain points for your customers.
    With that mental model, you're capable of figuring out “Who are the stakeholders
    that allow you to fulfill this mission?” With that, they are also capable of understanding
    the customer journey, which is a key part of designing a solution for your customers.
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Greg
- line: What that gives you, as a data analyst or data scientist, or any other data
    professional, is the ability to acquire domain knowledge. If you're able to express
    and understand the customer journey for a data product, served on web, for example,
    being able to design express details of that customer journey from the time they
    enter the website, navigate through, click the different products until conversion
    – meaning until they accept to purchase the product or service and consume it
    and feel satisfied – being able to map that out is something that will make you
    a more powerful data analyst, a more powerful data scientist, or a more powerful
    data professional. Being able to acquire these skills can only help to bridge
    the gap between technical and non-technical teams.
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Greg
- line: What is a customer journey? I think I understood from your description that
    this is a journey that a customer makes. So let's say they want to purchase a
    pair of headphones – they go to an ecommerce website. First, they need to find
    what they need, – wireless or wired headphones, big ones, small ones. So first,
    they look for what they need, then maybe look at reviews and then finally they
    make a decision, click the “Buy” button, and then enter their credit card details.
    A few days later they unpack their thing and start listening to music. So that's
    the journey, right?
  sec: 1000
  time: '16:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's the customer journey. Exactly. If you're the product manager for the
    website that serves all these products – headphones and things like that – whether
    you're a product manager or a data professional, you need to understand that customer
    journey. You can design key solutions, once you identify those pain points, or
    the roadblocks that would prevent a customer from purchasing your product.
  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Greg
- line: How can I understand the customer journey better? Let's say as a data scientist
    – what do I do for that?
  sec: 1074
  time: '17:54'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Customer Research Techniques: Interviews & Documentation'
- line: Obviously, you will not be able to be on the grassroots of things where you're
    deep diving all the time. So that's why you need different teams. The best practice
    is probably to do interviews. Most of the time, data scientists don't have access
    to the external customers, or the final consumers. Therefore, it's best to interview
    your business partners, the product managers, or the department heads, business
    analysts, etc. to help understand the current standard operating procedures or
    operational steps when transactions are made for that product.
  sec: 1081
  time: '18:01'
  who: Greg
- line: That's probably the best way – read documentation about these processes –
    at this point, you will be able to gain knowledge. But one of the most powerful
    tools that people often forget to use, which is available to us all, is the will
    to ask questions, or rather people forget to ask the right questions at first.
    Asking the right questions comes with experience. When you're new in the field
    of data science or anything like that, I always find that those who become very
    powerful, very effective, and very efficient, are the ones who are willing to
    ask a lot of questions so they can learn and adjust and discover. This is a soft
    skill that's definitely needed when it comes to discovering domain knowledge.
    Good data scientists, or good data professionals, are good detectives. That's
    probably the best way I can think about that.
  sec: 1081
  time: '18:01'
  who: Greg
- line: So you need to be a good detective and find business partners, business analysts,
    product managers, domain experts – and ask them questions. It doesn't have to
    be great questions. You just need to ask something to understand the topic better.
    With time, you will learn how to ask the right questions.
  sec: 1204
  time: '20:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely.
  sec: 1226
  time: '20:26'
  who: Greg
- header: Structuring Interviews with Business Partners & the Five Whys
- line: You mentioned that people need to interview. How would you go about interviewing
    these business partners – how would you structure this? Let's say we want to set
    up a meeting just to learn more about the customer journey, more about operations.
    First, you just find a domain expert and then schedule a meeting with them. So
    how do you structure this meeting? How do you structure this interview? What do
    you ask them?
  sec: 1228
  time: '20:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: What I would advise in that case is, again – start with the end in mind. It's
    not good to just schedule a meeting without a structure. That's why I like this
    questioning strategy, because you want to set a meeting with purpose. What is
    the purpose of setting up the meeting? Are you setting up a meeting to simply
    learn the general operations of the business? Or are you trying to surface the
    pain points of the business? Or are you trying to learn what the key goals are
    and then setting up a framework for identifying what the obstacles are that could
    prevent you from reaching these key business goals? Or are you trying to surface
    opportunities that will create an uptick or an increase in those metrics that
    help you reach those business goals?
  sec: 1258
  time: '20:58'
  who: Greg
- line: Start with the purpose of the meeting. Most of the time, it's to understand
    what the business is trying to do, which is understanding what the business goals
    are. Then you need to create a list of questions to identify the different obstacles
    that you're experiencing – that are posing a threat to reaching these goals, or
    even identifying the current limitations you have that could represent a threat
    to reach these goals. Then these data scientists can go back and figure out how
    to generate, or deploy, new features that allow them to reduce these limitations,
    add more capabilities, or remove obstacles so that these goals can be met.
  sec: 1258
  time: '20:58'
  who: Greg
- line: How do you identify these obstacles? What kind of questions to ask? Is it
    like, “Okay, tell me about your day? What are you struggling with?” Or what kind
    of questions should be asked?
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Alexey
- header: Hypothesis Testing & Working Backwards from Business Problems
- line: Yeah. That can be done through some specific use cases, right? One of the
    most famous ones could be, “Well, last year, we made a million dollars (for easy
    numbers) and last year, around the same time, we're already at a million dollars
    in the year. This year we're down 30% compared to last year. We're not making
    money and we're trying to figure out what's going on.” There are a lot of frameworks,
    and me being from manufacturing, I typically go with the “five whys” when I interview
    people. “Well, why do you think that's happening?” “Well, customers are leaving
    us. They're not going to the website anymore to purchase.” Asking those “five
    why's” allows you to gather preliminary answers from the business, which most
    of the time I think data professionals can take with a grain of salt.
  sec: 1400
  time: '23:20'
  who: Greg
- line: Business folks tend to leverage their intuition and their experience about
    the market to kind of deduct certain things. That is if they didn't have time
    to deep dive into data. This is where data scientists, or data professionals,
    can go back into the data and kind of reconcile these hypotheses, or make correlations
    between what they've first heard about the problems. With that, that could be
    a reason why customer churns are happening. With proper design skills, they can
    understand how to address this or find the root cause.
  sec: 1400
  time: '23:20'
  who: Greg
- line: For example, for customer churn, they can find out whether it was due to a
    feature that was released on the website that caused the customers to be confused,
    and miss clicking the “Buy” button since that feature launch, which has caused
    a reduction in sales. So all of these “working backwards” tasks help you identify
    what happened. Maybe it was an external event that happened. For example, let's
    say that COVID was the event that caused a downturn in your sales. Being able
    to work backwards to figure out that root cause is what data scientists can do
    when they're analyzing data.
  sec: 1400
  time: '23:20'
  who: Greg
- header: Product Sense & Product Mindset Explained
- line: Yeah, thank you. We have a question from Peter. Actually, I have a similar
    one. The question from Peter is, “What is product sense?” What I would add to
    this is – is it similar to the product mindset? To me, they seem like synonyms
    “product sense”, “product mindset”. What are these things? Do you know?
  sec: 1585
  time: '26:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Product sense? I don't hear that term often, but I have an idea. There's no
    firm definition for this. Product sense to me is a mindset, I would say – the
    mindset of being able to understand the characteristics and limitations of your
    product with regards to your customers’ needs and being able to derive a roadmap
    and strategy that address these expected and unexpected needs of your customers.
  sec: 1609
  time: '26:49'
  who: Greg
- line: It’s about understanding the trends of these products, the trends of the market,
    the trends of your customers’ behaviors – because needs change over time. A product
    sense to me is more of a mindset that entails different things from understanding
    the external and internal forces that drive the performance of your product.
  sec: 1609
  time: '26:49'
  who: Greg
- line: This is something that everyone can have? It's not only a thing that product
    managers can have, but everyone on the team, every data professional, non-data
    professional, frontend engineer, backend engineer – everyone can have that. Right?
    It's about understanding the characteristics of your product and understanding
    the limitations. You also mentioned defining roadmaps and strategies. This is
    also part of that. So how, as the data professional, can I take part in defining
    a roadmap? I assume this is usually what a product manager does. So how can I
    help my product manager work on the roadmap? And what do I need for that?

- line: If you're a data professional, you're on the business team as a data analyst,
    a business analyst, or you're on the tech side, even an ML engineer or a data
    engineer, etc. Since product roadmaps are led by product managers, the best practice
    is involving all your stakeholders into this. You need to understand whether you
    will be able to deliver what you're promised to deliver. That, especially the
    technical side, will be responsible for “T-shirt sizing” the efforts it takes
    to deploy the key features of your product.
  sec: 1733
  time: '28:53'
  who: Greg
- line: As a data professional, the contribution that you can make is to provide that
    “T said sizing” in terms of effort. For example, if a feature requires the build
    of key data pipelines that require real time inference from machine learning,
    a data professional on the technical side is responsible for providing advice
    and aligning on timeline to ensure that the underlying infrastructure is either
    present or there's a strategy for establishing that infrastructure which gives
    you those key pipelines, which in turn enable these features that you want to
    release in an XYZ timeframe.
  sec: 1733
  time: '28:53'
  who: Greg
- line: When you think about it, it's definitely something that data professionals
    are already doing. It's a matter of whether your organization is applying these
    best practices where product managers are inviting everybody at the table to provide
    their opinions and advice on how to move the needle.
  sec: 1733

    it into smaller things?
  sec: 1874
  time: '31:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: “T shirt sizing” is simply providing “How long does it take? What is the cost
    of me spending time to build this? How long will it take me to build this?” etc.
    Basically, it's determining the effort that it takes to build something.

- header: 'Working Backwards: Problem‑First Feature Design'
- line: I guess another thing – I'm not sure if we talked about this – but you mentioned
    it a few times that you should start with an end in mind. I guess this is something
    that we can also do. Let's say, when we discuss any feature, we can say “Let's
    think about what kind of problem we're solving for the customer.” Right? Then
    we work backwards on that problem, instead of trying to come up with a solution
    that is technically interesting, or good, but doesn't really solve the problem.
  sec: 1905
  time: '31:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. If you think about a product manager, a data scientist’s customer
    is the product manager in this case, right? When the product manager comes up
    with this roadmap which has a list of features that are prioritized based on the
    ones that speak closer to the business goals, then, the data scientist needs to
    work backwards from this – to figure out how that solution will be delivered.
    It’s not up to the product manager to dictate how that solution will be delivered.
  sec: 1935
  time: '32:15'
  who: Greg
- line: For example, as a product manager, I cannot go to the engineers and say, “Use
    this tech stack and use it to deliver this feature.” It should be the engineer’s
    responsibility to tell me what the best solution to achieve this is. Their role
    is to gather the requirements from me, meaning “This feature requires high availability,
    high concurrency, low latency, etc, etc.” And then they figure out how to design
    the final product for me for the final release.
  sec: 1935
  time: '32:15'
  who: Greg
- line: Okay. So you would say that a PM is more problem-oriented and a data scientist
    is more solution-oriented, right?
  sec: 2017
  time: '33:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: They're both solution-oriented, if you think about it. A PM is solution-oriented
    for their customer and a data scientist is solution oriented for their customer,
    who's the PM. A PM is solution-oriented for their customer, who’s the external
    consumer. So it depends on which angle you're looking at this. They're both working
    in tandem to provide a solution for the ones they serve. You can abstract that
    to any position. Whether you're an accountant, or a supply chain manager, or you’re
    a buyer, or a planner of production – you're serving a downstream customer. And
    you can create a roadmap.
  sec: 2024
  time: '33:44'
  who: Greg
- line: This is why when you think about a roadmap, to me, that's one of the most
    powerful skills. Knowing how to build a roadmap is a very powerful tool to use
    for career advancement. You don't have to be a product manager to be able to build
    a roadmap for yourself as a supply chain manager, for example. That shows leadership
    – that you're thinking beyond your daily activities. You're thinking about the
    future transformation of your business. And that’s what gets you promoted, because
    you're thinking about future transformation. You’re thinking about improvement.
    You’re thinking about the growth of your department. It's a great skill to have.
    It's a great tool to use. It shouldn't be limited to product managers only.

    product manager to help me? Or how do I go about that?
  sec: 2134
  time: '35:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Now, when I say “roadmap,” a data scientist building a roadmap is different
    from a product manager building a roadmap. A roadmap built by a data scientist
    and their group members – that’s going to be about building the underlying infrastructure
    that helps them better serve their clients. For example, a group of product managers
    may come up with 10,000 business use cases that require some sort of ML algorithm
    to address these use cases. In a sense, you can have a group of data scientists
    who strategize on how to implement certain frameworks, in this case, to keep up
    with all of these demands.
  sec: 2143
  time: '35:43'
  who: Greg
- line: What I call “demands” are – all of these business use cases are coming out,
    these product managers are coming to knock on their door and saying, “Hey, I need
    help.” That's a good use case for building a roadmap for ML Ops. So figuring out
    all of the different components of ML Ops, assessing where you are today, and
    where you want to go tomorrow, to fully deploy an ML Ops framework that allows
    you to keep up with all that demand. That ML Ops framework provides you with the
    right supply that meets the demand of the business teams.
  sec: 2143
  time: '35:43'
  who: Greg
- line: Again, a roadmap for the technical side may be different from a roadmap for
    a business non-tech side. But it's the same process with regards to having to
    focus on the customer in mind. You don't want me to come up with a bunch of requests
    and you can't answer to any of these requests because you don't have the underlying
    infrastructure to support my demands, right? So you gotta have a plan to be able
    to respond to this increased capacity here. Again, I'm thinking about manufacturing.
  sec: 2143
  time: '35:43'
  who: Greg
- line: What I also heard from you – I don't know if it's the right summary or not
    – but let's say people come to me as a data scientist with problems, and these
    are usually product managers, or maybe product analysts, or other people. So they
    come to me with problems and for me, the ability to generalize all these problems
    and then see the bigger picture, and then put all these problems into a roadmap
    and say, “Okay, with this thing we can solve this bunch of problems. With this
    thing, we can solve this bunch of problems.” And then you see the bigger picture.
    This is what I mean by coming up with a roadmap, right?
  sec: 2306
  time: '38:26'
  who: Alexey
- header: Identifying Unscalable Manual Processes & ML Ops Prioritization
- line: Coming up with a roadmap is kind of like understanding what strategy you will
    use to serve your customers. Meaning “Are you going to deploy a project or assign
    a group of tech folks to each product project that your customers come up with?
    Or are you going to build a framework that can scale to address these needs? Do
    you have a process in place to understand which of your models can be reused or
    repurposed for different business use cases?” Versus having to go through the
    long cycle of project management. All of that is about, “What is the vision for
    your data or tech department?” To serve its client. How you build that vision
    is by identifying the issues, or the obstacles, that you've seen along the road
    when you're working through an unscalable way.
  sec: 2341
  time: '39:01'
  who: Greg
- line: And what is that? What is this non-scalable way?
  sec: 2422
  time: '40:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I say “unscalable” I mean the “manual” way. If you're having to allocate
    time, effort, people, resources, for each business use case that comes to you
    – which is a long cycle of Project Lifecycle Management – versus having an ML
    Ops infrastructure that allows you to quickly build, test, deploy models to shorten
    these project lifecycles. So you'll have to draw that roadmap, which helps you
    get to that maturity level.
  sec: 2424
  time: '40:24'
  who: Greg
- line: Because today, you may make an assessment that helps you identify the gaps
    – whether you have the right professionals, whether you have the right tech stack,
    whether you have the right skills to manage these tech stacks. You need to decide,
    inside of that roadmap, which of these are most important. You need to go after
    this by prioritizing until you get there. So it's all about drawing the roadmap
    to reach a maturity level.
  sec: 2424
  time: '40:24'
  who: Greg
- header: 'Three‑Year Roadmap: Prioritization by Impact, Effort & Cost'
- line: I think you said “driving the roadmap” multiple times. Let's say I work in
    a team that has a product manager, and a bunch of other people. So then “driving
    the roadmap” of this team means taking active part in discussions when we talk
    about what we want to solve next, like, “Okay, I think this is the problem we
    should be focusing on right now” and being able to defend this position – to convince
    everyone on the team that this is indeed the problem. So, “We as a team should
    focus on solving this problem in the next quarter (for example).” This is what
    it means to drive the roadmap, right?
  sec: 2504
  time: '41:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: To me, a roadmap should be a three-year plan, never less or never more. It
    should be a three year plan because something that is a roadmap for five years
    – that’s quite loose. Nobody really knows what's going to happen in five years
    in terms of trends. So you have a better sense of the future trends or within
    the next three years. And then inside of those three years, you kind of prioritize
    what you want to go after. For example, if your biggest needs instead of that
    roadmap are “We need more people. We need more specialized folks. We need more
    data engineers, because we cannot keep up with these demands to build key data
    pipelines that serve different purposes. We need to hire more and better qualified
    data engineers.” Or “We need to create a strategy for putting together better
    training materials for these data engineers so they can keep up with the industry,
    etc, etc.”
  sec: 2547
  time: '42:27'
  who: Greg
- line: You identify the limitations that you have and then prioritize the solutions
    to these limitations over the next three years. You prioritize by what you need
    the most to what you need the least. You also prioritize by how much effort it
    will take, whether you want to buy third party software or you want to build it
    from the ground up, the cost, the effort, and the impact. The impact is a big
    factor, because maybe hiring more data engineers gives you a better return on
    your investment in terms of being able to create pipelines that serve downstream
    customers. Again, a roadmap is inside of three years and accounts for impact,
    effort, cost, timeline – so you can strategize on what you need to focus on.
  sec: 2547
  time: '42:27'

    skill?

  time: '44:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's a product manager skill.
  sec: 2685
  time: '44:45'
  who: Greg

    like a project that you need to finish. This is different, right?
  sec: 2687
  time: '44:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is different. Think about a roadmap as the future transformation of a
    product, a system, or a department and the strategy that helps you get there –
    from point A to point B.
  sec: 2695
  time: '44:55'
  who: Greg
- line: A three-year-long plan seems like quite a while, right? So how would you go
    about that? Like if I don't even know what will happen in one quarter or half
    a year – how do I plan for three years? To me, that's quite a long-term plan.
  sec: 2720
  time: '45:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. To me, that's more of a “think big” kind of thing. Then don't forget
    – you have a three year roadmap. If it's more than five years, then you're kind
    of shooting into the air with no aim. Three years is a good estimate of what the
    future needs are – it's being able to anticipate where the trends are going and
    being able to anticipate what the future needs of your customers will be. That
    gives you a good leg up. And remember, a roadmap is not a static strategy – it's
    an adaptive strategy.
  sec: 2737
  time: '45:37'
  who: Greg
- line: You give yourself three years, and once you have alignment on this roadmap,
    you start working at year one on what you decide is more important. But things
    change in the market and your roadmap needs to be up to date. A roadmap that you
    write for today – for the next few years – will change next year, most likely,
    because the needs of your customers will change with it. So don't think about
    the roadmap as a static document, but more of a dynamic one that provides flexibility
    and even proactiveness – being able to anticipate what your customers will do
    and what their needs will be.

    “How can we best develop our roadmap-building skills?” Is there a good resource,
    maybe there is a product management course that we as data scientists can take
    in order to learn these things? Or do we just need to watch how product managers
    do their job and learn from them?
  sec: 2838
  time: '47:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know of any specific product management courses. You can probably
    YouTube or Google, “How to build a product roadmap” and kind of pull the skills
    from this and apply them to your department. But I'm not sure that there is a
    set way of doing so. You can come up with your own framework for this. For me,
    it's about starting with the end in mind – which is “What is the problem that
    you're experiencing right now?”
  sec: 2866
  time: '47:46'
  who: Greg
- line: List all of your problems in an Excel sheet, where each row has the list of
    problems and the column heads are “the problem”, “the driver of this problem”
    or “potential root cause of this problem”, then you can have another column called
    “solution” or “potential solution”. Then after the solution, you can have “justification”.
    After justification, you can have “stakeholders that will be affected”. Then you
    have “impact” – what is the impact of that solution? Is it customer experience
    improvement? Is it an uplift in sales that the solution gives you? Then you have
    a column for “effort” where you can estimate it – if you're already on the tech
    side, you can better understand what the effort will be for that solution. Then
    you have SMART goals. The SMART metric for that solution is time bound and measurable.
    That’s another column that I would add in a roadmap. Then the last column, I would
    say, would be “prioritization.” Is it priority number one? Number two, number
    three?
  sec: 2866
  time: '47:46'
  who: Greg
- line: Then once you fill out all of that Excel file, you can filter by priority
    – where you prioritize P1s first. Then in terms of that SMART goal, you will know
    when you need to deliver based on the effort. There will be trade-offs – there
    could be something with high impact that may take six months to build. Are you
    going to prioritize that versus prioritizing three smaller effort solutions that
    when combined can give you the same impact as working on one that can give you
    a big impact. So you have to understand how to make trade-offs between all of
    the things in this list. So there you go – I just created a weak framework for
    building a roadmap for your department.

- line: Yeah, thanks. That's useful. Also, there is a question from Elena about setting
    up metrics for an internal data platform. I think that's also interesting and
    this is something that I think product managers also do, right? Let's say we have
    a problem that we want to solve. Now, we need to think, “How can we actually measure
    that we are solving this problem?” Is this something that product managers do?
  sec: 3071
  time: '51:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's a product management 101, especially in designing solutions for their
    customers. You want to identify the affected customers and the pain points. You
    want to brainstorm what that “Northstar” is for these pain points – meaning the
    vision of a product that would solve these pain points. Also you want to describe
    exactly what that question is asking – describe what the success criteria is.
    Success criteria are where you embed success metrics.
  sec: 3099
  time: '51:39'
  who: Greg
- line: For you, a solution may be that you want to reduce latency of the data pipelines
    that you serve to the downstream team, for example. Or you want to reduce the
    SLA (service level agreement) for your teams. You want to increase engagement
    on your website by 10%. You want to reduce customer churn. Product management
    design 101 – success criteria. Success metrics are key to monitor and validate
    that the solution you've implemented was effective.
  sec: 3099
  time: '51:39'
  who: Greg
- line: This comes to the SMART framework that you mentioned. The M there is “measurable”.
    So we always need to think about a way to measure that we're actually solving
    this problem, right?

    I can imagine myself, “What kind of problems might I have with a data platform?”
    Maybe there are data quality issues, right? And then, “How can we measure that?”
    Well, fewer people complain, for example, or some other ways of measuring that.
    Then it can become your success criteria – fewer people complain about quality.
    So we can track complaints and then after half a year – if there are no complaints,
    we can call it successful.
  sec: 3207
  time: '53:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Also pipeline failures, for example. “Are you experiencing less pipeline failures?
    Are you addressing your pipeline failures within the service level agreement that
    you're established? For example, you may say, “High priority business-critical
    pipelines – when they fail, you have a service level agreement of 48 hours.” So
    your success criteria is anything 48 hours or under – you can use that as a metric.
    You can say “98% of your business-critical pipeline failures will be addressed
    inside of that agreed upon service level agreement.” So with that, 98% is your
    success metric. So you need to do that or exceed it. That's another metric for
    internal data platforms. There are many others that you can think of, but that's
    one easy one that I can think about.
  sec: 3242
  time: '54:02'
  who: Greg

    roadmap, you do the Excel spreadsheet – if you fill in all the columns, it will

    that we're actually solving these pain points?”

    at some point. I know that what can happen in such a team is that people work
    on solving problems that don't exist. I have tried solving problems that don't

    that is not useful”? How can we make sure that our projects in such teams are
    more successful?
  sec: 3332
  time: '55:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Whether you have a product manager or not, you still have a customer.
    If you're a data science team or a data team, you're doing some work for somebody
    downstream to consume. So, the first thing I would say is identify those folks.
    Identify the business decision-makers or the decision-makers of the departments
    that you serve. Who are the decision makers? Identify them and interview them.
    Surface these pain points, and then brainstorm ideas to tackle these pain points.
    Use data to brainstorm ideas, and use data to solve these ideas. That's probably
    the most powerful thing that data scientists have, right? They use data to explore
    and they use data to solve.

  who: Greg
- line: At the end of the day, depending on the company culture, you may find that
    you don't need the middleman – you don't need the product manager to guide you
    in this journey. You just need to understand who your customers are – who you
    serve – what they are trying to solve and how to solve them. So best practice
    is – get in touch with the decision-makers.

    thought, “That's an interesting thought.” If a team no longer needs him, what

    move to learn about the skills. You can learn about these skills on the job –
    at your current job. Being open to learning a skill outside of your immediate
    responsibilities, or outside of your skill set, makes you that much more powerful
    at your current job. And it gets you promoted faster. Be open to learning something
    outside of your daily responsibilities. Hopefully everyone who listened here takes
