short: From Data Science to DataOps
title: From Data Science to DataOps
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about DataOps. We have a special guest today, Tomasz.
    Tomasz is a DataOps who lives in Poland, in Poznan. After working in product analytics,
    data engineering, data science, and machine learning, he fell in love with operations.
    He finds peace in fixing poorly-written IAM roles and teaching people. I really
    love that line. So welcome – welcome Tomasz.
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us on this kind of niche topic still.
    I hope after this podcast/vlog, it will become less niche because it deserves
    attention in my opinion. Yours probably as well.
  sec: 126
  time: '2:06'
  who: Tomasz
- header: Tomasz’s background
- line: Yeah, indeed. I'm surprised that you worked in so many different roles. Probably
    we'll start our interview with that. Before we go into our main topic of DataOps
    and becoming DataOps, let's start with your background. Can you tell us about
    your career journey so far?
  sec: 145
  time: '2:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. Well, university time should count to the career time. I studied econometrics,
    which is kind of exotic, or at least it was back then. Then, kind of accidentally,
    because a friend of mine shared the information with me that “Yeah, this company
    OLX is actually hiring.” I was like “Never heard of it.” So totally by accident,
    I joined the company as a machine learning trainee. Then I was working as a junior
    data engineer, then as a data scientist, and so on.
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Basically, alongside all these roles and positions, I believe I touched on
    a lot of steps in that whole cycle of – analyze data, create the model, publish
    the model, create the product, yada, yad, yada. So because I get easily bored
    with stuff, I try to touch as much as possible and don't become an expert on one
    particular domain or only one step like only building models or only doing the
    analysis. I wanted to know what the other folks are doing and why and how this
    connects to my own work. That's why the scope was rather broad.
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Tomasz
- line: So you tried all these positions – all these roles – while working at the
    same company? At OLX?
  sec: 271
  time: '4:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Mostly, I didn't work only at OLX. I briefly worked at the Central Statistical
    Office (Główny Urząd Statystyczny) in Poland to see what the government’s statistics
    look like. There were also some brief episodes with university and some other
    companies and yada yada yada. But mainly OLX.
  sec: 278
  time: '4:38'
  who: Tomasz
- line: You mentioned that you got into OLX as an ML trainee by accident. I think
    many of our listeners, or people who are watching this, might be wondering what
    this accident was. Can you tell us more about that?
  sec: 303
  time: '5:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I mentioned “by accident” because I haven't actually searched for it
    specifically. Yeah, I definitely wanted to be into machine learning and stuff.
    I just received a link that said, “Hey, some company is hiring for a machine learning
    internship.” I was like, “Why not?” Why this might be a little bit awkward to
    some of the listeners because right now machine learning is a hot topic. Back
    then, it's probably hard to believe but, at least in Poland, nobody pretty much
    heard of machine learning. Back then it was called multi-dimensional analysis
    at university.
  sec: 320
  time: '5:20'
  who: Tomasz
- line: I basically took the course, where I was doing all the principal component
    analysis, classification, clustering, and all that other stuff, but it wasn't
    even called machine learning. It was something like “multi-dimensional analysis”
    because a lot of folks there were from a statistical background, and they just
    had different naming conventions, let's say. So that was the “accident” [chuckles].
  sec: 320
  time: '5:20'
  who: Tomasz
- header: What Tomasz did before DataOps (Data Science)
- line: So you worked as a machine learning trainee, then you worked as a junior data
    engineer, then you also worked as a data scientist. After working as a data scientist,
    you became interested in DataOps and you became a DataOps. But before you became
    a DataOps engineer – I don't know how to properly call this role… Before you started
    doing DataOps, you were a data scientist. Can you maybe tell us what you were
    doing? What kind of tasks did you have? What kind of questions and responsibilities
    did you have?
  sec: 394
  time: '6:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I was working mainly in the under the models customer unit – OLX has
    different units, so I wasn't in the core data science team, rather, under one
    of the business units. I was doing mainly behavioral analysis, like, analyzing
    clickstream data, trying to do some models on that to capture some interesting
    signals, trying to catch people who might perform actions that we are actually
    interested in and trying to grab them basically. Also, I was doing a little bit
    of product analytics, alongside the work plus, obviously, some operations because
    that's how the DataOps journey started for me.
  sec: 428
  time: '7:08'
  who: Tomasz
- line: A lot of people might believe that if you're a data analyst, or data engineer,
    or data scientist, you don't need a lot of operational skills. That's a little
    bit of a misunderstanding, because even if you are working in data – if you are
    a programmer, you are perfectly aware that they are SREs. DevOps and stuff like
    that – in data, not really. But that might be a little bit of a context story,
    but I guess it's relevant for the discussion. So let's say you are a data engineer,
    and all of a sudden you start a new project and you need to create a new S3 bucket
    or Kinesis stream or whatever. You believe that you won't be deeply involved in
    that because there is a platform team or there is an infra team or whatever other
    team – the central core staff. So you go to them, like “Hey, folks! I need a new
    S3 bucket.” And they are like, “That's cool. Here's the link to the repository.
    Create the merge request, and we'll do the review on priority because we like
    you.” Then you’re like, “Oh, crap. I need to learn Terraform, Terragrunt, Atlantis
    and obviously a cloud provider.” So that's about “not needing to learn operational
    skills”. Or maybe as a data analyst, you also believe “Ah! I don’t need that stuff.”
    But then all of the sudden you need to actually understand the dataflow in the
    company.
  sec: 428
  time: '7:08'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Why? Because we prepared an awesome report, provided a view on some part of
    the business unit – the results are pretty important. They are about to be shown
    to the leadership and your boss asks a really uncomfy question, “How confident
    are you with the results? Because that 10% drop in the revenue looks kind of suspicious.”
    So maybe some ETL jobs failed this and that. Maybe some servers were basically
    down. Maybe there's an issue with tracking or some other stuff. So then, all of
    the sudden, you need to understand not only your path but the whole pipeline.
    Or even as a data scientist, you might be thinking “Okay. My job ends pretty much
    at the level of a Jupyter notebook and that's it. Then there will be some almighty
    Big Data team or machine learning engineers who will take that stuff and put it
    on prod.” Yes, and no. Because, for instance, you created a model where the prediction
    time is one second. The product folks came through and said, “Okay, that's cool,
    but you need to go down to 300 milliseconds. Oops.” Or you create a model that
    is outputting, let's say, a list of cookies. Some folks from marketing are like
    “That's super cool. But we don't have any possible tool that is able to consume
    it. We can consume some rules.” So now you realize “Okay, I created a model that
    is pretty much useless because the output format doesn't match.”
  sec: 428
  time: '7:08'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Those are pretty hard tasks and it's pretty unexpected for a lot of folks,
    because they believe that there will be someone else who will be doing that. That's
    not necessarily true and that's pretty much where DataOps comes in, because people
    need help in that manner. Also, there is a possibility for a huge misconception
    here. Some listeners might be thinking now “Okay. Now I finally get what DataOps
    is about. This will be the person who will create the infrastructure for me or
    who will do the maintenance for me.” Not necessarily. DataOps is the person who
    will help you work effectively, who will help you design the solution, who will
    basically make your work less scary. He will not do something for you. He will
    teach you how to do it effectively.
  sec: 428
  time: '7:08'
  who: Tomasz
- line: So in your story, you needed a bucket, you needed the Kinesis stream, and
    then you asked somebody for help and they said, “Oh, we’re busy. Create a pull
    request (or merge request, whatever).” And you were expecting that these people
    would help you, but they kind of said, “Okay, just do it yourself. Here is the
    repo. You need to create a merge request.” Right?
  sec: 760
  time: '12:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Also to, to maybe defend the platform teams a little bit, or the security
    or the SREs – they are not supposed to do that. Let's say you are asking the security
    team to create a service role for you. It will be not very responsible from their
    side to just throw out of the fence some relative stuff to someone who doesn't
    know how this thing is supposed to work. They should help you – they should do
    the review and they should guide you, but not necessarily do the job for you.
  sec: 787
  time: '13:07'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Okay. So in all these roles that you had over this time – as a data engineer,
    as a data analyst, as a data scientist – in all these instances, you needed to
    touch the infrastructure, right? And this is how you learn how to do this and
    this is how you fell in love with doing all this stuff. Is that right?
  sec: 829
  time: '13:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's totally correct.
  sec: 848
  time: '14:08'
  who: Tomasz
- header: Why Tomasz made the transition from Data science to DataOps
- line: So when did you realize that you actually enjoy doing this stuff more than
    your work as a data scientist? How did it happen?
  sec: 852
  time: '14:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm glad that this question was asked. Because, again, there are a lot of
    misconceptions about which role in data is more important than the other role.
    Before answering the question directly – no role is more important than another
    role. Especially, you might be thinking “Do I need to have a DataOps in the company?”
    The answer is “No,” which might be surprising for some folks. It's not a mission-critical
    role. It's rather more of a support role. Imagine that you're playing a game and
    you are going to the boss fight. You are going to the particular boss fight with
    a broken sword and without potions. Is it doable? Yes. Will it be fun? Probably
    not. DataOps is kind of that buff, that fixed sword, that plenty of potions, and
    stuff like that. It's useful, but not necessarily mandatory. [chuckles]
  sec: 860
  time: '14:20'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Now answering the question maybe – Why? Because I wanted to solve problems
    and it turns out – which kind of correlates with what Andrew Ng (if I'm pronouncing
    the surname correctly) discovered or is trying to make people aware of – is that
    the whole domain went recently from the model-centric approach to the data-centric
    approach. Which essentially means that, if you are doing work in some large company
    and your job is not to create the model to explain the behavior of something and
    then forget about it, but rather you are creating a data product. Surprisingly,
    the majority of the work in creating the data product is in operations – it’s
    in data and not modeling itself.
  sec: 860
  time: '14:20'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Naturally, because we were working on data products, we're solving more and
    more and more of engineering problems, not necessarily scientific ones. So that's
    how I fell in love with that stuff. But DataOps is not necessarily more important
    than data science. Actually, with Alexey, we both know a perfect example of that
    – because while I was transferring from data science to DataOps, we know one person
    who was actually doing the opposite. One SRE with plenty of experience in operations
    was going through the same bridge, but in the opposite direction – from Ops to
    data science. So no career is worse or better than another. Don't get us wrong.
  sec: 860
  time: '14:20'
  who: Tomasz
- line: I think you said at the beginning that doing the same thing for a long time
    is boring for you, because you want to do a lot of different things. And I think
    many people are like that. Right?
  sec: 1066
  time: '17:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's also a factor.
  sec: 1080
  time: '18:00'
  who: Tomasz
- line: So, not everyone but some people are – it's just too boring to keep doing
    the same thing all the time. For our colleague, it was probably boring to do Ops
    stuff all the time, and he wanted to try something else. So you were doing data
    science, and then you realized that you need to spend a lot of time doing this
    infra stuff and this is where a lot of problems are. Like you said, you love solving
    problems and I guess you saw that there are actually a lot of problems in the
    Ops part, right? The reason you became interested is (maybe I misunderstood you,
    but) you felt like “Okay, I'm more useful solving these problems and I actually
    like doing this.” That's why you started digging deeper into this.
  sec: 1083
  time: '18:03'
  who: Alexey
- header: What is DataOps?
- line: We've been talking about DataOps for quite some time, or your transition into
    this, but we didn't actually discuss what DataOps is. So what is DataOps?
  sec: 1139
  time: '18:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: I love the explanation that was given at one of the talks at DataTalks.Club,
    with Chris, if I remember correctly – the grandfather of DataOps. Essentially,
    a DataOps engineer or whoever takes a look at how people work, not doing the reports
    himself or herself, or modeling, or putting the models on prod, etc. He or she
    looks at how people work, where there might be inefficiencies, how to overcome
    them, and basically help people produce meaningful results faster, in a more pleasant,
    less scary way, and stuff like that.
  sec: 1150
  time: '19:10'
  who: Tomasz
- line: For me, that might be the shortest description possible, which is essentially
    the same stuff that DevOps are doing. If you think about that, it's not a new
    concept. Programmers knew that for some time, that's how DevOps came about. But
    even before – Lean, Kaizen, Six Sigma, stuff like that in companies that are producing
    something physically – that was there and the concepts are super similar. We are
    producing software, okay, but the philosophy is exactly the same, IMO.
  sec: 1150
  time: '19:10'
  who: Tomasz
- header: How is DataOps related to infrastructure?
- line: Okay. But how is it related to infrastructure and all these things that we
    talked about? You said DataOps is about solving inefficiencies, helping people
    overcome problems, produce results faster – how is this related to infrastructure?
  sec: 1256
  time: '20:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Excellent question. Because DataOps is not only infra, it's also about helping
    people write better SQL queries – as simple as that, or helping people keep… let's
    call them “secrets,” stored in the proper locations and accessing them the proper
    way and stuff like that. But it turns out that there’s actually a lot of confusion
    about infra like, “Okay, how should I create the S3 buckets through GitOps?” Someone
    might be like, “Okay, let's try some examples. Just switch the names and try to
    apply that and see what will happen.” But then, Atlantis returns some error, like,
    “Oh, crap, I just broke the production.” No, everything is okay.
  sec: 1276
  time: '21:16'
  who: Tomasz
- line: But for the first time, if someone never used GitOps to make some changes
    in the infra, it will be scary, honestly. So that's why it's rather a good idea
    to sit with that person on the Zoom call and go step by step. “Do you know Terraform?”
    “No.” “Do you know Terragrunt?” “No.” And blah, blah, blah, and all of the sudden,
    all the errors, all the concepts become less ambiguous and like it’s for a specialist
    – it’s getting more familiar with technology. To give it a more human face.
  sec: 1276
  time: '21:16'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Yeah. You mentioned GitOps, creating a bucket through Atlantis – can you maybe
    walk us through the process? What exactly does this process look like? Maybe high
    level without going too technical – just for those who don't know. I think I know
    a little bit, maybe. I will also check if I know how this thing actually works.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 1384
  time: '23:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m guessing you do. [chuckles] Essentially, you don’t need any stuff like
    infrastructure as code because that's Terraform, Terragrunt and all that jazz
    is for – or Cloud Formation, if you're working with AWS. It can… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1406
  time: '23:26'
  who: Tomasz
- line: What is “infrastructure as code”? Before we even go there, for those that
    don’t know.
  sec: 1422
  time: '23:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Good question. So, if you want to create something, you can also go to your
    web browser, authenticate, and you can just click here and there, and create some
    resources – some roles, some buckets, some Kinesis streams, stuff like that.
  sec: 1429
  time: '23:49'
  who: Tomasz
- line: With your mouse, in the Amazon web interface. Right?
  sec: 1446
  time: '24:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: But then, imagine that you want to create one bucket on staging and one bucket
    on production. So you are doing essentially the same stuff, which changes just
    a little bit of the S3 bucket name or some tiny details. So that's how a lot of
    smart folks in operations came to the conclusion that maybe if we define all the
    configurations, all the infrastructure as code – not as clicking here and there
    – it will be more manageable. We can do some audits. We can do all that stuff
    via merge requests, which can be reviewed. Everybody in the company will be able
    to create a merge request as they say it, and then someone from more infra teams
    will go there and check your merge requests – but everybody can do, that's the
    enablement.
  sec: 1451
  time: '24:11'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Essentially, you're writing some Terraform, which is a huge config file, let's
    put it that way. Terragrunt is putting some variables to the Terraform code and
    what Atlantis does is it displays all the changes that are about to be made in
    the pull request on the merge request, where you can review what will be changed
    if the given procedure would be applied. It's kind of a “dry run”. Then after
    you get the approval from SREs or whoever, you can just click on “merge” (or “apply”
    in Atlantis) and the changes are made to the infrastructure. That’s probably still
    a little bit technical, but that’s the high level overview.
  sec: 1451
  time: '24:11'
  who: Tomasz
- line: I'll try to summarize. We have “infrastructure as code” tools, and Terraform
    is one of them. With Terraform, we can create a config, and with this config,
    we create a bucket, we create this Kinesis thing that you mentioned – as a config,
    as code. Typically, without Git, what we would do is something like Terraform
    Apply on our computer. But with GitOps, the way we do it, is instead of getting
    this code and running this locally, we create a branch and in this branch, we
    put this piece of code and then we create a pull request or a merge request. Then
    what Atlantis does is apply Terraform or tries to see what would happen if we
    apply this to our cloud account. Then somebody – some SRE or some DevOps person
    or DataOps, if you will – comes, sees that your code is not breaking anything,
    they accept the merge request, and then you merge. At the end of this process,
    you have a bucket and the Kinesis stream in your account. Right? That’s the process?
  sec: 1581
  time: '26:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly like that. You mentioned something that I haven't. [chuckles] Essentially,
    without GitOps, you will be as Alexey said, you will be doing all that stuff from
    your laptop. So you will have to have the proper data Terraform version and all
    other tools. Now imagine some poor data analyst trying to install Terraform config
    dat. That will be painful.
  sec: 1654
  time: '27:34'
  who: Tomasz
- line: I think it was the biggest problem. At OLX, we thought that it was a good
    idea to ask data scientists to work on infrastructure and for that, they needed
    to clone this repository with Terraform and then do Terraform Apply, and then
    apply these changes to the cloud. The biggest problem was actually installing
    this and making sure you can apply. [chuckles] Many people couldn't do this, because
    it's just too difficult and this is not what data scientists are trained to do,
    typically. This is not what we learned at university. [chuckles] But I guess for
    you, you liked this part, right? You enjoyed doing this thing?
  sec: 1686
  time: '28:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes… To be a little bit more specific I haven't enjoyed…
  sec: 1728
  time: '28:48'
  who: Tomasz
- line: '[laughs] You didn''t enjoy it?'
  sec: 1739
  time: '28:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it’s just… it wasn't that much about creating the infra. I haven't fallen
    in love with creating Terraform code. It was rather about helping people do it
    – making them comfortable with that stuff. That was the main part of doing DataOps
    more for me.
  sec: 1743
  time: '29:03'
  who: Tomasz
- header: How Tomasz learned the skills necessary to become DataOps
- line: Okay. One of the questions I wanted to ask you is – how did you actually learn
    this thing? How did you become a DataOps? But I think from what I understood is,
    you just simply had to do this and then you had a Zoom call with some sort of
    SRE or platform engineer who would guide you through this process – who would
    explain to you what Terraform is, what the other things are, how exactly you need
    to create this merge request to get your S3 bucket, and this is how you learned.
    Right?
  sec: 1774
  time: '29:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: More or less, yes. But also to maybe make the process easier. If I would start
    again learning the same stuff, I would definitely narrow the scope. Because if
    you're asking some DevOps engineer, “Okay, I want to be more into operational
    stuff. What should I learn?” “Linux, then some cloud provider, Docker, Kubernetes
    and yada yada yada.” I would reply “Okay. So after five years, I will maybe become
    useful, finally.” [Alexey chuckles]
  sec: 1804
  time: '30:04'
  who: Tomasz
- line: This is kind of a misunderstanding, because if you are working in the database,
    AWS has what –probably like 200+ different services? Scan the list and then answer
    yourself if you will be spawning some fleet of IoT robots? I have doubts. If you
    will be working on quantum computing? I have doubts. If you will be working on
    ground stations? Probably not. After that pre-filtering, you will come to the
    conclusion that “Okay, I actually need the IAM roles, EC2 machines, S3 buckets,
    Kinesis maybe, EMR.” So out of 200 services, you will end up with “Okay, I actually
    need 20 of them.” That narrows the scope a bit. A good example of the possible
    roadmap could be the roadmap.sh/DevOps, probably. It's also pretty accurate for
    the data domain. But I would say “Good enough is quite okay.”
  sec: 1804
  time: '30:04'
  who: Tomasz
- line: You don't have to spend like five years in some kind of basement constantly
    training and learning, and then finally you will become the “useful” guy. Not
    necessarily. Every single team like security, SREs, platform team, and whoever,
    has a list of their least favorite tasks. For SREs, it might be something like,
    “Okay, every single resource needs to be tagged with like, name=something, owner=something,
    the on-call guy=something. Every single resource needs to be tagged. This is the
    sort of task that nobody likes to do.” So if you are a junior in the operations
    domain, you're basically going there and asking for that kind of rookie task,
    and they will be super helpful to give you that. Alongside doing so, you will
    learn a ton and everybody will basically love you. Because you are taking the
    crappiest work possible from them and at the same time, you're actually learning.
    So it's a win-win situation.
  sec: 1804
  time: '30:04'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Take the security team, for example. They might have problems with “Folks
    are using privileged mode in the Kubernetes runners, that is like Docker. It's
    kind of not okay.” So you have to identify all such cases, go team by team and
    explain to them how Kaniko works. It's also a completely rookie task. You will
    learn a ton while doing so and you will know the people you will be working with
    better. Again, it's a win-win situation. So establish the connections. Make people
    from the technical teams know about you. Plus, teach others, obviously. Also –
    start simple. You don't have to start from administrating the Kubernetes cluster.
    You can just do the Docker image on your laptop, then push it to some registry,
    then push it to a different registry.

    some security scanning. Then create that on the CI pipeline instead of your laptop.
    So those steps and blah, blah, blah. Out of making some little steps, you will
    finally go to the more or less end of the path into that particular task. One
    last piece of advice on the learning process – accept that it will be uncomfortable.
  sec: 1804
  time: '30:04'
  who: Tomasz
- line: If you are from the data domain, you are probably closer to the PhD in stats
    than to the Linux admin. So now, out of being a senior data scientist or a super-powerful
    machine learning engineer or whoever, you are going to some very different domain.
    So it will be like forcing a weightlifter to do cardio training. It's a different
    speciality, so it will be uncomfortable and it doesn't mean that you are unqualified,
    or the worst case, stupid or whatever. It’s just a different domain. It will be
    tough. You've got some folks out there to support you.

- line: Speaking of that – right now we have a machine learning engineering course
    and we are currently covering the deployment module. So far, for many students
    (we're on week five right now) it was fine, because it was a Jupyter Notebook.
    But now, all of a sudden, from this convenient, comfortable environment of a Jupyter
    Notebook, we end up doing things in the terminal. And I have a question for you
    – I think you mentioned that you studied econometrics, right? Then you worked
    as a data scientist. I guess this Linux admin stuff wasn't something life prepared
    you to do. [chuckles] So how did you learn this thing? How did it become comfortable
    for you to work in this environment?

- line: Honestly, by making every possible mistake that could be made. I know this
    might sound stupid, but that's how it was. But what may help you feel more comfortable
    with the command line is to do the proper setup. If you look at the terminals
    of some service or something, they will have plenty of [audio cuts out] and that
    sort of jazz and that's for a good reason. It probably doesn't have auto completion,
    syntax highlighting…

    Just to make sure we would get it – you said talk to SRE who already has proper
    setup in the terminal and then I lost it.
  sec: 2252
  time: '37:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: And ask them basically what they have installed and what for. Because, honestly,
    terminal without auto-completion, without syntax highlighting, without proper
    bash RC – it's not a comfy place. With the proper bash RC setup, it will be much
    more friendly – you will immediately see the possible mistakes. commands will
    autocomplete. It will just be better.
  sec: 2267
  time: '37:47'
  who: Tomasz

    information?
  sec: 2300

    Medium, whatever. But it may happen that someone on YouTube already created a
    full-blown video about how to configure let's say Data Sage or anything about
    that. So basically type “command line tutorial course setup” whatever, and I bet
    you 50 bucks that there will be something in the first 10 results.
  sec: 2324
  time: '38:44'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Yeah, I think I saw a couple of videos like that – that are one hour long
    and some of them are even longer – that show you how to set up your environment
    from nothing, from a clean Windows/Mac OS/Linux, whatever you use. I saw a video
    with Windows. One year ago I switched from Ubuntu to Windows and I needed to prepare
    the environment for that. Of course, for me, everything was alien. I found the
    tutorial that just walked me through the entire thing of how I should set up a
    terminal. At the end it was like a usual Linux setup with just that single video.
    I unfortunately don't remember that video. But it wasn't difficult to find. I
    think it was one of the top results.
  sec: 2366

    created something for exactly your case, like “How to set up a Kubernetes cluster
    from scratch,” or “full course about how to prepare for AWS Solutions Architect

  time: '40:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Between DataOps and data engineering? ML data engineer will be more operational,
    meaning he or she will be actually doing some pipelines, preparing some quality
    checks or whatever. A DataOps will honestly, gee… If I remember correctly my statistics
    from Google calendar when I was working as a DataOps in OLX, it was like 25 hours
    average per week on Zoom calls. So a data engineer will probably spend more time
    in PyCharm and DataOps will spend more time on Slack, Zoom, and email.
  sec: 2459

    I guess?
  sec: 2505
  time: '41:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Most often, honestly, live coding, designing some solutions. If you
    think about which domains DataOps touches, it's essentially past – meaning absorbing
    the technical debt. The present – meaning handling the users’ requests, like daily
    problems. And you're also thinking about the future –maybe you just prepare the
    summary of how the past month went, like “Okay. Most people have had problems
    with some service roles for the GitHub runners, because they have to go to 12
    different repositories.” So now you're talking with the SREs “Guys, we might want
    to simplify that. Because there is, yet again, a problem with this process being
    too complicated. So maybe we should do something about this.”
  sec: 2512
  time: '41:52'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Also, you're educating people. Imagine you've got newcomers to the company
    – someone has been onboarded by HR, but HR can only onboard you on what the teams
    are, what the structures are, who your boss will be, where you can ask for this
    or that. But the technical onboarding will probably be on the shoulders of DataOps.
    It's also your job to catch the newcomers to the company and make them comfortable.
    I don't know if that answers the question.
  sec: 2512
  time: '41:52'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Maybe I'll try to summarize. Data engineers actually work in the PyCharm,
    VS Code, and so on. But DataOps mostly use Zoom and Slack and other things. [chuckles]
    That was the summary from my point of view. But I guess there is more to that.
    There is mostly support, also, at least with SREs that I see – my colleagues always
    have something open, like some sort of dashboard or something like Grafana or
    New Relic. So not only do they help people who come with ad hoc requests, but
    also they see “Okay, yeah, something is off here. Let me take a look at what’s
    inside.”

    live coding, supporting, and education. From what I understood, this means that
    you already need to be a quite experienced person to work as a DataOps. Do you
    need to be a data engineer in the past to be successful in this role? What kind
    of background is actually useful for this role? Or not “useful” but maybe suitable?

  sec: 2698
  time: '44:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Any. Whether you were an analyst, data engineer, data scientist, whoever it
    will be useful. Why? Because you don't have to be an expert. You will be serving
    as a middleman between, let’s say, the platform team, the security team, the SRE
    team, and the users, meaning data analysts, engineers, scientists. The majority
    of the cases are literally not that hard. It’s more than enough to be able to
    read the log and try to figure out what is actually happening. You were working
    previously as a Java developer, if I remember correctly, so you definitely know
    how verbose the error messages and the logs are.

  who: Tomasz

  who: Alexey
- line: Which basically means that if you're able to help people understand the logs,
    if you can help them understand how the cross-account roles will work in AWS –
    it's more than enough. You don't have to be a super expert, meaning, if you all
    of a sudden need to set up DNS records here and there, there will be some SRE
    who will be super glad that you're asking him or her about the technical questions,
    because SREs like technical questions. They’re typically not super thrilled to
    explain to someone over and over again how AssumeRole works. They are more thrilled
    about some really complex issue in the Kubernetes cluster that keeps them up and
    running. And you're taking that, let's say “unpleasant” or less favorite part
    from them, leaving them with the more technical side, which is, again, a win-win
    for both sides.
  sec: 2760

    and there was actually a comment. You said there are 200 (or even more) services
    in AWS and you don't need to use all of them. Somebody commented that this is
    the Pareto principle applied to AWS services. But still, apart from the services
    that you mentioned, like IAM role, EC2, Ss3, EMR, we also have Docker, we also
    have Kubernetes. We also have CI/CD tools, we also have Prometheus, Grafana.
  sec: 2875
  time: '47:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I haven't even started mentioning data-specific tools. These are all like
    general software engineering tools – general SRE/DevOps tools. So how do you actually
    start learning that? Do you have any suggestions? What are the minimal operational
    skills that I need to have in order to be able to work in this role?
  sec: 2875
  time: '47:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: They have to be minimal. It has to be a really narrow set. A little bit of
    context. Some time ago, I read an excellent article. I believe it was called Good
    Enough Practices in Scientific Computing, or something like that. Someone went
    through all the best practices, they advised the best practices, or the best set
    of tools to someone, and then after some weeks checked if, in fact, that list
    and that training actually changed anything. The answer was – only partially.
    Because if you introduce someone to all the best-in-class, it might be complicated.
    If someone has never worked with any version control system, let's start with
    Dropbox. Honestly.
  sec: 2938
  time: '48:58'
  who: Tomasz
- line: If you are still keeping passwords in some passwords.txt – password manager,
    please. YubiKey maybe. But start with a password manager honestly. Command line
    – if you set up the command line properly, then it will make your work and your
    life, basically, so much easier. And then if you will be working some DataOps,
    DevOps, SRE, whoever, he or she will also be super happy because they will not
    spend time trying to figure out what you have done in your command line. They
    will recognize the common stuff that they already know, meaning that you are somewhat
    experienced already, which will make it easier for them to diagnose the real problems
    here and there.
  sec: 2938
  time: '48:58'
  who: Tomasz
- line: So I would say the minimal operation skills for everybody, whether this will
    be DataOps, or just a data analyst or whoever – version control system (probably
    Git), command line – to some extent, it will be enough to just know how to move
    between directories, how to grab something, how to cut something, how to assume
    the role in the Adobe CLI. Pretty much it. Plus password manager. Plus, as I said,
    IAM roles, which essentially means IAM. Why I'm stressing the IAM part over and
    over again, because honestly 90% of the errors are about “access denied”. Being
    able to run AWS STS get-caller-identity to know which role I'm currently in is
    super powerful – and super simple at the same time. Just drawing the different
    like, “Okay, this role can be assumed from that role. And that role can be from
    that role.” Just writing that down on some piece of paper, creating some dots

- header: Similarities between DataOps and Data Science Managers
- line: While you were away, I was trying to keep people on the call entertained.
    One Adonis mentioned is that what we talked about largely sounded like a data
    management role – all these Zoom calls, all this support in Slack, all this trying
    to live code with somebody – from what I see managers also often do it, especially
    with somebody who's, let's say, less senior. They often do it with juniors, with
    maybe middle-level people, all this kind of work. So what is the difference between
    a DataOps person and a data manager person – somebody who is mentoring people?
  sec: 3277
  time: '54:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: That will be quite simple to explain, because usually data managers have their
    own team – a fixed set of like five or six or ten or whatever – of some folks.
    And as DataOps, you are working across different teams, across different business
    units. You are observing some Slack channel, like “data support_something” and
    that will be pretty much for everybody. You will definitely have some splits if
    you are not the only one doing DataOps in the company. Someone will take the requests
    from one business unit and someone will take them from other business units. But
    essentially you will be working with a larger number of people, not only the fixed
    set of five or six. A data manager will also do one-on-ones, promotion plans,
    plan some sprints, and stuff like that. Whereas DataOps works with multiple different
    teams – but also with data managers, definitely yes.
  sec: 3322
  time: '55:22'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Also maybe data managers – at least a typical data manager – might not have
    kubectl installed, they might not have Kubernetes access configured. They might
    not be able to actually log into the Kubernetes cluster and check what logs are
    there and what could be happening there. But a DataOps person will probably have
    these things, right?
  sec: 3404
  time: '56:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Probably, yes. But also, fun fact, Kubernetes is not that present in the data
    domain. If you are in the software engineering side, and you are a DevOps, not
    DataOps, definitely Kubernetes will be your bread and butter – every single thing
    will be on that platform, let's say, because what are you doing, essentially?
    Some frontend APIs, which is what Kubernetes is suited for. If you're in the data
    domain, you'll get a ton of batch jobs, which is not necessarily the first use
    case for Kubernetes. It will be most probably something like ECS, AWS batch, or
    GitLab, Jenkins – that sort of stuff.
  sec: 3432
  time: '57:12'
  who: Tomasz

    right? Sometimes there are some services that we can use from AWS or other cloud
    providers that [cross-talk]
  sec: 3485

    interesting project and why?”
  sec: 3506
  time: '58:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, the one I spent the most time on – was migrating a lot of workloads
    (almost 600) from all Jenkins servers to GitLab CI. It wasn't the most interesting
    because of the migration – because migrations are, honestly, pretty boring. What
    was interesting was working with pretty much the whole company at the same time
    on one project. Everybody and their mothers had some ETL job somewhere on some
    Jenkins instance. So that was the fun part, working with pretty much everybody.
    Maybe not the most interesting, but funny, was with debugging, actually. SREs
    plus contractors plus whoever were trying to move some Kinesis readers from an
    old EC2 machine to Kubernetes. Stream processing is a perfect use case for Kubernetes.
    Okay, fine.
  sec: 3518
  time: '58:38'
  who: Tomasz
- line: I guess the count of people who were into that debugging process finally reached
    like nine or ten – super experienced guys, honestly. They just said “Okay, it's
    Dockerized. We got the Helm chart. Everything is set. Service accounts are properly
    done and deployed and yada, yada, yada.” Yet, the application just starts and
    immediately dies – out of nowhere. Then I joined that effort and one of the first
    questions I asked was like, “Hey, guys. Do we actually know that the library versions
    on that EC2 machine inside that container are actually the same as the ones we
    have there?” Someone was like, “Okay, you are a junior in the operation space.
    You probably don't know how Docker actually works, yada, yada, yada.” I was like,
    “Okay, maybe I don't.” But then we scanned how the Docker file was actually created.
    It was fetching the requirements.txt and the versions weren't specified there.
    So all of the sudden, when we just packed the library version, the problematic
    one was Psychopg – the PostgreS driver. The whole fix was like four characters.
    It took a quarter.
  sec: 3518
  time: '58:38'
  who: Tomasz
- line: Psychopg relies on a binary… There is some binary code in Python, where you
    don't see any stack traces, it just dies and kills the entire container. Right?
    Sounds like fun.
  sec: 3687
  time: '1:01:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: The code was prepared to work with version 2.7-something – without the version
    being specified, when folks try to run that stuff on Kubernetes, it fetched the
    latest version. And the API changed. This is the perfect use case. I tell everybody
    when they ask questions like “Why do we have to use fixed versions? Why can’t
    we just use any version, like the latest?” That's exactly why.

- line: Okay. Last question for today. At the beginning, you told us a story when
    you worked in analytics and somebody from management asked you how confident you
    were in the results. So how do you usually answer this question?
  sec: 3748
  time: '1:02:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: That “I'm as comfy as we get money to check all the edge cases.” Because the
    same manager who asked me that question was the same, one that healed me totally
    from checking every single possible edge case and error. If you are working in
    basic research, (basic is the name, but it implies that it might be simple – it's
    not. It's fundamental research in academia) then you basically are receiving the
    CSV file and that's it. If you are working in a company, data is flowing constantly.
    So tracking changes, policy changes, whatever changes, pipeline changes, schema
    changes, like everything changes constantly and failure is the only constant.
    As Werner Vogels said “Everything fails all the time.” Vogels is currently the
    CTO of AWS, so he probably knows what he was talking about.
  sec: 3770

  who: Tomasz

    errors, like “Before presenting the results, maybe let's check if all the things
    are set properly.” While I was doing that, my manager came in and asked, “Okay,
    are you done?” “Almost. I still get some edge cases in 10,000 records.” And he
    asked “Out of how many?” I was Like “Eh…400 million?” [chuckles] So he was like,
    “Okay, so you were checking 10,000 records out of 400 million and you're spending
    time on that. Congratulations.” Okay, that's just… it won't be perfect – ever.
  sec: 3770
  time: '1:02:50'
  who: Tomasz
- line: But it’s definitely a wise idea to, for instance, if you are working with
    Airflow and you see that your pipelines are all green and so on. What does it
    actually mean? That the records were inserted into the given table or that the
    network didn't fail as it did for me today. The answer might be sometimes surprising.
    Okay, zero records inserted. Jobs are still green. So that kind of stuff might
    be checked before presenting some extraordinary results to leadership. Extraordinary
    claims require extraordinary proof.
