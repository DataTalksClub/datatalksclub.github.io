short: From Software Engineer to Data Science Manager
title: From Software Engineer to Data Science Manager
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about changing careers from software engineering to
    data science management. We have a special guest today, Sadat. Sadat and I are
    colleagues – we both work at OLX Group. He joined OLX as a software engineer,
    and then he got promoted to an engineering manager. And finally he decided to
    change his career and switch to data science management. I invited Sadat to talk
    more about his career transitioning. Welcome.
  sec: 65
  time: '1:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you very much. Super happy to be here and talk to the community.
  sec: 92
  time: '1:32'
  who: Sadat
- header: Sadat’s background
- line: Happy to have you here, too. Before we go into our main topic and discuss
    your career transitioning in detail, maybe we can briefly go over your career
    journey so far. So how did it start?
  sec: 97
  time: '1:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. Here's a fun fact that I think not a lot of people know, but I actually
    always wanted to become a doctor – an inspiration that I had from my father. Engineering,
    or maybe data science management, was really something that became a reality much
    later on in this journey. In adolescence, teenage years, is when I realized that
    I'm super curious about technology. Those things fascinated me. It turns out engineering
    was then a better option.
  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Sadat
- line: I have a Bachelor's in electronics and I have a Master’s in informatics (information
    technology) from a university in Germany, in Stuttgart. In between my Bachelor's
    and Master’s, I worked for a brief period in India, around two and a half, three
    years. To be honest, not the best part of my career. I wasn't doing something
    crazy. But I think my Master’s changed a lot of that.
  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Sadat
- line: During my Master’s, while I was a student, I was also working for the Fraunhofer
    Institute, which is a very famous German Research Institute, as a hivi (I'm not
    really sure what it's called in English). It’s a student job and you work on different
    projects with people writing their PhDs or full time employees of the Fraunhofer
    Institute.
  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Sadat
- line: Research assistant, I guess?
  sec: 190
  time: '3:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Research assistant? Yeah, probably. I think it's called “hilsveitshaft” or
    something in German, “hivi” short, but yeah, I think a research assistant works.
    This was fun. That's where I got my proper exposure to software engineering and
    also maybe my first introduction to computer vision. There was a brief project
    that I did with insurance companies, where the idea was to look at the image of
    a car and identify dents in it. OpenCV – good old days.
  sec: 192
  time: '3:12'
  who: Sadat
- line: After I finished my Master’s, I moved to Berlin. Ever since I've been here,
    OLX is now my fourth company in Berlin. I started at ReBuy, Delivery Hero – there
    was a brief stint at Daimler, the company that owned Mercedes Benz – and now OLX.
  sec: 192
  time: '3:12'
  who: Sadat
- line: For how long have you been with OLX?
  sec: 244
  time: '4:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's almost three years now. In February, I'm going to be finishing my third
    year at OLX and starting my fourth.
  sec: 248
  time: '4:08'
  who: Sadat
- line: What did you actually study for your Bachelor’s? You said electronics, but
    I have no idea what it actually means.
  sec: 254
  time: '4:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Neither do I, to be honest. [chuckles] It’s been a long time.
  sec: 261
  time: '4:21'
  who: Sadat
- line: Did you learn to solder or what? [chuckles]
  sec: 263
  time: '4:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Right. It was a Bachelor''s – it was an engineering degree in electronics,
    so I had a lot of signal processing. Hardware, really, that was the focus: semiconductor
    compositions, PCB design, stuff like that. Not a lot of computer science. Actually,
    I had two courses related to computer science in my Bachelor''s.'
  sec: 265
  time: '4:25'
  who: Sadat
- line: But you learned to program there.
  sec: 287
  time: '4:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. Like I said, that was during my Master’s. I guess I probably learned to
    program during my Master’s. I always had this curiosity. After my Bachelor's,
    I worked for two and a half years in India. During this period, I tried to learn
    programming, but I wasn't very good at it. Also, my job was called a software
    engineer, but I wasn't engineering any software in those days.
  sec: 289
  time: '4:49'
  who: Sadat
- line: '[chuckles] What did you do?'
  sec: 321
  time: '5:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was a glorified accountant, I would say. I learned a lot of Excel tricks.
    I know a lot of Excel shortcuts that most engineers probably don't.
  sec: 322
  time: '5:22'
  who: Sadat
- line: Can you do a pivot table?
  sec: 333
  time: '5:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can do a pivot table, I can do V lookups, I can do edge lookups. [chuckles]
    I haven’t used them for a while.
  sec: 336
  time: '5:36'
  who: Sadat
- line: So that's how you started data science, right?
  sec: 341
  time: '5:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's how. A lot of those things actually do… That's the thing, I think it's
    interesting. No matter what you do, it might not seem interesting, but if you're
    learning something, anything – keep at it. You don't know when it'll become handy.
    Some of the stuff that I learned back in those days with Excel, I do use today,
    as a manager. I work a lot with Excel now.
  sec: 344
  time: '5:44'
  who: Sadat
- line: Do you work with something else as a manager? [chuckles]
  sec: 366
  time: '6:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Documentation. I think that would be one. So the Google G Suite – that is
    my new IDE that I have. I've started noticing that I’m more often on that than
    I am on an IDE.
  sec: 370
  time: '6:10'
  who: Sadat
- header: Sadat’s backend engineering experience
- line: Okay, let's go back three years. So what did it do at OLX as a back end engineer?
  sec: 383
  time: '6:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: I started OLX as a senior engineer for the search team. When I was hired at
    OLX, I was already in the field of search (search and recommendation) for a while
    now – around three, four years, I guess. So I started at OLX as a search engineer.
    My first tasks, if I remember correctly – the day I joined OLX, my manager met
    me in the kitchen (in the lobby) and he said, “We are having an issue on Solr
    right now. Welcome, but I'm gonna come back for you later.”
  sec: 391
  time: '6:31'
  who: Sadat
- line: This was my introduction. I landed on this ship and there was already a fire.
    Solr, as a lot of people who’ve used it, can maybe understand that sometimes you
    have a setup that isn't optimal and it's always screaming and shouting and burning.
  sec: 391
  time: '6:31'
  who: Sadat
- line: What is Solr? For those who don't know?
  sec: 439
  time: '7:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right, sorry. For those of you who don't know, Solr is basically an inverted
    index document store that is powered on this library called Lucene, which is the
    same library that powers Elasticsearch. So if you haven't heard of Solr, but you
    know what Elasticsearch is, it's basically Lucene wrapped under a different kind
    of image. Very similar stuff.
  sec: 441
  time: '7:21'
  who: Sadat
- line: Inverted index document store means “search engine”. Right?
  sec: 470
  time: '7:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. [chuckles] Exactly. Inverted index document store. I can go into a
    lot of detail on what an inverted index is and how it works. But TLDR – it's what
    search is. It's what powers search for most companies.
  sec: 472
  time: '7:52'
  who: Sadat
- line: So you knew this before joining OLX because you already worked for a couple
    of years as a search engineer and this is something you knew how to use?
  sec: 489
  time: '8:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have worked with Solr quite a bit. I've also worked with Elasticsearch.
    I've dabbled a bit with a few other niche-er technologies in search, let's say.
    But, yeah, I'm very familiar with how these technologies work.
  sec: 499
  time: '8:19'
  who: Sadat
- line: On your first day there is a fire – Solr is down – your manager is fixing
    it. So what do you do?
  sec: 515
  time: '8:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thankfully, he didn’t ask me to fix it, because that would have been pressure,
    right? I enjoyed my coffee, met my new team, and life went on. A week later, we
    were writing the post mortem for what had happened. I don't remember the details,
    to be honest, but it was always something related to the autoscaler. Briefly,
    for those of you who worked with it, Solr is an interesting thing. Solr cloud
    is designed to scale with load and our cluster was configured to scale with load.
  sec: 522
  time: '8:42'
  who: Sadat
- line: Now, whenever a Solr cluster scales out, which is adding nodes, there is a
    lot of CPU-intensive tasks that need to be done – which is to copy the data, propagate
    it to this new node, assemble the node, distribute traffic to this new node –
    a lot of stuff that is very CPU intensive. Through that, as a system that is already
    under CPU load to do that, and you have what is the classical “fireball” of Solr
    crashing. Because Solr wants to scale out and it cannot even do what it is already
    doing – and because it cannot do what it is doing, it wants to scale out even
    more.
  sec: 522
  time: '8:42'
  who: Sadat
- line: The easiest fix is to stop that configuration (stop Solr from autoscaling
    out) which works all the time. That's what we also did eventually at OLX. Fun
    fact, our scaling is now scheduled, rather than automatic, so we do it at perceived
    intervals of time, rather than dynamically with traffic.
  sec: 522
  time: '8:42'
  who: Sadat
- line: So, let's say that during the night, it's two nodes and during the day, it’s
    four nodes or something like that?
  sec: 612
  time: '10:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Something like that, yeah. Those numbers are probably multiplied by a huge
    number.
  sec: 618
  time: '10:18'
  who: Sadat
- line: A hundred? [chuckles]
  sec: 622
  time: '10:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, somewhere around 50, maybe. But, yeah.
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Sadat
- line: Okay. Well, what did you do apart from that? I don't know how much time you
    spent fighting fires. In general, what kind of tasks did you need to work on?
  sec: 627
  time: '10:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: What had happened when I landed at the search team at OLX was that it was
    also the start of the pandemic – or almost the start of the pandemic. We didn't
    know that yet. There was this new virus news coming in from China – a lot of uncertainty.
    We were putting out a lot of fires. There was some product roadmap, I don't exactly
    remember what, but two weeks into my job at OLX, we entered the German lockdowns.
    I think other countries had rolling lockdowns around that time. But Germany had
    locked down two weeks after I joined and there was a lot of uncertainty. There
    was a focus from management to really work on only essential stuff and things
    that will keep the business alive, because back then we didn't know how long this
    would last, what the financial implications would be and stuff like that. Basically,
    a lot of our moonshot projects were put on hold.
  sec: 637
  time: '10:37'
  who: Sadat
- line: I had the time I needed to look at the landscape and understand what our main
    problems were. What I had identified as one of our main problems was the fact
    that we were still very much coupled to the big monolith. This posed some challenges
    plus the configurations with our Solr cluster were suboptimal. I created a proposal,
    shared that with my manager and my product manager – to decouple search. It was
    an interesting idea. My ask to them was “Give me six months with zero product
    feature development, but core engineering work, and I will promise to give you
    the fastest iterating product at OLX.” Three years later, I think, the relevance
    team, which is now my feature team, is one of the fastest iterating teams at OLX.
    Last year, I think we did over 100 experiments with new product features.
  sec: 637
  time: '10:37'
  who: Sadat
- line: My management, my leaders, believed in me, they gave me the opportunity, and
    humbly I think I achieved a lot of what I had promised. There were some delays
    – I think it took us a little more than six months. But we eventually got there.
    We decoupled search, we improved the configurations, and we also have backups
    upon backups now. So I guess the last time we had a full outage on search – it's
    probably been over a year or two years.
  sec: 637
  time: '10:37'
  who: Sadat
- header: Sadat’s pivot point as a backend engineer
- line: Maybe I'll try to summarize what you said. You and your team had a super large
    service that was doing everything, including search. Search was a little piece
    of this. Making changes to this little piece was very difficult because it affected
    the rest of the service. You approached your management and suggested, “Give me
    six months, I'll take this part out into a separate service and it will be a micro
    service. We'll be responsible only for search.”
  sec: 787
  time: '13:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Macro service is what I like to use. Macro is a little more than micro. I
    mean, it is a very broad service – it does a lot of stuff. But in essence, yes.
    We wanted to carve out a bit of the Big OLX Monolith. This helped us with a lot
    of stuff. The stack was newer – alerting and monitoring were thought of before
    the product development, so it was very natural to have alerting and monitoring
    in place. We had a lot of experience running the old system, so we knew what systems
    needed to be optimized or what parts of the code needed to be optimized, what
    parts of the code could be rewritten in different ways. In essence, that's what
    we did.
  sec: 820
  time: '13:40'
  who: Sadat
- line: What did you use for that? For implementing this thing?
  sec: 866
  time: '14:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'The new service, the service that is currently live, was written in Kotlin.
    There are a few other satellites around the macro service, which are written in
    Python and Kotlin, depending on what the services are. Search at OLX also consumes
    a lot of machine learning products: spellchecker, RANCOR – all of that. So we
    do have some Python services that are in the ecosystem. But the main chunk is
    Kotlin.'
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Sadat
- header: Sadat’s exposure to ML and Data Science
- line: What was your exposure to all this machine learning and data science? I guess
    before OLX, or at OLX, how much of this stuff did you already know?
  sec: 903
  time: '15:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: My first exposure to machine learning, artificial intelligence, was during
    my Master’s thesis. The thesis that I published was basically to propose an algorithm
    that was using a neural network to predict the energy consumptions at the Stuttgart
    Airport. It was in collaboration with a company that is responsible for maintaining
    and running the Stuttgart airport. That was my first exposure – that's when I
    really got into the details of what neural networks were and how they functioned.
    I built my first network then. Transfer learning was definitely not a thing back
    in the day, so I created my own network, played around with deep nets, shallow
    nets – all of that stuff – but only for the purposes of time series forecasting.
  sec: 913
  time: '15:13'
  who: Sadat
- line: So that was my first exposure. Then I was doing search at reBuy. This is my
    first company in Berlin. A couple of years into my job… reBuy is an amazing company,
    by the way. A plug to them, not that they need it – they offer engineers 20% of
    the week to work on pet projects. The only condition is that these pet projects
    should not be completely ludicrous. If you were to propose you want to learn knitting,
    they might say no. But for any tech-related projects, they're super game. A colleague
    of mine, Machu, (love the guy, by the way) I don't know where he's based these
    days, to be honest but he's still at ReBuy. Not in Berlin anymore. Machu and I
    decided to work on spellchecker, because that was a problem that we were facing
    at search/product at reBuy.
  sec: 913
  time: '15:13'
  who: Sadat
- line: We wanted to use the 20% time to try and implement a deep learning spellchecker.
    Long story short, we did not succeed, but we learned a lot more about machine
    learning and about training algorithms. That also actually kickstarted the inspiration
    to then start the Search Tech Community in Berlin, which is a community where
    we host meetups – shameless plug to that as well. [chuckles] I hope it's not uncommon
    for people to plug things and the various activities that they're associated with.
  sec: 913
  time: '15:13'
  who: Sadat
- line: Definitely not. That’s why people come to the podcast, I guess. [laughs] So
    you started this meetup (this community) while at reBuy? It was a while ago, right?
  sec: 1057
  time: '17:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was a while ago, yes. I think the community is over four years old now.
    No, it's five, six years old. It's an old community. We actually went on a sabbatical
    during most of the corona pandemic – for two years. That's why it feels much shorter
    than it actually is. It’s like two years of my life I've been erased. I forget
    to factor that in. So that's when the community started. It got me connected to
    a lot of other people working on search, working on recommendations, because usually,
    ranking is a very common factor in both of these things.
  sec: 1067
  time: '17:47'
  who: Sadat
- line: Then somewhere during this time, in this community, both Machu and I were
    inspired to give up the spell checker and pick up recommendations as a project
    – as a problem that we wanted to solve. We trained a few algorithms. In the end,
    word2vec was very popular in those days. A lot of teams were doing it. I think
    what inspired us was probably Pinterest pin2vec – there's a lot of these “2vecs”
    out there. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1067
  time: '17:47'
  who: Sadat
- line: Did you actually find a paper? Or was it more like a video?
  sec: 1135
  time: '18:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. We actually tried, to be honest. Machu I think is more disciplined than
    I am in this. We did find a few official papers on the word2vec architecture.
    But then, I think in the end, it was videos. For me, it was mainly going through
    videos and actually hacking code. I gave up reading and just started doing stuff.
    I remember the word2vec model because that's the one that succeeded in the end.
    A year from there, I think what ended up happening was that the search team became
    the “search and recommendation” team. Before this, reBuy was buying recommendations
    from a SaaS provider and our model was actually better. We did some A/B tests
    and we were 2-3% better in transactions from recommendations, compared to our
    competition. I think we ended up saving half a million euros or something like
    that for the company, with a model that we had trained in the 20% of our time.
  sec: 1138
  time: '18:58'
  who: Sadat
- line: That was when I was very much involved. The recommendation project was something
    where we worked on the training, the data engineering, the data gathering – and
    all of the nitty gritties of probably what most data scientists do today, all
    the way up to taking the model to production, hosting it on our AWS account, and
    then having a job that would retrain it. I had very little professional experience
    in machine learning back then. Now that I've worked with some amazing practitioners
    and machine learning engineers, I laugh at what I had pushed to production. But
    it was not very different from what the experts are doing today.
  sec: 1138
  time: '18:58'
  who: Sadat
- line: Just curious, how much of the theory did you already know and how much did
    you need to know to actually do all of that? Or was it completely hacking?
  sec: 1237
  time: '20:37'
  who: Alexey
- header: Sadat’s Act Before you Think approach (with safety nets)
- line: It was a lot of… the internet. I love the internet. You don't need to know
    anything. You just copy/paste and brute force till it works. That's one way that
    I work. And it does work. To be honest, I understood the word2vec model after
    I had implemented my model. I mean, I conceptually understood why it works and
    what it does after I saw it work for the recommendations. Before that, for me,
    it was just, “Yeah, something that works. There are a bunch of companies that
    are using it. Recommendations is one use case. Let's see what we can do.”
  sec: 1247
  time: '20:47'
  who: Sadat
- line: I think that’s pretty typical for engineers. This is how I learned this thing,
    too. Just try it and see what happens.
  sec: 1281
  time: '21:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: “Act before you think.” [Alexey agrees] It's not good advice, but for engineering
    (and if nobody's life depends upon it) it's not bad advice.
  sec: 1291
  time: '21:31'
  who: Sadat
- line: What can possibly go wrong if you're just on your laptop? It’s one thing if
    it's in a production system and the entire search service goes down. But if it's
    just your laptop, and you’re checking if this thing is working or not, then it's
    another thing. Right?
  sec: 1300
  time: '21:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. One thing that I've always told colleagues and also engineers
    who’ve worked with me is “Invest in safety nets, because once you have a strong
    safety net, you're not going to be afraid to try stuff. Feature flags, experimentation,
    backups, alerts, monitoring, etc. If you have a robust system that is designed
    in a way that failure is not, “if” but “when”. So it's never a question of if
    you'd fail, it's a question of when you will fail. Prepare for that. If you have
    that done, you can be very bold and make maverick decisions. That's how you're
    going to succeed. Because to be honest, it's a very fast-paced world we live in.
    We can't be cautious all the time.
  sec: 1318
  time: '21:58'
  who: Sadat
- line: In summary, just pick a project that might benefit from machine learning,
    implement it, make sure there are safety nets – if anything goes wrong, there
    is a switch that you can just take it down or just turn it off. That's basically
    it. Right?
  sec: 1366
  time: '22:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's your playground. Once you've got your playground setup – play. That's
    the only way you will learn to be good at the game. You have to practice. Another
    thing I tell myself is “I'm not a heart surgeon. Nobody's going to die.” [chuckles]
  sec: 1383
  time: '23:03'
  who: Sadat
- line: Well, maybe there is a user who really wants to find a particular pair of
    shoes and they can't because the search is down.
  sec: 1399
  time: '23:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's a few euros or dollars lost. It's okay. But again, we should be bold.
    Don't be afraid of making mistakes. You learn more from your mistakes than you
    will from otherwise.
  sec: 1405
  time: '23:25'
  who: Sadat
- header: Sadat’s street cred and transition into management
- line: Okay. Coming back to your OLX days – you saw that there was a problem and
    you wanted to solve it. You were new then, right? You just joined. You came to
    the management and said, “Okay, give me six months. I'll make some magic and then
    it will work really fast.”
  sec: 1419
  time: '23:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: I did not promise magic. [chuckles] I had an architecture diagram that I had
    proposed. [Alexey agrees] To be honest, it may sound cooler than it is. Like I
    said, before OLX, I had done search at Delivery Hero. And before that I had done
    search at reBuy. Unsurprisingly… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1436
  time: '23:56'
  who: Sadat
- line: So you had some street cred, right?
  sec: 1455
  time: '24:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not only did I have street cred, I had done the exact same thing in those
    two jobs. That's how the industry evolves.
  sec: 1458
  time: '24:18'
  who: Sadat
- line: That's why you were hired, right?
  sec: 1467
  time: '24:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: I guess. When companies are hiring, when we are hiring, when I am hiring –
    if you have prior experience with what I'm planning on doing, you obviously have
    a better chance. I was invited to the interview because of the meetup that I would
    host. People who had invited me and knew me from before my interviews – it helps
    to be present in the community and to, like you said, have street credit. It definitely
    does help.
  sec: 1469
  time: '24:29'
  who: Sadat
- line: So management trusted you with working on that thing. You spent half a year,
    it worked, and then you got promoted to an engineering manager. Was it like that?
  sec: 1501
  time: '25:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. No, it wasn't like that. [both laugh] But this definitely was a very strong
    point in making it happen when it happened. After we had scaled out, six or seven
    months later, we were also more certain about how the world was evolving. At this
    point, six months into the pandemic, online businesses were thriving. There was
    a lot of business happening, money was flowing in, and so companies started to
    reinvest in themselves.
  sec: 1511
  time: '25:11'
  who: Sadat
- line: The search team was growing. There was a little bit of a reorg and it became
    the “relevance team” as it is now in its current incarnation. The idea was to
    deliver customer value. We were doing experiment after experiment, A/B test after
    A/B test, prod features were getting launched. It definitely did add to my credit,
    that I did advocate for something that was not very obvious, but it definitely
    helped us move forward.
  sec: 1511
  time: '25:11'
  who: Sadat
- line: What was that?
  sec: 1587
  time: '26:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: The decoupling project – moving out of search. To be honest, the way I became
    an EM was that my existing EM decided to leave the company. That created the opportunity.
    You need to have the capability, but you also need the opportunity – and you need
    luck to have them both. I think at this time, I had that around. My manager decided
    to leave OLX. I had been at OLX at this point for a year and a half or so – actually
    a little more than a year. And then things started falling in place.
  sec: 1588
  time: '26:28'
  who: Sadat
- line: I interviewed. The way we do it at OLX is, if an IC wants to move. I think
    after a senior engineer, especially a senior engineer moving into an engineering
    manager's position, it's a serious recruitment process. I went through the entire
    process, including the technical screening – the recruiter screen, which, in my
    opinion, seemed a little superfluous, but… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1588
  time: '26:28'
  who: Sadat
- header: The hiring process as an internal candidate
- line: It was as if they were hiring somebody external – completely, the entire process.
  sec: 1660
  time: '27:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was completely as if I was applying for the first time. Well, I think,
    that's also the intention. OLX wants to treat you as an external hire because
    at the end of the day, we want the best person for the job. There are certain
    benefits to being an internal candidate. You can showcase what you've done in
    the past and they will believe you 100% because they see it. Whereas, if you're
    an external candidate and you say you've done something but you can't prove it,
    or your story doesn't add up – that could raise suspicion.
  sec: 1665
  time: '27:45'
  who: Sadat
- line: Also, as an internal candidate, I could ask for people I've worked with in
    the past to maybe give me a recommendation or to put in a good word. Those are
    things that maybe some external candidates might not have. But if you have good
    connections in the industry, that's also doable. So I did the interview, went
    through the entire process and only then was I offered the position of the engineering
    manager for search and recommendation.
  sec: 1665
  time: '27:45'
  who: Sadat
- line: Do you remember the questions?
  sec: 1727
  time: '28:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: It wasn't related to search, if you're asking that. [chuckles]
  sec: 1731
  time: '28:51'
  who: Sadat
- line: What was it related to?
  sec: 1735
  time: '28:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: A lot of my interview was related to people management. Maybe a little anecdote
    – before I applied for the EM for search and recommendations, there was another
    internal opening at OLX in a different part of the company for an EM position,
    and I applied there as well. I was actually rejected. But after I got rejected,
    I spoke to the hiring manager, because we're all OLX employees and he gave me
    an amazing breakdown of why I failed. What he said was “You didn't really fail,
    but you probably need a little more to pass the bar.”
  sec: 1737
  time: '28:57'
  who: Sadat
- line: That’s something that external candidates usually don't get. Right?
  sec: 1771
  time: '29:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. They won't get such detailed feedback. Usually, if you're an external
    candidate, your feedback is delivered via the talent acquisition team. In this
    case, I was directly talking to the director of engineering who was the hiring
    manager. He gave me very good points. I thank him for that even today. Dian, if
    you're listening (he’s at Flink now, I think, with their engineering team) amazing
    feedback. I used a lot of that in the second round. And this time it was a success.
  sec: 1775
  time: '29:35'
  who: Sadat
- header: The importance of people management skills
- line: What kind of people management questions can people expect? Maybe don't give
    away the exact questions you were asked, because maybe we still use these questions.
    [chuckles] But just to get an idea. Is it about conflict resolution? Is it about
    promoting people, firing people? Or what?
  sec: 1809
  time: '30:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: To be honest, the questions aren't that important. What the hiring manager
    is trying to understand is, “Are you a person who is capable of leading the team
    that is in question?” Usually, an engineering manager or managerial positions,
    at least at OLX, are very specific to teams. That's what they're trying to understand
    – if you have a team that is riddled with conflict, they will be looking out for
    a person who is better at conflict resolution. If you are trying to lead a team
    that is very technical and developing a platform type of solution, they’d look
    for a person who's more technical than otherwise. The advantage that I had with
    my interview for the search team was that I would safely say I am well-versed
    with the field of search and recommendation. So I had that to my advantage and
    I had worked with this team before – I have been working with this team. That
    was also an advantage to me. I guess these weren't advantages in the other interview
    that I had failed.
  sec: 1825
  time: '30:25'
  who: Sadat
- line: At the end of the day, the hiring manager wants to find a person who is capable
    of leadership, rallying the team behind in tough times, celebrating with the team
    in good times and is generally somebody that the team looks up to, respects, and
    is happy to work with. From a business perspective, the engineering manager's
    job is to keep a healthy team, add business value, make sure that attrition is
    controlled – hiring new engineers is very expensive, hiring replacements even
    more so. Those are some business metrics that need to be optimized and then any
    person who can fit that profile is the person for the job.
  sec: 1825
  time: '30:25'
  who: Sadat
- line: But in terms of maybe any actionable advice? Suppose I want to interview now
    for an engineering manager position. What can I expect? How can I prove all these
    things that you said? How can I prove that I can do them?
  sec: 1931
  time: '32:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Usually, what also works is having… it's funny, like the chicken and the egg
    problem. When you're in an interview, they'll ask you for evidence that you have,
    for example, led a team in a situation or had experience in resolving conflict
    inside a team. If you're interested or you're planning to appear for such an interview,
    I would really ask you to sit back and think about the instances in your career
    where you have shown leadership – it could be a small project that you've led.
  sec: 1948
  time: '32:28'
  who: Sadat
- line: It does not need to be a group of 10 people, it could be you and a few other
    mates – a college project that you did, where you acted as a leader. So showcase
    that ability. Conflict resolution and business acumen is something that is also
    important when it comes to these positions. So you need to understand things like
    this. Look back at your career, see instances where you have shown this, and highlight
    those.
  sec: 1948
  time: '32:28'
  who: Sadat
- header: The Brag List
- line: So let’s say there was a conflict in one of the projects that I had, then
    I should take note of it, and understand what my actions were – how I helped to
    solve this conflict – and when there is a question about that, I bring this up.
    Right? That's the kind of homework I need to do?
  sec: 2011
  time: '33:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's the kind of homework. Right. Ilias, my old manager who had to leave
    OLX for me to get his position, always asked me to maintain a brag list. Maintain
    your brag list.
  sec: 2026
  time: '33:46'
  who: Sadat
- line: What is that?
  sec: 2040
  time: '34:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Whenever you do something worthy of mention, note it down – because oftentimes
    you forget that you've been an awesome person before. When it comes to such interviews,
    it's very hard to lie. The people who are interviewing are experts, so you can't
    possibly lie to someone and get away with it. The only way is to actually tell
    the truth. And in order to tell the truth, you need to remember that you've been
    in a situation like this. Generally, in a 30-minute or 45-minute interview, you
    cannot go through your entire life. So it's better to do that before – create
    your brag list and then walk into the interview with your brag list.
  sec: 2041
  time: '34:01'
  who: Sadat
- line: Did you actually have it open during the interview?
  sec: 2079
  time: '34:39'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 2082
  time: '34:42'
  who: Sadat

    reviewed it before the interview?
  sec: 2085
  time: '34:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I reviewed it before. It was a Sublime text document – very chaotic, like
    most things I do. If I had it open during the interview, I would have crashed.
  sec: 2091
  time: '34:51'
  who: Sadat
- line: Did you put it on Dropbox? How do you keep it?
  sec: 2098
  time: '34:58'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 2101
  time: '35:01'
  who: Sadat
- line: '[thumbs up][laughs] Good. Your entire brag list was there?'
  sec: 2110
  time: '35:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's still there, to be honest. If I spin it up, I have like 300 tabs in my
    Sublime text, which are basically documents that are not final enough to be saved,
    but not untidy enough to be forgotten. And the brag list is one of those documents.
  sec: 2113
  time: '35:13'
  who: Sadat
- line: Do you recommend this approach? [chuckles]
  sec: 2128
  time: '35:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I absolutely do not recommend this approach. [chuckles] What I've become
    better at now is, like I said in the beginning, I use G Suite a lot. Now I organize
    my life around Google Docs. It's one of the best tools that I have.
  sec: 2130

  who: Sadat
- line: Yeah, my favorite too. [chuckles]
  sec: 2147

    anybody.

  sec: 2157
  time: '35:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know if a lot of ICs or engineers realize this or not, but we have
    a lot of dopamine in our daily life. [cross-talk]
  sec: 2162
  time: '36:02'
  who: Sadat
- line: You mean when you code, right?
  sec: 2174
  time: '36:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: When you’re coding, right. You create a merge request – bam, that's dopamine.
    You get an approval – another shot of dopamine. You hit the merge button – dopamine.
    Deploy – dopamine. A/B test started – dopamine. There’s dopamine throughout the
    day. It is a very addictive career. And that's why people enjoy it, right? That's
    why people who are good at it get very successful at it. People spend time even
    after work. It's very interesting and especially challenging for people who are
    into it. As a manager, those dopamine shorts stop, so withdrawal is what you go
    through, really.
  sec: 2176
  time: '36:16'
  who: Sadat
- line: That is the analogy I really want to use – like a drug addict who stopped
    getting his drugs. I was very close with my previous engineering manager. We spoke
    a lot about what would happen during the transition. He prepared me for taking
    on the team. There's a lot of prep work that goes into it. Some people are lucky
    enough to have a mentor like I had. And some just figure it out. You learn how
    to ride by riding a bicycle. But nothing prepared me for what I actually felt.
    The first few weeks, when you have nothing – the thing is, the time it takes to
    see impact stretches from hours or minutes to weeks, months, maybe – a quarter
    sometimes.
  sec: 2176
  time: '36:16'
  who: Sadat
- line: Because the impact is not done by you. Right? [Sadat agrees] You need to coordinate
    this impact – you need to make it happen, but not do it yourself.
  sec: 2268
  time: '37:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: But not yourself. And that's a very key component. What a lot of early managers
    do (I think, I've done this) is when you're not getting that dopamine, you immediately
    lapse and you go back to becoming an IC – and you start coding again. Because
    there is your shot of dopamine – you feel that hit, like “Now I'm useful. I'm
    doing something again.” I made that same mistake. I went back to coding because
    that was easy for me. But then at some point, I realized that every minute that
    I am sitting with my IDE writing code is a minute that I am not doing something
    more important for my entire team – which could be talking to another stakeholder
    somewhere, getting their buy-in for a crazy project that we want to do, talking
    to a data science manager to get his team to implement a data science model.
  sec: 2277
  time: '37:57'
  who: Sadat
- line: Every minute that I was with my IDE, was a minute I was not doing those things.
    But somebody has to do those things, so they would start stacking up. And then
    you're just sitting at your computer at 8 PM writing slack messages to people
    – your day becomes crazy. You have to stop being an IC and start focusing on what
    needs to be done.
  sec: 2277
  time: '37:57'
  who: Sadat
- line: So how do you get your dopamine dose then? Chocolate? [chuckles]
  sec: 2344
  time: '39:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] I do have some chocolate bars on my desk right now, but no that''s
    not how you should be doing it. Otherwise you will put on a lot of weight. So
    one is – be prepared. No matter how prepared you think you are, understand that
    you''re not prepared. What you''re losing out is quite a bit. Trust in the people
    that you''ve talked with about this transition in the past – your mentors, other
    people from the community, from the industry – they know what they''re talking
    about. This is a longer game. I don''t play golf, but I imagine this is how golf
    would seem like. You just keep going behind the ball, shot after shot, and then
    three hours later, bam – somebody''s a winner. I don''t know how that game works.'
  sec: 2351

  who: Sadat
- line: Like chess, maybe, as well?
  sec: 2397
  time: '39:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, maybe. But in chess, the minute you take down the opponent's thing, there's
    a bit of dopamine there. [Alexey agrees] Chess can be a very-fast paced game.
    Think of the most boring game and then that is your analogies.
  sec: 2399

  sec: 2474
  time: '41:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Golf is what comes to my mind. And you need to be very strategic.
    What you need to do is, at least what worked for me, pick up a project and make
    that project your source of dopamine – or the completion of this project. And
    then drive it – put all your energy into that. A month or a quarter later, when
    you''ve delivered it…'

    work on?
  sec: 2441
  time: '40:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. By “project” I mean something that is now on your new desk. This could
    be something that you were working on in the past or not necessarily – but something
    that needs to be done for the team now. Pick that up, talk to your engineers or
    to whoever is on your team, talk to stakeholders – invest yourself in completing
    this. Focus on one project (at least that works for me) laser focus on one project
    and you will learn a lot from the mistakes that you will make during the execution
    of this project.
  sec: 2448
  time: '40:48'
  who: Sadat
- line: But when you have reached the end, and then when you get that one big shot
    of dopamine, and if you're cut out for it, because I think a lot of people just
    aren't cut out for the job. If you're cut out for it, you'll know you've made
    the right decision. And if you're not, you'll know you've made the wrong decision.
    And then you will gradually try to go back to where you were before.
  sec: 2448

  who: Sadat

    Or you have somebody?
  sec: 2505
  time: '41:45'
  who: Alexey

    needs to be done – that needs to be executed in your team, you're leading this
    team.

  who: Alexey

    your milestone should not be a quarter ahead. It should be more like a sprint
    ahead. Those can work. But I think for early on in your management career, it
    might be very hard to get all of this right. I've made my mistakes, and the people
    who are listening are going to make their own mistakes.
  sec: 2550

    time.

    was something similar? You worked as an engineering manager for some time, and
    then you applied for a data science manager position. Right?
  sec: 2592
  time: '43:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Again, I went through the interview process. The way we hire data scientists
    at OLX is very interesting. I love the process, by the way. We have a panel interview,
    which we don't have for engineering. So I had to go through the panel interview.
    I did not have to go through the recruiter screen this time. Thank you, recruiting
    team, for that. But I did go to the panel interview, I had to present my case,
    I was given a case study, and asked on how I would execute it.
  sec: 2613
  time: '43:33'
  who: Sadat
- line: I spoke with my team – my future team, the one I would be taking up and I
    spoke with the manager who was leading the team. I spoke with leaders inside data
    science. I also had a lot of anxiety. I wasn't sure. I wanted to do this – I desperately
    wanted to do the transition, because I had always been on the margins with data
    science. I had played with models, but never owned them. I deployed models but
    never really controlled them. I wanted in on the fun.
  sec: 2613
  time: '43:33'
  who: Sadat
- line: So that's why you decided to apply for a data science manager position?
  sec: 2673
  time: '44:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: The way I see my work is – there were challenges that I had as an engineering
    manager that were fun, but in data science, I feel like I'm enjoying the challenges
    more because the problems are less defined. It's a little harder to understand
    what really needs to be done. Building solutions is not as straightforward. The
    dopamine is even further delayed now, but it's even bigger chunks. For example,
    there's a topic that I have on my plate that I could maybe share. It’s regarding
    chat and moderation.
  sec: 2678
  time: '44:38'
  who: Sadat
- line: Currently, I'm leading a team of data scientists who are part of the trust
    and safety pillar at OLX. What we do there is – maybe just a little bit about
    that, before I get into some of the challenges that we face. OLX – as most of
    you viewers know by now, because you've been at this company for a while – is
    a platform which facilitates user-to-user sales. All of the content is user-generated
    and you can imagine that people are creative – they always want to game the system,
    or fool the system, or abuse the system. Our users are no different. And we have
    a very strong team of people in operations (moderators) in product engineering
    and data, that are building solutions to make sure that the content that is against
    our community policies, is not allowed to go live. This includes, for example,
    even chat messages. You can imagine people trying to abuse each other in chat,
    or scam other unsuspecting users. Preventing this is part of my team's job. But
    that is the problem.
  sec: 2678
  time: '44:38'
  who: Sadat
- line: People want to chat with each other – they are good people who want to chat
    with each other and they are bad people. Identify the bad actors, hide the messages,
    whatever – stop it from happening. This is somewhat different than the challenges
    that I had in my engineering team, which were a little more defined. Now I get
    to work with data scientists and discuss machine learning solutions, in this case,
    a lot of NLP. I need to understand the context of not just a message, but the
    entire chat, like, “What is really happening here? Is this a genuine conversation?
    Or is this somehow fraudulent? Is one person abusing the other? Are community
    guidelines being violated here?” Our idea is to develop a solution that would
    comprehensively understand what human communication is about, and then make a
    decision. Versus the engineering approach, which is “I'm going to put a filter
    for the word F-U-C-K and if somebody types it, I will block it.”

- header: How much domain knowledge is needed for management?
- line: How much do you think a data science manager should know about all these things?
    NLP is a pretty large topic. [Sadat suggests “nice”] I don't know about “niche”.
    There are a lot of things happening there. Maybe coming from a software engineering
    background, you don't necessarily know it in depth? So how much of this do you
    need to know in order to be helpful to your team? Do you even need to know that?
    Or, as a manager, you help differently – not by pointing to papers?
  sec: 2870
  time: '47:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. I don't point people to papers. They point me to papers. I think there
    are different types of manager archetypes. You will always have the manager who's
    a domain expert and is going to lead by being the domain expert. I am not a domain
    expert, neither in the topics of trust and safety, nor am I an expert in the topics
    of machine learning or data science. My focus is genuinely around coordination.
  sec: 2901
  time: '48:21'
  who: Sadat
- line: I do understand machine learning and data science to a degree where I can
    have an informed discussion with product and tell them, “Hey, this is a problem
    we can attempt to solve,” versus “This is a problem that is better solved with
    an engineering solution,” or “Better solved with a human-in-the-loop solution.”
  sec: 2901
  time: '48:21'
  who: Sadat
- line: But from then on, my job is to filter the right kind of problems, set the
    right kind of success metrics, and share that with my team. Then they take it
    from there. They propose the solutions and they propose the models. I am part
    of the discussions, because I'm genuinely curious as to how they function, how
    they propose these things, but I am not a contributor to a great deal in any of
    these discussions.
  sec: 2901
  time: '48:21'
  who: Sadat
- line: To answer the question “How much do you need to know?” I think it's definitely
    helpful to know if the problem that is being discussed will have a successful
    machine learning solution or not. That definitely helps you. But beyond that,
    it's not necessary. If you know, I think it's going to be fun, but it's not absolutely
    necessary.
  sec: 2901
  time: '48:21'
  who: Sadat
- line: Then, I guess, for mentoring the team, you rely on more senior team members?
  sec: 2988
  time: '49:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. The way structure at OLX – you, yourself, are a principal and I have
    spoken to you on occasion to help people in my team upskill with technologies.
    That's also coordination, right? I know that there are people who are better at
    this than I am. Why should I be... I just connect experts to people and that's
    it. I facilitate discussions, but I don't drive or own them.
  sec: 2994
  time: '49:54'
  who: Sadat
- header: The main difference between engineering and management
- line: How different is your job compared to what you were doing previously? Now,
    I guess you have more interaction with stakeholders and the nature of this interaction
    is slightly different, because you need to keep in mind all these things that
    you mentioned, like, “Does it need a machine learning solution? Or can we just
    go with a pure software engineering solution (i.e. filters)?” Things like that?
    Is this the main difference?
  sec: 3021
  time: '50:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think this is a significant part of the difference, yes. I am way more involved
    in product discussions than I was previously. But I also think that a part of
    this is how your company looks at the different profiles. I think at OLX, a data
    science manager is really a counterpart to product and engineering. And my job,
    the way I see it, is to work with the others from the product and technology side,
    to propose better solutions – to help them make decisions and, in the end, drive
    customer value and business value. My discussions are far less technical now and
    far more impactful than they were previously.
  sec: 3044
  time: '50:44'
  who: Sadat

    keep the EM part.
  sec: 3094
  time: '51:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Here's my honest take. Like I said, you will always have to prove yourself
    before somebody gives you the keys. How does a software engineer prove that he
    can be a good data science manager? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I think
    it’s… [cross-talk]
  sec: 3103
  time: '51:43'
  who: Sadat
- line: Well, you did a fair amount of ML-related stuff as a backend developer.
  sec: 3118
  time: '51:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Could I have done it? I think… [cross-talk]
  sec: 3124
  time: '52:04'
  who: Sadat
- line: Or were you just helping?
  sec: 3127
  time: '52:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: We'd have to ask the hiring manager if they would have taken me. [chuckles]
    What I do know is that during my interview for my current role as a data science
    manager, I did use a lot of my success stories from my previous role, which was
    an engineering manager role, to take on this position. Had those success stories
    not existed, would I have still been given the opportunity? That’s something with
    the hiring manager and the committee that interviews would answer. Like I said,
    we had a panel interview – so the panelists.
  sec: 3130
  time: '52:10'
  who: Sadat
- header: How being an EM helped Sadat transition no DS management
- line: But as an engineering manager in the search and recommendations team, you
    got involved in all these machine learning-related topics, which gave you some
    credibility, right?
  sec: 3160
  time: '52:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely. One of the benefits of being an engineering manager for the search
    and recommendations team, for me personally, was this is one team that works very
    closely with data science. The relevance team is a big contributor to the success
    of the data science work. Not only did it give me the platform, but it also allowed
    me to showcase my working style, who I am, and what I do, to my future employers.
    That definitely added value.
  sec: 3172
  time: '52:52'
  who: Sadat
- line: The future employers are here, at the same company, right?
  sec: 3203
  time: '53:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. [chuckles] The same company, different hiring manager, if you will.
  sec: 3206
  time: '53:26'
  who: Sadat
- header: Transitioning to DS management from other roles
- line: We have a few questions. One of the questions is… I don't know if you can
    answer this, but maybe you saw some of your colleagues do this. The question is,
    “What are the challenges of getting a data science managerial position from other
    roles, for example, from data engineering or analysis?” I think you were doing
    something similar to data engineering, as I understand? [Sadat agrees] We actually
    talked about that, more or less.
  sec: 3212
  time: '53:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. I guess it shouldn't be difficult, depending on what your hiring manager
    or the potential team that your company that you're applying to – what they're
    looking for. I would say, with that experience – so if you have experience as
    a data engineer or a data analyst – I think you know a fair deal of how the data
    science teams work. You also understand a lot of the stakeholders, so that is
    to your advantage. You need to focus on your leadership skills. Why are you the
    right person to lead this team? And if you can convince them of that, then I think
    you should get the job.
  sec: 3236
  time: '53:56'
  who: Sadat
- line: That's the homework we talked about, when we were talking about getting an
    engineering management position.
  sec: 3267
  time: '54:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Create your brag list.
  sec: 3275
  time: '54:35'

    data science. Right?
  sec: 3278
  time: '54:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. Definitely applies.
  sec: 3286

  sec: 3289

  sec: 3293
  time: '54:53'
  who: Sadat
- line: Why did you not save it?
  sec: 3298
  time: '54:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Every time I tried to save it, a file name… I don't know. No reason. I'm thinking
    about it, and there's no reason. I could have just called it braglist.txt and
    saved it. I didn't want to call it a brag list. Maybe a little bit of that. The
    name is… [cross-talk]
  sec: 3301
  time: '55:01'
  who: Sadat
- line: Call just “a list”?
  sec: 3320
  time: '55:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, maybe. It's an outrageous name “brag list”.
  sec: 3322
  time: '55:22'
  who: Sadat
- line: Or “work list”?
  sec: 3326
  time: '55:26'
  who: Alexey

    Google Docs.
  sec: 3326
  time: '55:26'
  who: Sadat
- line: So you still keep it?
  sec: 3337
  time: '55:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: I still have it. I still add to it whenever I feel that I have done something
    worth mentioning.
  sec: 3339
  time: '55:39'
  who: Sadat
- line: Yeah. How do you… because you actually didn't do it, right? Somebody else
    did this. You were just standing there. [chuckles] At least, when I was managing
    a team, this is how I felt.
  sec: 3347
  time: '55:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: What you need to understand – this is a very good question – yes and no. Because
    the thing is, had you not been there, do you think similar outcomes would have
    been achieved?
  sec: 3360
  time: '56:00'
  who: Sadat
- line: How do you know? You cannot test this. [laughs]
  sec: 3371
  time: '56:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: You cannot test it with an A/B test, but you can, for example, go through
    the journey of the team or the project, and see areas where you had key insight,
    and where what you uncovered or what you discussed changed the direction of the
    project. This is going to be there. If you are doing your job right, you are going
    to find instances where, had you not been present the outcome would have been
    slightly or significantly different. That is what differentiates a good manager
    from a bad one. At the end of the day, if you're getting paid – and I believe
    this firmly – if I am getting paid to do something, the value that I bring should
    be more than the value that I take out. It's simple math.
  sec: 3376
  time: '56:16'
  who: Sadat
- line: That's the validation, right? If you check your bank account and you see some
    money, then you're still doing well, right? [chuckles]
  sec: 3427
  time: '57:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I would want to evaluate it even closer. [Alexey chuckles] Not only on
    that high. That is definitely a very good evaluation, but I would also want to
    have other “health metrics,” so to say.
  sec: 3435
  time: '57:15'
  who: Sadat
- line: What are those metrics?
  sec: 3450
  time: '57:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, there’s one thing that I do look out for – this isn’t very concrete.
    What I do look out for, for example, now as a data science manager, I have a lot
    of interactions with stakeholders and product managers, and engineering managers
    – and the amount of influence that I have, where I can change their opinion from
    one to another and then, “Does my proposed solution deliver value?” If A and B
    are there, then I am very happy at consuming the money that my employer deposited
    in my bank account. If not, I would want to get feedback and improve.
  sec: 3454
  time: '57:34'
  who: Sadat
- line: Okay. And you put these things in your brag list.
  sec: 3493
  time: '58:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Some of it. When it's successful, it ends up in the brag list. But when it's
    in progress, there's probably another unsaved Sublime document somewhere. [chuckles]
  sec: 3497

- line: '[laughs] Okay. Do you have any books or other resources in mind that you
    can recommend to the listeners?'
  sec: 3508
  time: '58:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have read a few books on management. I can recommend a few books on management.
    But my style has always been “Ride a bicycle to learn how to ride a bicycle.”
    You have to do it before in order to understand how it's done. It's a very agile
    methodology, “Start, and then iterate and improve.” One book that I read is called
    The Manager's Path. It's written by a Facebook employee (or an ex-Facebook employee)
    and she describes her journey from the early days of Facebook and how it scales.
    I think that that will definitely help. There are a few other books that don't
    stand out because all of the stuff that you read in them is stuff like you hear
    in a podcast like this, right? Somebody else's journey – it might or might not
    relate to you. Make your own journey.
  sec: 3516

  sec: 3568
  time: '59:28'
  who: Sadat

    engineering managers. I saw that they have this book on their desks. It was before
    Corona, when people actually came to the office.
  sec: 3570
  time: '59:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'There''s another one, from the founders of Netflix, No Rules Rules: Netflix
    and the Culture of Reinvention. It''s more about culture, how you want to drive
    your team''s culture. I think that''s a very important part of being a team leader.
    I like that book. It''s unique. We are definitely not running OLX with those principles.
    But it''s nice to see how certain rules are maybe superfluous and can be done
    away with. The story is – make your own journey. Understand and learn from others,
    but make your own.'

- line: Oh! So glad you asked. I'm not hosting this one under the banner of the Search
    Meetup, but I am going to be hosting another meetup at OLX on the 7th of December,
    6 PM. The topics are going to be around bias and fairness in AI. How would you
    measure that? And how would you counter that? It's co-organized by wonderful people
    at Toloka, which is kind of like Amazon Turk – human annotation crowdsourcing.
    So if you're in Berlin and if you want to enjoy good food, good conversation,
    and networking with great people – then show up at our offices at Alexanderplatz.
    [Alexey agrees] You might also see Alexey there.
