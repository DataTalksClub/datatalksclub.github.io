  who: Demetrios
- line: Thanks, everybody for joining us today. Today the topic is a bit different
    from what we usually have. But I really wanted to talk about this thing because
    data talks are an online community, machine learning, Ml ops is an online community.
    We have so many online communities. There are not too many talks about that, especially
    in the space of machine learning data science and I always wanted to get Demetrios
    on the podcast, because A) he had me on the MLOps community podcast, B) I wanted
    to get him back. I wanted to talk to somebody about building online communities.
    Who else could be a better fit for that than you, Demetrios? So thanks a lot for
    joining us today.

  who: Alexey
- line: My pleasure to be here. I really appreciate you having me on. It's very cool
    and nice of you because you actually had something to say, when I had you on.
    I'm not sure if I'm going to have much to say. But you're very kind in making
    this around communities. Maybe I can share a few words of wisdom.

- header: Starting the MLOps community
- line: So let's start. Before we go into the main topic about online communities,
    maybe you can tell us a bit about yourself. How did you end up being the mastermind
    behind this thriving big, lovely online community that has 3000 members right
    now. How did it start for you?

  who: Alexey
- line: "It was all by chance. I was doing sales work for a company \u201Cdot science\u201D\
    . I think I tried to sell it to you even."

  who: Demetrios

  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I did try to sell. You didn't buy. But at least our relationship went somewhere.\
    \ I was doing the heavy and hard legwork of reaching out to people, trying to\
    \ get them to look at our MLOps tool called \u201Cdot science\u201D. I was having\
    \ \u201Cokay\u201D success with it. Then COVID hit. And when COVID hit, nobody\
    \ wanted to take a meeting with me. My job became really, really hard. Our old\
    \ CEO had the brilliant idea. He comes from the Docker space. He had the brilliant\
    \ idea of \u201Cwhy don't we have a community\u201D, because the community needs\
    \ to form around MLOps. We had been calling it DevOps for ML for like six months.\
    \ But then MLOps term started to be used more and more. I know it's been debated\
    \ who created that term. I know that Data Robot has ownership of it. Someone pointed\
    \ that out to us in the community that they actually have a trademark on that."

  time: '2:06'
  who: Demetrios
- line: "The thing that happened let me \u2014 for the time being, let me just start\
    \ interviewing people. And we'll see where that goes. I had read enough books\
    \ on marketing. I had actually wanted to create a podcast at my last job, which\
    \ was in sales also. I was at this password management company. I wanted to create\
    \ a podcast there. I felt like it would be a great way to have an excuse to talk\
    \ to people that I don't usually get to talk to \u2014 that wouldn't answer my\
    \ phone calls or that wouldn't talk to me. I did end up getting to talk to you.\
    \ It just wasn't about the tool. It was about actually more informative stuff.\
    \ We could argue that it was better in the end. I wanted to start a podcast. At\
    \ the last company they asked me, do you have anything of you actually doing it?"
  who: Demetrios
- line: "They didn't trust that I was going to be any good at it, which is a fair\
    \ assessment \u2014 because I'm not sure if I am any good. That never went anywhere.\
    \ It never got off the ground. When we decided to do the podcast and the meetup,\
    \ really it was a meetup. It started as a meetup and I was like, we should just\
    \ record it and make it into a podcast. So we went from there. We also started\
    \ a forum in the beginning, not just the slack. Nobody was using the forum after\
    \ the first two months. So we stopped with that. But it was a place to congregate.\
    \ From the beginning it was meant to be vendor agnostic \u2014 which was interesting\
    \ to think about, because my CEO was the one who told us to do it. It wasn't connected\
    \ to the company that we're working at \u2014 DOT science."
  who: Demetrios
- line: "But it was, in a way, like, \u201Cyou should do this. it might help.\u201D\
    \ So we did it. Then it was vendor agnostic. We didn't have to worry about selling\
    \ our product. In fact, we were very much against that idea. A month later, the\
    \ company went out of business. I definitely didn't have to worry about selling\
    \ anything. Then I just kept interviewing people. The company was out of business,\
    \ but I was enjoying interviewing people. The company went out of business in\
    \ May, and I had scheduled meetups every week, until mid-June or July. That's\
    \ what made me be like, wow, there's actually something here, people are enjoying\
    \ this. Or at least people are willing to talk to me. I don't know if people were\
    \ actually enjoying it."
  who: Demetrios
- line: I did.
  sec: 396
  time: '6:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: "You enjoyed the process. I don't know if people enjoyed what you said. It\
    \ was a good time, man. I was learning a ton. You'll see that if you go back to\
    \ the first meetups that I hosted. I didn't ever ask any follow up questions.\
    \ One of the first meetup guests, Charles, made fun of me. He was like, \u201C\
    I'm not sure I want you to tell me the answer, but whenever you get the responses\
    \ from people, you do this gazing off, like you're deep in contemplation. Then\
    \ you ask the next question and I'm just wondering, if you're deep in contemplation\
    \ about what that person said, like, it's so profound, or you have no idea what\
    \ they just said, and you're trying to understand it.\u201D"

  who: Demetrios
- line: Which was it?
  sec: 451
  time: '7:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm not gonna tell. I didn't know what people were talking about in the beginning.
    I didn't have any way to actually follow up. I was just there trying to hold on.
    I had prepared questions that I would ask people, and I prepared everything beforehand.
    I would generally just go through those questions that I prepared, and I wouldn't
    have any back and forth. By the time you came on, I was starting to feel more
    comfortable. Now I feel too comfortable.

    LinkedIn posts.

  time: '8:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: "If you want to go way back, for sure. I got out of the US as soon as I graduated\
    \ University. I wanted to not be in the US. I went to Spain, which is a long story\
    \ on why I settled on Bilbao, Spain. We can say that in the next DataTalks.Club\
    \ chat we have. But I ended up in Bilbao. I was there. The easiest way for me\
    \ to stay there was to teach English. I also wanted to learn Spanish. I graduated\
    \ with a degree in Spanish and Portuguese. I had been in Brazil and I knew quite\
    \ a bit of Portuguese. I also knew Spanish, but I didn't know enough to be like,\
    \ \u201Chey, I have this degree in it.\u201D I should be fluent. I stayed there\
    \ for a few years teaching English. Then I met my wife and had a daughter. Then\
    \ didn't leave for a long time. From there it was really easy to teach English.\
    \ It was like this flywheel where you just go and you do it and you teach English.\
    \ But it wasn't fulfilling at all."
  sec: 509
  time: '8:29'
  who: Demetrios
- line: "I felt I wasn't learning much because I spoke English. I was learning about\
    \ how to be a teacher in the beginning and learning how to talk to people. You\
    \ could argue that that helped me with this kind of stuff. But after eight years\
    \ of it, it gets very monotonous. I was looking for a way out. A friend got a\
    \ job in sales at that password management company. Then I went from there into\
    \ sales, which is \u2014 just shouting out to all the sales people there \u2014\
    \ it\u2019s hard work. I will say that. Then I got out of sales, which is another\
    \ one where it's like, \u201COh, I got lucky.\u201D I was able to get out of that.\
    \ I got lucky getting out of English teaching because I didn't want to be a lifer.\
    \ I didn't want to be 40 and still be talking about the past participle."
  who: Demetrios
- header: How sales skills can be helpful in getting speakers
- line: "I guess the skills you picked up when you were working in sales, they're\
    \ pretty helpful in\u2026 \u201Cclosings\u201D the speakers. First of all, finding\
    \ people to talk to, then convincing them to get on your podcast, then finally\
    \ getting them, and talking to them on the podcast."
  sec: 641
  time: '10:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "You've probably seen this too. Within the ML space, it feels like it's really\
    \ easy to get people to come on. I also had the community \u201CData on Kubernetes\u201D\
    , which I think you wanted to talk about, too. In that space, it was much harder\
    \ to get people to come on. There I needed the sales skills, which is just basically\
    \ being persistent. If you're persistent, you're gonna get a \u201Cno\u201D or\
    \ \u201Cyes\u201D, but you're gonna get something. And I don't stop until I get\
    \ something. Some people will stop asking after 10 times. But if you've done sales\
    \ enough, then you know, I shouldn't stop asking until 20 times. Or until I get\
    \ that \u201Cno\u201D. Just tell me \u201Cno\u201D and I'll go away on the first\
    \ time."
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Demetrios
- line: "There were some definite skills that were useful. They transferred over well.\
    \ But in MLOps you don't need it. I don't think it's necessarily needed, because\
    \ people are willing to talk. It's not so saturated. With a million different\
    \ podcasts and a million different communities that you get the same response,\
    \ like when in the Kubernetes land. I think in Kubernetes, it's different because\
    \ there are so many different companies that have their own podcasts, and they\
    \ have their own community, and they have all of this. When I would approach people,\
    \ they would be like, okay. And ask a bunch of questions. My least favorite question\
    \ was, \u201Chow big is your audience?\u201D That's what I told him: \u201Cthere\
    \ are only four people watching live on YouTube.\u201D"

- line: "Let's talk a bit about the community you built. I don't know how many people\
    \ per day join. But every time I see the number of members, I think, it increases\
    \ by 100 members per day. So this is an awesome growth. But it didn\u2019t start\
    \ like that. In the beginning, you needed to get some traction. How did it start\
    \ for you? First, you started with events with speakers. How you \u2014 as a community\
    \ \u2014 how did you manage to get this traction? What did you need to do?"

  who: Alexey
- line: "One thing that we did \u2014 which is quite useful if you're building a community\
    \ \u2014 I reached out to a bunch of random people on LinkedIn. That's where I\
    \ felt the majority of the people were. And it's easier to connect with people\
    \ on LinkedIn. I remember I would tell them, \u201CHey, I'm stuck inside and I\
    \ wanted to do something useful with my time inside. I started this community.\
    \ If you're interested in MLOps, come join us.\u201D I was doing a lot of cold\
    \ outreach. That was all me. That's why in the beginning I was working like crazy.\
    \ It's a lot of work to try and set it up and it was slow coming. It felt like\
    \ it was like blowing up from the beginning \u2014 if we got 20 people in the\
    \ slack and we had 15 people in a meetup. I was like, \u201Cwow, there are so\
    \ many people, and this is huge now\u201D. Then I stopped. I remember, there was\
    \ a point when I stopped doing outreach. Probably like a month after we started\
    \ the community."
  sec: 842
  time: '14:02'
  who: Demetrios
- line: "And people kept coming into the community randomly. I was like, \u201CWhoa,\
    \ how did that happen? I haven't been telling people about it. Where are they\
    \ finding out about it?\u201D Especially in the beginning, it was just me and\
    \ somebody gave some great feedback to me in the beginning, when I was asking\
    \ for feedback. Somebody said, \u201Cthis is not yet a community\u201D. They were\
    \ like, \u201CDon't take this the wrong way. But I don't feel this as a community\
    \ yet. I feel this is just Demetrios sharing stuff that he finds online and thinks\
    \ is useful.\u201D In a way, it was. I was the most active member. I was always\
    \ trying to keep things happening. Keep things new so that people would come back.\
    \ Trying to tag different people into conversations. But it wasn't like what you\
    \ see now where people ask questions, and then others answer them. I would always\
    \ have to be involved in some way."
  who: Demetrios
- line: "I don't think we get like 100 a day unless you tweet out something about\
    \ the community. We usually will get like 100 a week. I think it\u2019s probably\
    \ more realistic on a good week. Did that answer the question?"
  who: Demetrios
- line: "I think you did. The first thing you did was cold outreach. And I think these\
    \ terms are coming from sales, which means \u2014 to translate it to the language\
    \ that most of us understand \u2014 writing random people on LinkedIn saying,\
    \ \u201CHey, join our community.\u201D That helped to get some traction. You also\
    \ mentioned that, at the beginning, it was just you sharing some articles you\
    \ found online, just to keep the place live. \u201CThis is what I found, what\
    \ do you think about this?\u201D Then eventually you stopped doing this. People\
    \ still took this on and kept posting things. So it's a lot of hard work that\
    \ you did at the beginning. For how long did you do this before stopping the outreach?\
    \ I think you said for one month?"

  who: Alexey
- line: "Month and a half. Also the other parts that were really hard \u2014 which\
    \ you're going through now, I'm sure \u2014 are the editing of videos. I was making\
    \ a ton of clips. I wanted to just get our presence on YouTube. Out of every hour-long\
    \ session, I would make five or six clips of my favorite answers. That was a way\
    \ for me to go back and review what people said. I remember after the third or\
    \ fourth time watching it in the video editor I would go like, \u201CI think I\
    \ know what they're talking about now\u201D. That helps me to get my MLOps chops.\
    \ I don't feel like the community actually really got rolling. In June, I remember\
    \ telling a friend of mine that if we can hit 500 slack members, that would be\
    \ huge. That would be a great milestone. We hit that and then my friend asked,\
    \ \u201CWhat's next? Is it going to be 1000 before the New Year?\u201D"

  who: Demetrios
- line: "I was like, \u201CNo way. That's a lot.\u201D It took us three months or\
    \ four months to hit 500. Let's sustain this growth. That's all I cared about.\
    \ 1000 before the new year, maybe, but I'm not going to put any pressure on myself.\
    \ Because I figured that everybody that cared about MLOps had joined already.\
    \ I didn't think there was gonna be that many people. Then when we hit 1000, it\
    \ was right around September and I was like, \u201CWhoa, that was fast\u201D.\
    \ Then we hit 2000, before the end of the year. Now we just hit 3000. And it's\
    \ like, \u201COkay, this is doing that whole exponential growth\u201D thing."
  who: Demetrios
- line: With more people comes different problems, I would say. Or different things
    that you have to worry about. In the beginning, when it was just 10 people, you
    knew everyone and everyone knew you. You knew who was active. Now there's a ton
    of people around so you got to moderate wisely.
  who: Demetrios
- header: Community moderations and dealing with problems
- line: What kind of problems you have? First of all, a lot of people and most of
    them, you don't know and you need to moderate. Are there some other problems like
    spam? How do you deal with them?

- line: "We talked about this last week \u2014 the code of conduct. It feels like\
    \ every day I'm trying to walk the fine line of what a vendor can and can't do\
    \ in the community. All the vendors are really excited about MLOps community.\
    \ If they don't read the code of conduct, then they come in, and they just start\
    \ spraying their product all over the place. It's like, what are you doing, man?\
    \ First of all, you're not going to get many sales like that, me knowing it as\
    \ an ex salesman. The other thing is that we have a closed vendor channel. There\
    \ are over 100 people in that channel. Imagine if every single one of those vendors\
    \ did the same thing. Then every thread would just be 100 vendors spraying their\
    \ product. It's never going to create a conducive environment for the community\
    \ to grow. That is one that gives me a bit of a headache especially when I know\
    \ these guys."

    Come on, dude, we know each other. We've had conversations, and you can't do that.\u201D\
    \ Then when you say you can't do that for one, then if another one does it, they\
    \ come to you and they say, \u201CWell, why can they do it?\u201D I compare it\
    \ to siblings. If one kid gets a candy, then I want a candy too. I don't want\
    \ to dog on the vendors. I love the vendors. We are so happy that they're there,\
    \ when they contribute their knowledge. The vendors are the people with the most\
    \ advanced understanding of MLOps right now. They are the ones that are building\
    \ the tools. If they come in and give their knowledge, without creating your commercial\
    \ out of it, it's so valuable for the community. But as soon as it becomes, \u201C\
    Just try my product, it's cool\u201D. Or they reach out and they DM someone because\
    \ they saw a question that they're asking in the channel. Then it's like, \u201C\
    Dude, you can't do that\u201D. Ego battles that you have with people. I try to\
    \ just tell people \u201CHey, just be cool. You don't need to get riled up about\
    \ anything. We're talking about MLOps. It's not politics.\u201D"

    people less shy when it comes to speaking up in slack. I think the majority of
    people that are in slack are just lurking, and they're not saying much. They're
    just looking at everything. A lot of people feel like they don't have anything
    to contribute. A lot of people just don't want to contribute. You get a lot of

    out there and put yourself out there. Because people aren't going to necessarily
    see your introduction, and then reach out to you, unless it's a really good introduction.
    Even then, you're not going to get that many people reaching out to you for your
    introduction. That's something that I try and do is when I see great introductions,
    or when I see people that are in certain fields, I'll try and tag them into different
    questions that arise. But you're not going to get people coming with open arms,
    if you're not really showing anything about you. I think a part of that has to
    be put on you. You have to put forth a little bit of effort.

- line: We have the sprint plantings that help. Then just giving people a lot of autonomy.
    And recognizing that it is a community, and people aren't getting paid. Not really
    pressuring them or holding them to what they say so much. But you have to be very
    clear about what you're going for. You can engage more people in the community.
    You can get people more interested. Like the website. That's probably what's taking
    the longest, because we're engaging so many people. When it's just me, I do shit
    fast. It was me in the beginning. It was me doing it, I was working myself to
    the bone.

    \ I'm doing. The things that I'm doing just have momentum. They're happening.\
    \ But then there's all this other crazy stuff that we think up and think \u201C\
    This could be cool, let's try that. What about if we did this? What about if we\
    \ did that?\u201D Then we see who in the community wants to get involved? We see\
    \ if it's actually a viable option. With all those different things, it's really\
    \ hard to get done. Imagine if you had like six things going on and you didn't\
    \ have a leader. Imagine you had 20 people. And everybody was just like, \u201C\
    Well, my thing is the most important. I think we should do it like this.\u201D\
    \ Then nobody actually has decision making power. Then it's really difficult to\
    \ get anything done. I'm not saying it's bad. It's totally a viable way to go\
    \ about doing your stuff. If you want to have and structure your community like\
    \ that, go for it. Coming from Spain I know, especially in the northern part of\
    \ Spain, in the Basque Country, that was like the de facto way of doing everything.\
    \ I would just say it was the biggest pain in the ass for me because I wanted\
    \ to just go. To go through all of the bureaucracy. It was a lot of work in it.\
    \ It slowed me down, and then I would lose interest. But if I'm like \u201CI can\
    \ do this\u201D. Then I'm just gonna go, and boom \u2014 I'm going to be much\
    \ more inspired."

- line: That's amazing. Do you consider a community a business? Not necessarily the
    MLOps community, but in general, any community? That's, again, a question from
    Sviat. If yes, what is the business goal? What would be the business goal for
    that community?
  sec: 3652

    \ goal in my mind is to create a place where people can learn, they can share\
    \ and they can interact. It's not like to make profits for our shareholders. It's\
    \ to create a place where people can get the most value in this specific space.\
    \ That's how I look at MLOps community. Communities in general \u2014 there are\
    \ so many different ways. One, if it's an open source community\u2014 yes, it's\
    \ a business. You see so many different companies that are being created on top\
    \ of open source. What is the goal of the business? If it's an open source thing,\
    \ if it's a business on top of an open source community, then it's obvious that\
    \ the goal is to make money."

    \ a place that thrives and is constantly attracting new customers''. It has the\
    \ marketing side, and it has the product side. Even though the product of the\
    \ community \u2014 I'm not sure what that would be, other than the different initiatives\
    \ that are brought to us? Podcasts... or newsletters \u2014 more marketing. The\
    \ way that we're running MLOps community is like, it's an educational business.\
    \ We're just not getting... The people are learning, they're not paying for their\
    \ learning, which is fine with me right now. I don't want it to be behind a paywall.\
    \ We had thought about it. We threw around ideas of creating courses. But in the\
    \ end, we said, \u201CNo, we're not going to do it right now because everything's\
    \ moving too fast\u201D. By the time we launch a course, who knows where it'll\

    is gonna be around in a year or two? That's a little bit of a cop out as to why
    we didn't start a course. It just felt a lot of squeezing for the juice. Does
    that answer the question?

- header: Five steps for starting a community in 2021
- line: I think it does. We still have quite a few questions. If somebody wants to
    start a community right now in a familiar topic, or in the topic they know about,
    what would you suggest them to do? What are the main five points you will suggest
    to them.
  sec: 3851
  time: '1:04:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Figure out where you want the community to be. Is it going to be in slack?
    Is it going to be in discord? There's a lot of new community tools that are coming
    up. Like circle or comissar. I think I told you I had a demo with them. They're
    more of an analytics tool for your community. But there are tools that look scarily
    like Facebook, but it's for your community. So, figure out where you want your
    community to live. At least in the beginning, it should probably just be on one
    of these platforms. Then when you grow bigger, you can go into forums and slack
    or discord and have both.
  sec: 3893
  time: '1:04:53'
  who: Demetrios
- line: Then what's the common goal that unites the community? Why would anyone want
    to come and be a part of this community? What are they coming there for? Figure
    out those questions. Then how are you going to feed that hunger that they have?
    Is it just going to be people talking on slack? Are you going to create blog posts?
    Are you going to create content in general? It could be a podcast, it could be
    a newsletter, whatever. Nurture the community in that way.
  who: Demetrios
- line: "Then \u2014 who are people that are going to be in the community? Because\
    \ you have this common thread then you can go and start finding them wherever\
    \ they are, and start talking to them. Mention how you have a community also,\
    \ or you have this community that you just started. For me, it was easy finding\
    \ them on LinkedIn, if it's a professional facing community. I think it's gonna\
    \ be a lot harder, if it's a toe fetish community. Where do you find those people?\
    \ Because I know you're into that, Alexey. So I'm wondering, where do you guys\
    \ hang out?"

  sec: 4039
  time: '1:07:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sorry to make you blush, and tell all of your followers that you're into that.
    But where do you find them? I genuinely think it's easier to find people on LinkedIn,
    if it's around a professional network. You could technically say that a Facebook
    group is a community. Maybe that's where you find people. Maybe you find them
    in the comment section of a YouTube video. Where do these people hang out? And
    why are they going to want to go hang out in this community that you're starting?

    \ four things?"
  sec: 4111

    I think you can find all sorts of people on reddit. I think that's all for today.

    going on. Talking to you about this is really cool. Because it helps me formulate
    my ideas. I've thought about if I should just start making YouTube videos about
    creating community? How to create it? I'm not going to claim to be an expert in
    communities, because I know there are a lot of people out there with a lot more
    experience than myself. I just want to tell the story of how I created it. What's
    worked for me, what I've tried, what didn't work in these three communities that
    I've created thus far. Thanks everybody for listening. I can't believe that they're
