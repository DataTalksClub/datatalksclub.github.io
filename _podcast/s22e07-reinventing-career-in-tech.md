    Club, a community of people who love data. We have weekly events, and you can
    find more details in the link in the description. Subscribe to our YouTube channel
    to get notified about all future events. We also have an amazing Slack community
    where you can interact with other data enthusiasts and ask questions.
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: During today's interview, you can ask any question through the pinned link
    in the live chat, and we will cover them during the session. I used to use Grammarly
    but stopped a while ago. There’s a meetup in Berlin about how Grammarly uses LLMs,
    which sounds interesting. Now that the intro is done, I have the questions file
    ready. If you're ready, we can start.
  sec: 36
  time: 0:36
  who: Alexey
- line: By the way, you have very nice earrings.
  sec: 85
  time: '1:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you.
  sec: 90
  time: '1:30'
  who: Xia
- line: This week we'll talk about career transitions, leadership, and building inclusive
    data teams. We have a very special guest today. Xia is the head of data and cloud
    at NOV, a German company supporting the transition to zero-emission mobility through
    data and cloud innovation. Her journey from being a full-time mom to leading a
    data team is a story of resilience, growth, and inclusion. Welcome to our event.
  sec: 96
  time: '1:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you, Alexey. I’m happy to be here.
  sec: 142
  time: '2:22'
  who: Xia
- line: We have interacted before, including during your courses and a recent lunch.
    It’s very pleasant to have you here. I want to start with your background. Can
    you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 147
  time: '2:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I studied automotive engineering in China, Italy, and France. Moving
    to Germany was never part of my plan. I had the chance to study at TU Munich but
    declined because it was too cold. I studied in Lyon, which was very nice, and
    later moved to Berlin when my husband relocated.
  sec: 174
  time: '2:54'
  who: Xia
- line: It was very difficult to find a good job in the automotive industry in Berlin.
    I got married and had two children, so I spent four to five years at home. I tried
    one job that was not relevant to my studies, just to get back into work. In 2018,
    I decided to study data science and become a data scientist.
  sec: 219
  time: '3:39'
  who: Xia
- line: I pursued a second master’s in data science at HTW Berlin. I changed jobs
    frequently, almost every year, until I found my current role at NOV, which I find
    meaningful. The company culture is excellent, and I’m very motivated. I was promoted
    in a very short time.
  sec: 265
  time: '4:25'
  who: Xia
- line: You’ve been doing data science since 2018, so roughly seven years. That’s
    quite a lot.
  sec: 311
  time: '5:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Do you remember the times before AI, when everything had to be done manually?
  sec: 330
  time: '5:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. It was difficult, especially with two children and a completely different
    background.
  sec: 337
  time: '5:37'
  who: Xia
- line: Can you tell us more about what you studied to make this transition? You mentioned
    a master’s, but it must have been challenging.
  sec: 349
  time: '5:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: The turning point came unexpectedly. A British headhunter called me and asked
    if I knew machine learning. They were looking for someone with a mechanical engineering
    background for a robotics startup. I had never heard of machine learning or reinforcement
    learning before.
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Xia
- line: I had spent so much time with my children that I felt out of society. I decided
    I wanted to do something for myself and took action. I found a master’s program
    at HTW Berlin, which focused on data science project management, combining R,
    statistics, and advanced data analysis.
  sec: 405
  time: '6:45'
  who: Xia
- line: I was not fully satisfied, as it didn’t make me a data scientist at that time.
    I also took many courses in Coursera, including Andrew Ng’s deep learning specialization,
    which inspired me. I gained broad knowledge of machine learning and deep learning.
  sec: 453
  time: '7:33'
  who: Xia
- line: I also started with Andrew Ng’s courses. They have grown into a specialization
    now.
  sec: 495
  time: '8:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Did you ever use R outside your studies?
  sec: 519
  time: '8:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, not really. I had an internship that required Python, which I was not
    familiar with. It was a very challenging experience.
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Xia
- line: Finding your first internship and job must have been difficult, especially
    with two children. How did your previous background help?
  sec: 557
  time: '9:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was challenging. I partly got the internship because of my automotive engineering
    background. The consultants needed someone with that experience, so I had a practical
    advantage. Andrew Ng’s courses helped me a lot, especially for practical interview
    questions.
  sec: 586
  time: '9:46'
  who: Xia
- line: So your previous experience helped you get started, similar to my own experience
    transitioning from Java development.
  sec: 638
  time: '10:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, every experience helps. Even the unrelated jobs I had while raising my
    children helped me meet university requirements. I always try to learn something
    from every experience.
  sec: 678
  time: '11:18'
  who: Xia
- line: What did you do as an import expert?
  sec: 731
  time: '12:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I bought and exported German goods to China via online platforms and imported
    Chinese goods to Germany.
  sec: 741
  time: '12:21'
  who: Xia
- line: So they needed someone who spoke both Chinese and German.
  sec: 753
  time: '12:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly.
  sec: 760
  time: '12:40'
  who: Xia
- line: Even if it wasn’t related to your ultimate goal, it helped you get started.
  sec: 765
  time: '12:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it was challenging in the beginning, but I made the best out of it.
  sec: 770
  time: '12:50'
  who: Xia
- line: At some point, you came across our courses and Zoom Camps. Can you tell us
    how that happened?
  sec: 781
  time: '13:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I took many courses on Coursera, Udemy, and other platforms. They were mostly
    theoretical but gave me broad knowledge. I followed your courses at the very beginning
    during COVID when I was home with two children.
  sec: 792
  time: '13:12'
  who: Xia
- line: 'I completed two Zoom Camps: Data Engineering and MLOps. Both were challenging
    and helpful. I had to use Docker, Terraform, and cloud tools, which was overwhelming
    at first. The second camp was easier.'
  sec: 827
  time: '13:47'
  who: Xia
- line: I built an automatic end-to-end data pipeline with a nice CO2 dashboard. These
    skills helped me in interviews and at work. I credit these courses for helping
    me land two jobs.
  sec: 875
  time: '14:35'
  who: Xia
- line: You mentioned your first and second jobs after the courses. What helped you
    the most from these courses? Was it the projects, the skills you gained, or something
    else?
  sec: 900
  time: '15:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think the design of the courses is excellent. They focus on real use cases
    we see in daily work. The instructors are professionals from other companies and
    bring their perspectives into the courses. The final projects let you combine
    everything you learned to build a portfolio. For interviews, this shows if a person
    is motivated and can work independently.
  sec: 918
  time: '15:18'
  who: Xia
- line: You have two kids, worked, and took these challenging courses. How did you
    manage your time, especially with module one of the Data Engineering course?
  sec: 970
  time: '16:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Module one turned out to be very difficult, even though I expected it to be
    easy. At the time, my kids were in kindergarten, and I had a job. From 9:00 p.m.
    to midnight every day, I spent two to three hours learning and doing projects.
    I was very curious and absorbed knowledge like a sponge. I even explored web development
    and AI EOS development to understand how things work, even if it wasn’t directly
    related to data science.
  sec: 1002
  time: '16:42'
  who: Xia
- line: That’s impressive. Learning web development helps even when you don’t need
    to code daily, especially for understanding code generated by AI tools.
  sec: 1131
  time: '18:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: You mentioned that these courses helped you land two jobs. Can you tell us
    more about the first and second ones?
  sec: 1185
  time: '19:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first job was as an AI and data consultant in a big consulting company.
    The interview focused on machine learning, so I reviewed the machine learning
    Zoom Camp to refresh concepts, which helped me present well. The second job was
    as a data engineer at NOV. I benefited a lot from the courses since our tech stack
    included AWS, Docker, and Terraform.
  sec: 1210
  time: '20:10'
  who: Xia
- line: You started at NOW as a data engineer. Now you are head of data and cloud.
    How did that transition happen?
  sec: 1276
  time: '21:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: It wasn’t planned. I am spontaneous and don’t plan my life years ahead. I
    started as a data engineer, imagining I could grow into a senior role and mentor
    juniors. The real trigger was a company working group for data science.
  sec: 1309
  time: '21:49'
  who: Xia
- line: The group allowed data people across teams to exchange knowledge and attend
    events. I wanted to contribute to the community, so I took responsibility for
    initiatives, such as AWS certification sprints and promoting diversity. These
    efforts gave me more impact and satisfaction beyond technical work.
  sec: 1351
  time: '22:31'
  who: Xia
- line: Later, the head of data left, leaving a big gap. I stepped in because I had
    the most knowledge of AWS. I continued my daily work while taking on these responsibilities.
  sec: 1501
  time: '25:01'
  who: Xia
- line: When I transitioned from senior to tech leadership, I couldn’t maintain my
    previous workload. Did you manage both your daily work and these new responsibilities
    simultaneously?
  sec: 1560
  time: '26:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I didn’t manage people at first but took over coordination and technical
    responsibilities from the other team. Later, as head of data, I focus on team
    building and strategic planning.
  sec: 1588
  time: '26:28'
  who: Xia
- line: How does your day look now?
  sec: 1656
  time: '27:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s very busy. I joined three months ago and focused on team building, introducing
    new structures and routines, prioritizing projects, and addressing backlogs. I
    also focus on innovative projects for the future and securing budget and resources.
  sec: 1665
  time: '27:45'
  who: Xia
- line: How did you learn to handle all these responsibilities in the first 100 days?
    What resources helped you?
  sec: 1737
  time: '28:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I learned a lot from my previous team and team lead. Observing how they worked
    gave me a role model. I could adopt their methods rather than starting from scratch.
    The strong team spirit made the transition smoother.
  sec: 1770
  time: '29:30'
  who: Xia
- line: I didn't start from zero. I immediately booked a coaching course, which helped
    me because leadership is like a new language or a new field. There are frameworks
    and tools, and no one is born a leader. If you are interested in people and can
    reflect, you can be a good leader.
  sec: 1816
  time: '30:16'
  who: Xia
- line: In terms of resources, I took a course from the Hula Academy, which I can
    recommend. The trainer was really nice and it helped me reflect and gave practical
    tools. The second resource is the book How to Win Friends and Influence People.
    It's a classic book that gives general guidance on interacting with people.
  sec: 1854
  time: '30:54'
  who: Xia
- line: There’s also a movie called How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. It's
    a dark English comedy. I never managed to finish the book How to Win Friends and
    Influence People; I tried multiple times. I read it on a long trip to Canada while
    staying in an Airbnb. Some ideas in the book are reasonable but challenging to
    implement.
  sec: 1942
  time: '32:22'
  who: Xia
- line: I see a few questions from the audience. One person asks about transitioning
    back to data and AI after time in management. Do you have recommendations for
    them?
  sec: 2008
  time: '33:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is something I have thought about. I enjoy programming and solving complex
    problems, but as a head of data, I don’t have much time for hands-on work. I thought
    I could spend 20% of my time coding, but that was naive. Before this interview,
    I did some Terraform refactoring with a colleague.
  sec: 2037
  time: '33:57'
  who: Xia
- line: 'My suggestion is to talk with your manager if the culture is open and supportive.
    It’s good to explore and see if it fits. If not, it’s okay to change. In my last
    company, Elix, we had two career tracks: individual contributor and management.'
  sec: 2088
  time: '34:48'
  who: Xia
- line: In the individual contributor track, there are technical leadership roles
    like staff or principal engineer. In management, roles include manager, head of
    data, or engineering manager. Lateral moves are possible. For example, a head
    of data could transition to a principal engineer role to be more hands-on. The
    reverse is also possible.
  sec: 2137
  time: '35:37'
  who: Xia
- line: Career transitions depend on the company. If the structure is clear, it’s
    easier to move between technical and management tracks.
  sec: 2236
  time: '37:16'
  who: Xia
- line: I also want to plug our courses. In January, we start the data engineering
    course. Tomorrow we start AI Dev Tools for Zoom Camp, showing how to use tools
    like CoSora and GitHub Copilot to be a more effective engineer.
  sec: 2253
  time: '37:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I registered but haven’t had time yet. I tested AI tools for prototyping my
    website. As a former manager, I noticed my developer skills were getting rusty.
    These tools help me be productive again, almost like when I was an individual
    contributor.
  sec: 2298
  time: '38:18'
  who: Xia
- line: Another question is from Rupa, who has six years of experience and is learning
    German. They want a job in Germany. Any advice for international hiring?
  sec: 2373
  time: '39:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can’t recommend specific companies. Learning German is very important. The
    job market is competitive, but big international companies do hire. Some positions
    require B2 German level. Knowing German helped me get my first job in Germany.
  sec: 2399
  time: '39:59'
  who: Xia
- line: Focusing on German companies reduces competition. At Elix, when we opened
    a position, there could be 100 applications in minutes. Most applicants weren’t
    qualified. Targeting German-speaking companies gives you a better chance.
  sec: 2483
  time: '41:23'
  who: Xia
- line: I shared a link to your careers page. Rupa has B2 German, which is enough
    to work.
  sec: 2550
  time: '42:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did you learn German, and what’s your recommendation for people in Berlin?
  sec: 2580
  time: '43:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: I started with intensive courses. After seven or eight years, I spoke German
    every day but with poor grammar. Last year, I retook a one-year individual course
    in Berlin, which helped a lot. Depending on your level, you can do intensive daily
    lessons or focus on specific areas.
  sec: 2586
  time: '43:06'
  who: Xia
- line: I took morning classes at Deutsche Academy near Alexanderplatz, which was
    convenient. Evening classes didn’t work for me because my brain was tired after
    work. Morning classes allowed me to study German and still have time for other
    activities.
  sec: 2644
  time: '44:04'
  who: Xia
- line: At that time, I was at home and could focus on German and driving lessons.
    Morning classes helped allocate my time effectively, especially when I was managing
    my own schedule.
  sec: 2709
  time: '45:09'
  who: Xia
- line: Sometimes I didn’t have to work 40 hours a week; I could allow myself to work
    less. Other times I worked more, but as my own boss, I could manage my time. In
    a regular company, it’s a bit more difficult.
  sec: 2736
  time: '45:36'
  who: Xia
- line: How would you recommend starting a career in cloud and data?
  sec: 2748
  time: '45:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: I recommend taking courses and building projects. For example, the Data Engineering
    Zoom Camp covers all the technology we use daily. Write Terraform code and build
    projects. For consultants, certifications can also open doors, even though it’s
    a lot of theory.
  sec: 2758
  time: '45:58'
  who: Xia
- line: I never formally took AWS certification, but preparing for it helped me understand
    IAM roles, which were confusing at first. Similarly with German, I prepared for
    the B1/B2 certificate, which improved my language skills even though I didn’t
    care about the certificate itself.
  sec: 2828
  time: '47:08'
  who: Xia
- line: Setting goals and deadlines helps. For example, I set a deadline for the German
    certificate and prepared seriously for it. Having a deadline forces commitment
    and makes a big difference.
  sec: 2918
  time: '48:38'
  who: Xia
- line: Next time, we could do a podcast in German.
  sec: 2992
  time: '49:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Small talk is the most I can do now. If I were forced to work in German, I’d
    improve quickly. I do use German more often than English, especially in my current
    company, which pushed me to practice.
  sec: 2999
  time: '49:59'
  who: Xia
- line: We didn’t cover inclusion and mentorship. You have experience as a mom of
    two. Do you mentor other women in similar situations?
  sec: 3035
  time: '50:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I had to figure out most things on my own. My husband didn’t know anything
    about data, and I had no network. Now, with a little free time, I give back. Many
    women I know in Germany stay at home, even with master’s or PhD degrees. I find
    that unfortunate.
  sec: 3066
  time: '51:06'
  who: Xia
- line: Do you think this is cultural?
  sec: 3144
  time: '52:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, partly. In China, couples often need both people working full-time. In
    Germany, the system allows people to work less because the financial need is lower.
    Married couples have tax incentives, so there’s less pressure to work.
  sec: 3149
  time: '52:29'
  who: Xia
- line: I want to teach my daughter to be herself. It’s especially hard for foreigners
    without much support. That’s why I started a working mom project in my neighborhood.
    We meet in local living rooms, help review CVs, and provide guidance. It’s not
    about doing everything for them, but sharing experiences and encouragement.
  sec: 3241
  time: '54:01'
  who: Xia
- line: 'I went back to university at 30. If I waited until 40, it might have been
    different. Now, I mentor two women: one is a single mom who hasn’t worked for
    five years, and another is a recent graduate struggling to find a first job. I
    want to give back because this journey is challenging, especially for foreign
    women.'
  sec: 3327
  time: '55:27'
  who: Xia
- line: Some women may be less lucky or lack access to these groups. Are there online
    resources or meetups you recommend?
  sec: 3395
  time: '56:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Pi Ladies is a good general group for women. I’ve also engaged with Women
    in Big Data Berlin. There’s a group for freelancers and entrepreneurs called The
    Wounded, which offers mentorship programs. I’m currently mentoring through them
    for three months.
  sec: 3421
  time: '57:01'
  who: Xia
- line: I see a comment from a working mom in a Zoom Camp. She asks about non-technical
    backgrounds, like applied linguistics.
  sec: 3487
  time: '58:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s about finding your passion and strengths, not just following trends.
    Your background is always helpful. For example, someone with import/export experience
    applying for a data scientist role in that domain has an advantage. My technical
    background in Java helped me compared to most new data scientists. Even non-technical
    backgrounds can be leveraged in relevant domains.
  sec: 3517
  time: '58:37'
  who: Xia
- line: Thanks for sharing your story.
  sec: 3634
  time: '1:00:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks for sharing your story as a working mom with a linguistics background.
    I hope things work out.
  sec: 3642
  time: '1:00:42'
  who: Xia
- line: It’s been a pleasure. Before this podcast, we interacted online. Thank you
    for sharing your story. If anyone else wants to share, please reach out—it motivates
    current and future students.
  sec: 3655
  time: '1:00:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you.
  sec: 3700
  time: '1:01:40'
  who: Xia
- line: Have a nice day. Being Head of Data is not just budget planning, but also
    strategic work with interesting projects.
  sec: 3708
  time: '1:01:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I’ll try. Have a nice day, and goodbye everyone.
  sec: 3719
