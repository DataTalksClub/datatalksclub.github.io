description: 'Master actionable data strategy, DataOps & GPT: learn to pitch small AI use cases, set baselines, apply CI/CD and deliver measurable AI-powered products.'
intro: How do you turn AI ambitions into measurable, deliverable data products? In this episode Boyan Angelov — author of Elements of Data Strategy and leader of data strategy at Exxeta AG — walks through practical steps to make data strategy actionable for AI-powered products. Drawing on a decade across bioinformatics, clinical trials, HRTech, LegalTech and consulting, Boyan reframes data strategy as a flexible, outcome-focused plan and explains the due diligence needed to align business goals with feasible use cases. <br><br> Topics covered include use case ideation, feasibility and prioritization, managing influence cascades and scope creep, impact assessment and portfolio management, and delivery practices. We dig into DataOps principles — lean, agile and CI/CD for data — and clarify platform, AI and BI roles and the core skills required for strategists. Boyan also shows how GPT and ChatGPT can be used as a writing co-pilot for outlines, pitches and technical guidance, and recommends starting small with budgeted use cases plus baseline and post-implementation metrics to measure success. <br><br> Listen to get concrete guidance on pitching, measuring and operationalizing a data strategy for AI-powered products — including practical DataOps and GPT workflows you can apply right away

- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: Guest Introduction & Current Role
- line: This week, we'll talk about data strategy. We have a special guest today,
    Boyan. Boyan is a data strategist with a decade of experience in various academic
    and commercial environments such as bioinformatics, clinical trials, HR tech,
    legal tech, and management consulting. He's the author of two books, one of which
    is Elements of Data Strategy and the other being Python and R for the Modern Data
    Scientist.
  sec: 113
  time: '1:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Currently, he is leading the data strategy function at Exxeta, AG, which is
    a large technology company that focuses on the German-speaking region of the world.
    He also runs a digital transformation consultancy. Welcome, Boyan!
  sec: 113
  time: '1:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hello, I'm glad to be here. Glad to talk about data strategy – my favorite
    topic.
  sec: 158
  time: '2:38'
  who: Boyan
- line: As usual, the questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer.
    Thanks, Johanna, for your help. Now let's start.
  sec: 163
  time: '2:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: Guest Background & Career Path
- line: Before we go into our main topic of data strategy design, let's start with
    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 170
  time: '2:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think that's a favorite question. My career, I think, took me to quite
    many different places. I think, especially for your audience, it's interesting
    to hear because I was a data scientist before there was such a thing, I would
    say. It was right on the edge of that. I actually studied biochemistry, specifically
    cell biology. After this, completely by accident, I started to do a Master's thesis,
    which was a bit more computational. This way, I started to code. Around that time
    I wondered, “What should I do with my life?” and being able to code, knowing computer
    statistics. Then I heard that in the US, they have this title of “data scientist,”
    so I thought “Let me try Germany.” Because I studied in Germany, normally, people
    really care about your background. I was very lucky that the startups didn't.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 179
  time: '2:59'
  who: Boyan
- line: The startups looked at me and said, “Yeah, actually, if you can code and if
    you know things about data, you can be a data scientist.” I got the title, I got
    the job, and I spent the first half of my career being a data scientist for all
    those kinds of different startups, mostly. That was fun. I learned a lot. I also
    learned how not to do things, which I think is also useful. Kind of towards the
    end of the second half of my career, it was a bit like I had another accident
    happen to me. I saw myself as more of an introverted person and going into consulting
    wasn't an obvious thing for me, to be honest, but I tried and I loved it. There
    I got the very strange title of data strategist, which even at the time people
    didn't understand. Now, I think there's still a lot of work to be done there.
    Hopefully, I can help a bit to do that today.
  sec: 179
  time: '2:59'
  who: Boyan
- line: I spent some years there. I did a data strategy for somebody (for a company)
    and they invited me to be the CTO after that. It was a funny thing because it
    shows you that if you do data strategy, then you can easily transition to a different
    role. Also, we have a saying in Bulgarian that means “You have to eat the soup
    that you cooked.” It was funny, because I had to make the data strategy, and then
    I had to go and implement it. Of course, it's very challenging, so we can talk
    about this today as well. So I was the CTO of this company that was more focused
    on data business. That was really obvious that a data strategist would fit.
  sec: 179
  time: '2:59'
  who: Boyan
- line: At some point, though, we weren't successful – unfortunately, that's how many
    startups are. I really wanted to go back to consulting. This is around the time
    when I finished my second book, which was about data strategy, and I thought,
    “Okay, now I really have unfinished business there.” This is why I'm back in consulting
    at Exxeta, where, as you said, I lead the data strategy function here and work
    with all kinds of clients on the topic. It is by far my favorite topic – data
    strategy.
  sec: 179
  time: '2:59'
  who: Boyan
- header: 'Becoming a Data Strategist: Accidental Transition'
- line: So how did it happen that you were called a data strategist? You said that
    (or maybe my impression was) that it happened kind of by accident?
  sec: 347
  time: '5:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I went into consulting by accident. At that company, they had data strategist
    as a title. When I looked at it at first, I thought, “Well, okay. That's interesting.
    I'm a data scientist. Is this something for me or not?” At that point, I started
    to realize, “Actually, I am comfortable and enjoy the things around data science.”
    So I thought, “Let me try this out.” There were a lot of unfamiliar words, to
    be honest. This is the reason why I wrote the second book, because I got the title
    and I started to ask, “Yeah, what do I do now as a data strategist?” [chuckles]
  sec: 356
  time: '5:56'
  who: Boyan
- line: You get the requirements from your company, which is something like, “Make
    the data project successful. Go have fun.” Which is everything without the coding
    part. That was challenging. The role wasn't super-defined. It was kind of this
    “Purple People” as you often call them. There was a mention of that. I heard this
    term before. There was an article, I think, from DVC (data versioning tool). One
    of the people there mentioned that they're these “purple people”. I don't know
    why that's the name, but these are people who are kind of in between technology
    and business.
  sec: 356
  time: '5:56'
  who: Boyan
- line: Like product managers, right?
  sec: 434
  time: '7:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, kind of. Like data product managers. When I wrote my book, I asked the
    question, “What do you call such people? Is data strategist the right title?”
    And I haven't found a better one. I think it's cool to say data product manager.
    I think that kind of feels right. Because actually, data strategy is not all we
    do. That's the conclusion that most people come to. They think all we do is data
    strategy, while 80% of the work is actually implementing a strategy. [chuckles]
    But it doesn't come from the title. So that's how it happened.
  sec: 435
  time: '7:15'
  who: Boyan
- line: That's how I became a data strategist.  I became a data strategist, but the
    skills weren't defined. It was really a situation where the requirement was “Get
    value from data without coding,” basically. I had to find my way and this is actually
    why I wrote the book, to try to define it a bit. I actually did this Venn diagram
    of skills. You know the data science Venn diagram, right? That was the original
    thing. In data science, we had the same thing, if you remember. Many years ago.
  sec: 435
  time: '7:15'
  who: Boyan
- header: 'Defining Data Strategy: Actionable, Flexible Plans'
- line: Yes, I do. So, data strategy is getting value from data without coding, right?
    [Boyan chuckles] Can you give a more precise definition? What is a data strategy?
  sec: 493
  time: '8:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: A data strategy is technically a plan to get value from data. This plan has
    to be actionable, and it has to be flexible enough to be changed when in operation.
    This plan has to contain a lot of information. I think you often see on LinkedIn
    when people say “data strategy,” and you have a list of goals. A list of goals
    is not a strategy. This always obsessed me when I saw that. Strategy is normally
    a very big document. That's actually a dangerous thing. But in this document,
    what do you... I can talk about the phases because the book explains the process
    of doing data strategy in phases. But one important thing to say here is a strategy
    cannot be static. That's a big mistake.
  sec: 507
  time: '8:27'
  who: Boyan
- line: You have some kind of plans for your data teams, for your data products/projects,
    and then things don't work out. This is a very typical scenario. Somebody creates
    a data strategy and nothing happens. So I'm very focused on making a data strategy
    that is flexible and iterative. You don't make a static document at the beginning.
    Normally, it's a deck, actually. You have to really be able to change this. There
    are a lot of artifacts that are actually connected to that deck. I can give you
    one example – a data dictionary, for example, would be a part of the due diligence
    of a data strategy. You can imagine this deck, and you have a big conference page,
    which contains a dictionary of the data associated with use cases. This is just
    an example of how specific you can get.
  sec: 507
  time: '8:27'
  who: Boyan
- header: Due Diligence & Aligning Business Goals
- line: It's still a bit abstract to me. Okay, we have a deck, which is connected
    to strategy. I know that strategy is a big document. It can't be static. Then
    there are some other artifacts like a data dictionary. But maybe you have a more
    concrete example? What exactly is in this deck?
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Maybe I can go into the process of data strategy. You can't tell a company
    what to do if you don't know where they are. That is a classic mistake. You hire
    somebody to give you a plan, but you can't make a plan if you don't know what's
    there already. This is a very classic example, especially in big companies. You
    have to spend a lot of time at the beginning figuring things out. As you know,
    when you do data science – let's say a machine learning project – you can't just
    say, “Yeah, we need to make a churn model,” and then wait for success. It doesn't
    work this way. You have to see what data you have first. That's the most important
    thing.
  sec: 631
  time: '10:31'
  who: Boyan
- line: So that's the due diligence part. That takes a while. The due diligence part
    is not strategizing, it's really mostly about figuring out where the company is.
    First, you have to find out what the goals of the company are. I will have this
    discussion today with my team, actually, “How do you deal with your clients?”
    Because every business has some kind of point, right? It wouldn't be a business
    otherwise. Let's say that you're a company that sells socks (as a basic example)
    and you have a data team. You can imagine that the goal is to sell more socks
    faster. Taking this... [cross-talk]
  sec: 631
  time: '10:31'
  who: Boyan
- line: Sorry for interrupting. So we have a company that sells socks, the goal of
    the company is to sell more socks [cross-talk]
  sec: 707
  time: '11:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: More socks, faster. Let's make it a bit more. [chuckles]
  sec: 715
  time: '11:55'
  who: Boyan
- line: That's clear. We also have a data team in this company, whose goal (because
    they also work at the socks company) is the same goal as the entire company, right?
  sec: 721
  time: '12:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: It should be. But this is where the strategy comes in. Because normally what
    happens in these companies is, the C-level people think “Let's hire a bunch of
    data scientists and tell them 'help us sell more socks faster, at a better price.'”
    That's literally how it is, actually. The data scientists are then like, “Yeah,
    but the data and this and that and that. We need data engineers. We need some
    kind of cloud platform. We need a budget for this. What type of skills do we need?”
    This becomes a mess very quickly. This is really what's happened in Germany. After
    this, companies realized “Oh! We do need data engineers as well!” Because somebody
    needs to make the data available and somebody needs to set up the infrastructure.
  sec: 730
  time: '12:10'
  who: Boyan
- line: And now what happens is, companies realize “Oh! We need data strategists as
    well.” Because somebody needs to see, “How do you go from selling more socks faster?”
    To, “Actually, if you do a churn model for a socks customer, that somehow contributes
    to that goal.” And this translation of how the more technical impact contributes
    to the business one – that's very hard. It's really hard to find the right thing
    to do. So that's that part.
  sec: 730
  time: '12:10'
  who: Boyan
- header: 'Designing Strategy: Use Case Ideation, Feasibility & Prioritization'
- line: I think I understand, more or less, but I'm still a bit confused. So let's
    say we have a goal – to sell more socks faster. What exactly goes into the strategy?
    Because to implement this model, we need to have the data infrastructure, the
    actual data, the data engineers, we need to have the platform, we need to know
    who to hire, etc. Does this go into the deck with a strategy?
  sec: 808
  time: '13:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, correct. I think I have to jump a bit forward and then go back again
    because now we're going into the design phase. Let's say that during the due diligence,
    you found out what use cases there are, whether they have a cloud environment,
    what the data looks like, what type of people there are, etc. This is seeing what's
    there. Let's say you know where the company is and what there is. Now we have
    to design the strategy. The first thing you do is use case ideation. You basically
    take a look at what use cases are possible. I mentioned the churn model. That's
    one use case. But maybe you can make some kind of recommendation engine for the
    online shop to sell socks. That's another use case.
  sec: 837
  time: '13:57'
  who: Boyan
- line: You can probably find 10-15 for any business. So that's the easy part. [chuckles]
    Because to come up with ideas, you do need to have some experience. Again, this
    is actually the data strategist's work. You do need to have seen many use cases.
    But then, what becomes very hard... ChatGPT can actually help you a lot here –
    you could technically ask, “What are the use cases of selling socks”. That example
    may be stupid, but you can also say “What are the use cases of selling flowers,
    (or chairs)?” [chuckles] “How do we use data science to sell chairs?” And you
    can get a lot of nice ideas from that. But here comes the hard part (and explains
    why a data strategy needs to understand technical things) and that's the feasibility
    part. It's easy to come up with ideas, but understanding what's feasible is very
    hard. Here, you take the results from the first phase (due diligence), you look
    at them, because you now know what data there is, what the skills of the people
    are – you know all of this. We can say, “For the recommendation engine, we have
    the right people, we have the right data, we have the right infrastructure. Let's
    do it.”
  sec: 837
  time: '13:57'
  who: Boyan
- line: There, you have the prioritization part as well. Because then you need to
    see, “Okay, do you make a recommendation engine for the online shop for socks,
    how important is this?” Then you take the feasibility, the importance, the business
    impact, and then you prioritize. That's a bit easier, normally, but again, here,
    the hard part is actually the technical understanding. This is what most companies
    still mess up. You create some ideas, you create a strategy, and then when the
    people start to implement them, it's not feasible. It is very hard to know what's
    feasible or not.
  sec: 837
  time: '13:57'
  who: Boyan
- line: And for that, you really need to know what's there – what kind of data and
    all these things.
  sec: 977
  time: '16:17'
  who: Alexey
- header: Influence Cascade & Scope Creep in Data Products
- line: Yeah. This process – ideation, feasibility, and prioritization – this triad
    is the standard thing. To be honest, after this, you do need to do several other
    things that come into the data strategy. You have to set up the target architecture
    and technology. Let's say that now we know what the use cases are. Here, there's
    something I want to talk a bit about. It has the fancy name, “influence cascade”.
    I'll give you a concrete example. Let's say we have a churn model, and we use
    tabular data for that – very standard numerical stuff. We build the whole build
    API, we build the whole product, and it's done.
  sec: 981
  time: '16:21'
  who: Boyan
- line: Then, for whatever reason, it's not very successful – because we didn't take
    the right data, the right people weren't involved, we didn't know how to measure
    this, whatever – there are so many reasons why it may not be successful. Then
    you have to go back. Let's say, we take text data – this “scope creep” in data
    products happens all the time, but if you take text data, suddenly you have other
    problems. That's why it's called “cascading” – the product people often think
    “A small change here. What's the big deal? It's just another dataset?” Oh, no.
    Now you do need more storage – maybe the data is PDF. [chuckles] You suddenly
    need NLP people. And then the whole thing breaks down straight from the beginning.
  sec: 981
  time: '16:21'
  who: Boyan
- line: This is why you do the use case stuff first, and then you do target architecture,
    because if you change the use case, you change everything. That's why that's the
    first step. But this is the design process. There are a few other steps there
    like data governance and the operating model, which are a bit more standard. The
    operating model is basically how people operate, “Do you set up a hybrid team?
    Do you set up a centralized “Center of Excellence” team?” All of that.
  sec: 981
  time: '16:21'
  who: Boyan
- header: Impact Assessment, Portfolio Management & Delivery
- line: 'So the goal of this deck (of having this data strategy), or the output from
    the data strategist is: join a company, first understand what is there, then come
    up with some cases, come up with this targeted architecture and all these things,
    like designing this thing, thinking about data governance (the structure of the
    people), operating mode. So we have this deck. What happens next?'
  sec: 1102
  time: '18:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: That is the million-dollar question. Because even if you create a great data
    strategy, you have the right use cases, the right people, and everything is correct
    – it is static, while the world is very complex. By having such a deck, you have
    already fixed a lot of problems that would happen anyway. People are supposedly
    going to work on the right things – the right people at the right time. You have
    a roadmap as well (I forgot to mention this). You're ready to start working. But
    this is the whole third part of the book, actually, of my process, which is delivery.
    I'll be honest with you, this is the hardest part. I personally cannot figure
    this out completely because this is where you face reality. There are three elements
    here that I have added in my model. One is impact assessment. Another one is portfolio
    management. And the third one is DataOps.
  sec: 1136
  time: '18:56'
  who: Boyan
- line: Let's start with the first ones, because they're less controversial – impact
    assessment. You do need to set up some kind of a baseline. Let's take the socks
    again. Let's say you have a data strategy – you're in the sock-selling business.
    Remember the initial goal, selling more socks faster. [chuckles] That should be
    measurable with any good business. Unfortunately, often it's not, but let's assume
    it is. Let's say the business unit measures that. It's a big assumption, honestly,
    for many companies, but let's say they do measure that. Then you really have to
    have a good look at your data team from time to time. Really, every several months
    you need to take a look at your churn model, the recommendation – there are four
    or five use cases that are now being worked on and deployed. Does it move the
    needle somewhere? That's very hard.
  sec: 1136
  time: '18:56'
  who: Boyan
- line: But you do need to have these check-ins, because then you can adjust. Let's
    say, people spend a lot of time on the churn model, and then you see that it does
    improve the selling of socks because fewer customers churn, but it's hard to measure.
    Here, you can have a lot of statistics, A/B testing and all of those things you
    can do. But the price of us maintaining this is not worth it, so we have to refocus
    on something else. Therefore, we completely scrap that use case, even the part
    of the architecture moved to something else. This is probably the result from
    the impact assessment.
  sec: 1136
  time: '18:56'
  who: Boyan
- line: Do you actually do this after it's implemented? Let's say we implemented this
    churn model. We ran it, we did the A/B test, and we see that there is a positive
    impact. But then we also did some calculations and saw that the cost of having
    this architecture is outrageous. It's just too large. It's not worth the impact
    it gives us, right? Then we say “Okay, let's scrap it.”
  sec: 1279
  time: '21:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. This is the portfolio management part. You have several use cases –
    that's the hard thing. You have to take a look at all of them at the same time.
    It's a qualitative measure, unfortunately, I think. There are hidden costs – supporting
    the teams is expensive and other things. You can do it, obviously, immediately
    after the start. But for most data projects you can do a pilot in a matter of
    weeks and then you can start measuring. But you do need a baseline because what
    happens is (people forget about this) if you don't have a baseline or you just
    start working on it – you didn't set up some kind of metric at the beginning.
    You think, “Okay, let's see. We're going to see the results.” You get the result
    at the end.
  sec: 1302
  time: '21:42'
  who: Boyan
- line: At some point, you measure the churn rate, but you didn't know what the churn
    rate was at the beginning. So you go to the business owners and tell them, “Yeah,
    we did this.” And they say, “So how bad is the situation compared to before?”
    So you have to set this up at the beginning, which is really something that is
    very easy to forget. Before the project, you need to look at the business metric
    and say, “That's the number.” And then two months later, you can really say “Yeah,
    we improved this by 2%.” Here, the hard part comes as, “Which business unit contributed
    the most to this?” But at least you have some kind of a start.
  sec: 1302
  time: '21:42'
  who: Boyan

- header: Data- and AI-Powered Products Defined
- header: 'DataOps Principles: Lean, Agile & CI/CD Practices'
- line: Yeah. [chuckles] And DataOps, maybe we can talk about this as well, because
    this is very... [chuckles] I think it's controversial, because when people hear
    the term “data product,” people think that about a data product – Data Mesh is
    defined in one way, people think about the data assets. So there are very different
    things. What I mean by DataOps...
  sec: 1568
  time: '26:08'
  who: Boyan
- line: Maybe we can start with the data product, because this is what data strategy
    is about, right?
  sec: 1410
  time: '23:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: About data products? [chuckles] Yeah. I did change my mind on this one. I
    wrote about data products, but to be honest, it should be data- and AI-powered
    products. A data product is something else. A data product should be just data.
    I made a bit of a circle and I just joined the Data Mesh definition of that. It's
    just the data itself, without the use case. My view in the book was that a data
    product is the data plus the use case, but I don't want to compete with the more
    popular definition, which is just the data and the architectural components around
    it. It is with the data quantum and the data mesh, where it's a bit bigger. But
    what I talk about is data- and AI-powered products. It's like the API endpoint
    for a machine learning model that predicts churn in Salesforce. That's the data-
    and AI-powered product with an AI feature. When I say “data product,” this is
    what I mean.
  sec: 1417
  time: '23:37'
  who: Boyan
- line: So you have some data and then there is a specific use case on top of this
    data.
  sec: 1477
  time: '24:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's exactly correct. That is the data- and AI-powered product. Technically
    we should say “data- and AI-powered product managers,” but it's a bit of a mouthful.
    But regarding a data product, we should leave it at the data level, without the
    use cases, I think.
  sec: 1482
  time: '24:42'
  who: Boyan
- line: Now let's talk about DataOps. But then there is also an interesting question
    that I want to ask you later.
  sec: 1497
  time: '24:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: DataOps is a tricky, tricky term. People mean different things when they say
    it. Again, in the book, it's a combination between Agile and Lean – it's just
    the methodology with a CI/CD angle to it. To be honest, there are a lot of ideas
    there. There's one book recommendation I have that I'll give at the end as well.
    The book is called Practical DataOps. The idea is – I mentioned Lean and Agile.
    “Does Agile work in data science?” is my favorite question. The short answer is
    “It doesn't.” [chuckles] But maybe it's like democracy – not great, but it's the
    best we've got, you could say. But Agile in data – in the book, I have these interviews
    with practical data leaders and they all said, “Yeah, you can do Agile within
    a software.” We have to be careful about requirements, because it's very hard
    to measure certain things, especially at the beginning.
  sec: 1503
  time: '25:03'
  who: Boyan
- line: I will leave the Agile topic a bit because the Lean part is what's fascinating.
    And that book, Harvinder Atwal is one of my favorite authors. That book is brilliant.
    He took the ideas from Lean manufacturing (cars and conveyor belts) to data. The
    focus there is not on doing the right things, but avoiding the wrong things. This
    is so amazing in data science engineering, because it's hard to know what the
    right thing is. But everybody knows the wrong thing. Basically, he focuses on
    how data people waste their time and energy and literally how much time data scientists
    spend waiting – really concrete, measurable things and just avoiding them. That's
    brilliant, I think. It's a brilliant way to manage data projects. You don't focus
    on what's good, you focus on what's bad.
  sec: 1503
  time: '25:03'
  who: Boyan
- line: By the way, I think we have two podcast episodes about DataOps, so you can
    check them out for more details.
  sec: 1627
  time: '27:07'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Strategy Roles: Platform, AI and BI Distinctions'
- line: The question I see is quite an interesting one, because I also wanted to ask
    you, “What is the difference between a data strategist and a data science strategist?”
    What you describe, to me, is really data science-centric, but data is not just
    about data science, right? We have use cases, we have dashboards, etc.
  sec: 1638
  time: '27:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. There's the idea (and some very nice articles) about how data strategy
    is going to split into flavors. “Data strategist” is a more general flavor. You
    could have an AI strategy, which is somebody who focuses on just that part. A
    data strategist is just the more general idea. Because then you have data platforms,
    data engineering – it also has value. It's a bit harder to measure the success
    of those, because they're kind of  enablers, indirectly.
  sec: 1663
  time: '27:43'
  who: Boyan
- line: There's this hierarchy of data science needs model from Shopify, where you
    have the advanced use cases on the top, but you can't get to them if you don't
    have things like a data platform and cloud services infrastructure. The data strategist
    is responsible for that part, too – setting this up. Especially in bigger companies,
    that's a bigger problem. So I will say there's a difference. It's just the more
    general one. There's also business intelligence reporting – that's also there.
  sec: 1663
  time: '27:43'
  who: Boyan
- line: It's just a bit more difficult to measure, but I guess we need analytics to
    be able to measure something, right?
  sec: 1725
  time: '28:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sometimes it's a gradient. I do think that we shouldn't try to measure everything.
    It's impossible. You should at least have an idea of where things are going. But
    that's why I like this. A typical example is with these lighthouse projects, when
    the companies want to do something very fancy with AI. Normally, it's actually
    the last thing they should be doing. This idea is from Martin Szugat from Datentreiber,
    who I interviewed for the book. He's a good friend of mine who really has brilliant
    ideas on this. He told me once, about lighthouse projects, that they're really
    the last thing a company should do because usually, it's some very advanced use
    case. It's some kind of NLP, computer vision, deep learning use case, because
    that's what gets the media attention – it's amazing and fancy people like it.
    But to do this, you need crazy architecture, crazy skills, crazy everything to
    move beyond the pilot. What you should do instead is get the most boring use cases,
    like reporting, automation of reporting, etc. [chuckles] Get it done, show the
    number, get the money from the business owners, and then do the more advanced
    things. That's his idea, not mine, but it's a brilliant one.
  sec: 1733
  time: '28:53'
  who: Boyan
- header: 'Core Skills: Data Knowledge, Communication & Systems Thinking'
- line: Let's come back to the time when you were hired as a data strategist. As I
    understood, your background was data science? [Boyan confirms] What skills did
    you need back then to actually be able to do this role? What kind of skills did
    you need to show that you have and what kind of skills did you need to develop
    when you joined?
  sec: 1802
  time: '30:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: For this, I can refer to the Venn diagram. There's an exercise I did with
    my colleagues back then, because not just me, but the other data strategist –
    we all had the same question, “What skills do we have?” We had some people who
    were business people – completely business – people who just never [inaudible]
    and they are also data strategists. That's why you should have different flavors.
    I group it into three groups. Imagine a Venn diagram with three circles, where
    you have data, and you have communication systems thinking. Data is the whole
    tech thing. It's data science, engineering, analytics, cloud, and communication.
    Everybody will tell you that the last one is the skill. And it is the skill –
    Can you write? Can you talk? Can you explain? Can you translate? This is the hardest
    skill.
  sec: 1821
  time: '30:21'
  who: Boyan
- line: The ultimate data strategist skill is translation. That's why at McKinsey
    they call analytics translators, which I like as a title. It doesn't sound as
    cool, I think, as a strategist, but you do need to translate from the requirements
    “sell more socks” to “churn model” and beyond. You have to operate on very different
    levels. Systems thinking, this is the most abstract thing, which many people would
    roll their eyes at when they hear this, because it sounds like a management consulting
    thing. In the book, I describe it a bit more, but I'll give you an example.
  sec: 1821
  time: '30:21'
  who: Boyan
- line: A typical day of mine is when I have to explain what AI is [chuckles] and
    all in the same day, I have to look at access permissions on Azure and explain
    how to do that part – in the same day. That's the hardest part about the job because
    you have to move between those two levels. I don't think you can have a junior
    data strategist, almost, because it's something you need to get from those different
    domains. But you do have the flavors of people.
  sec: 1821
  time: '30:21'
  who: Boyan
- line: Do you think it's important to have these technical skills, like explaining
    roles in Azure?
  sec: 1944
  time: '32:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is kind of an example I sometimes give in terms of understanding (let's
    use a data science example) something like support vector machines. Let's take
    that one. Most people wouldn't understand the math behind it, but if you go on
    Wikipedia and look at their nice diagram of separation of classes, where you have
    the decision boundaries. You read the Wikipedia article and you see “Oh, well,
    there's this kernel tricky thing. There's this trick to maximize this boundary.”
    Do you understand how support for vector machines works? No, you have no idea.
    You can't code it yourself. But you understand it conceptually, kind of.
  sec: 1951
  time: '32:31'
  who: Boyan
- line: This is the same level you need to be a data strategist. You need these concepts
    of architecture and you need to understand what access is, what pipelines are,
    what orchestration is, etc. You really do need to understand this. It's hard for
    me to say – I come from a technical background. But that was as a biologist. Yeah,
    you do need to have conceptual knowledge of everything in data, for sure. I think
    otherwise, it's very hard.
  sec: 1951
  time: '32:31'
  who: Boyan
- line: But you don't have to be an expert in things like orchestration or Azure?
  sec: 2014
  time: '33:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. It is frustrating. On a personal level, I can tell what's frustrating
    about this, because everybody now is going to think “Let me become a data strategist.
    It's all roses and unicorns,” You will feel stupid all the time. You will be talking
    to people who have 20 years of experience in data architecture in the same day
    with people who have 20 years of experience in sales and business. And with both
    groups, you feel stupid, because you're this weird jack of all trades that kind
    of knows a bit of everything, and you will be judged from those two groups on
    their level. So you have to prepare yourself mentally for that. But on the plus
    side, you get to do many different things, which is totally worth it, I would
    say.
  sec: 2018
  time: '33:38'
  who: Boyan
- line: Okay. So again, the skills you need are mostly communication skills – you
    need to be able to write, read, communicate, and translate, right? Then you also
    need to have some technical skills. You don't need to be an expert, but you need
    to know what a data pipeline is, what an orchestrator is – all these technical
    terms.
  sec: 2057
  time: '34:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Somebody will need to implement this, so you need to know exactly what it
    is and how much is required for that, or you may even need to know which tool
    is going to be used. For example, “If we are building a data pipeline, we will
    use this particular tool.” Right?
  sec: 2057
  time: '34:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: At that point, you can get advice, I think. For example, with orchestration
    – Airflow versus something else – the second part, you don't need to know, I think,
    because tools change every day. But you do need to know how to orchestrate some
    scripts and what that looks like, and then you find a more competent person to
    help you there.
  sec: 2101
  time: '35:01'
  who: Boyan

  sec: 2120

  sec: 2124

    architecture, right?
  sec: 2127
  time: '35:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Everywhere you have somebody working with you. On the business side, you will
    also have somebody that will work with you – on every other side. It's a role
    where if you're alone, it's totally pointless. This role is only an enabler. It's
    completely pointless without other people.
  sec: 2136
  time: '35:36'
  who: Boyan
- line: Does this mean that a company that wants to hire a data strategist already
    needs to have all these people in place, before they hire a data strategist? Or
    does a data strategist come with a team? [chuckles]
  sec: 2150
  time: '35:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] It''s hard to say. If you''re a smaller company that''s just starting
    out, you do need a data strategist, but they would be called a CTO, Chief Data
    Officer, or Head of Data. I think a Head of Data Science has to be a data strategist.
    A Team Lead of Data Science has to be a bit of a data strategist. This is kind
    of a more managerial role. A Team Lead has to be a data strategist, actually.
    And you do need to hire them at the start to know what you''re gonna do, I think.'
  sec: 2167

  who: Boyan
- header: 'Path to Data Strategist: Business Fluency & Deliberate Practice'
- line: Okay. Let's say I work as a Senior Data Scientist. I listen to this podcast
    episode and I think, “Okay, this is so cool. I want to be a Data Strategist.”
    How do I go about that?
  sec: 2195
  time: '36:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: You have to learn a lot of business. You really have to learn a lot of business.
    And you have to let go of a lot of things. You have to start to understand that...
    Because, as I said, you will feel stupid. This will be new to you. And if you're
    a Senior Data Scientist, at that point in your career, your ego is already high.
    You likely think, “Okay, I have learned so much that I can do anything.” Well,
    now you start from scratch because you suddenly have to understand how businesses
    work. It's easy to underestimate, but you do need to start from the beginning.
  sec: 2208
  time: '36:48'
  who: Boyan
- line: First, understand how businesses work – talk to the functional leadership
    in your company, meaning the Head of Marketing. Go to them and ask them, “How
    can data help you?” This is the first start because then you start to understand
    what they want. Try to align your churn model to the socks selling, right? [chuckles]
    Talk to the people who sell the socks. You work in that area. Of course, I will
    say to get the book. The book won't make you a data strategist, but it will give
    you the typical things that you need to do – the activities. But you have to go
    and actually do the work. You have to be comfortable stopping being a data scientist
    because you will work with very vague things. Normally, these are uncomfortable
    for technical people who want to be specific, I would say.
  sec: 2208
  time: '36:48'
  who: Boyan
- line: The worst of it is, you have to work on different levels in the same day.
    This is also what's going to happen if you transition to that. Because as I said,
    in the morning, you're talking about business, and then you have to write some
    Python in the afternoon. That becomes a problem very fast, I would say.
  sec: 2208
  time: '36:48'
  who: Boyan
- line: Why?
  sec: 2316
  time: '38:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think because of the focus you need to prepare different things in the same
    day. If it's in several different days, I think it's great, because your brain
    is active on many different levels. But in the same day, personally, for me, it
    was always challenging to switch the focus that fast. Because when I think about
    business, I think in an abstract way. I also get interrupted operationally. But
    if you have to write code in the same day, I think it's a challenge. But between
    the days it's amazing. If you can be a data strategist for two days, and three
    days a data scientist, maybe that's a good idea.
  sec: 2318
  time: '38:38'
  who: Boyan
- header: 'Translation Skill: Explaining Use Cases to Stakeholders'
- line: Coming back to your point of learning more about the business (or learning
    a lot about business). You mentioned that you need to talk to functional leaders,
    such as the head of marketing, the head of product, maybe – all the people who
    do something. You come to them and say, “How can they help you?” But they have
    no idea and think, “Who is this person?” So how can you make it clear what exactly
    you can help them with?
  sec: 2349
  time: '39:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, then just ask them what they do and then comes the understanding. You
    ask them what they do – they sell socks. They start talking about customers and
    then you get this idea, “All right, maybe we can do a customer segmentation model.”
    You have to read about the use cases in your area, which is easy. If you're in
    a standard area, it's easy. It's hard if you do something very specific. But then,
    if you think about use cases and already prepare before those meetings, then you
    can give them those ideas. They will ask you, “Okay, tell me what a customer segmentation
    model is.” And you have to be able to translate that.
  sec: 2376
  time: '39:36'
  who: Boyan
- line: You will mess it up the first time. [laughs] Because just by saying “customer
    segmentation model,” you already messed up. You should say, “Yeah, we have this
    way of separating the target groups and we can identify them.” If you say this,
    there you go. But trust me, the moment you say something and you feel smart, they
    feel not so smart and they don't understand. This, actually, is the biggest challenge
    – communication.
  sec: 2376
  time: '39:36'
  who: Boyan
- line: Okay. And the only way to learn this is by doing it, right?
  sec: 2439
  time: '40:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, the only way. It's like how people should learn to play guitar – you
    can just play the guitar, but you have to have deliberate practice. You have to
    do it deliberately and put yourself in uncomfortable positions. You have to translate.
    You really have to deliberately learn and it's not easy, but the results are amazing.
    To be honest, yes it's hard, but on the plus side, you will be very active in
    supporting the business. You work on many different projects and many different
    things. Your brain will always be excited about new things – new technologies.
    As I said, this is a gateway to other positions. I became a CTO after that, for
    example.

    you?
  sec: 2491
  time: '41:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: They really liked the data strategy. That was the biggest compliment to me.
    If you like the data strategy – and it was just a data strategy, it was not a
    technology strategy. I had to do the technology after that. That's very different.
    But they liked my approach. They liked that it was concrete. They liked these
    translation skills. These translation skills are the hardest thing in technology.
    I think with the GPT stuff coming up, where do we go to escape from that? And
    I will say, we should go to those middle translating positions, because that is
    very hard, I think. Very few people can do this, I think – translate. That was
    very attractive to them, because as a CTO, that's what you do all day. You translate.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 2496
  time: '41:36'
  who: Boyan

    it was different from being a data strategist?
  sec: 2541
  time: '42:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: The skills... the responsibility is much higher as a data strategist, of course.
    That's a bit obvious. As a data strategist, you're in your data corner, and it's
    kind of a consulting role. That's another thing for people transitioning to that
    – you're an in-house consultant, basically. You can see yourself in that way.
    It becomes different when you are an owner, and you own the whole topic. Because,
    suddenly, it becomes very operational. Everything you do becomes very operational,
    you kind of immediately suffer the results of your mistakes. I had to learn even
    more about the business, obviously.

  who: Boyan
- line: I knew some things, but I had to learn even more. I had to learn accounting.
    [chuckles] You have to learn budgeting much more. There's a lot of management,
    of course. It is a very, very different role. But being a data strategist helped
    me prepare because my ego was ready. I was comfortable not knowing. So when I
    needed to do budgets, hire or fire people, I felt like, “Okay, I can handle this
    somehow.” Because as a data strategist, you already feel a bit weird – you don't
    know different things already. Then you can transition to do something totally
    different.

- line: Interesting. Then there's something I really wanted to talk to you about.
    For your book, you used GPT, and that's really nice that you explicitly acknowledge
    that.
  sec: 2626
  time: '43:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, that's necessary.
  sec: 2641
  time: '44:01'
  who: Boyan
- line: That's necessary, but also like I'm just thinking, like “Would I feel comfortable
    saying that all the content I write is generated by ChatGPT”? I don't know. Okay,
    but this is necessary and I wanted to talk to you about that. How did it actually
    happen? How did you organize this process? How did you use GPT in the book?
  sec: 2644
  time: '44:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are different things and I will link to somebody else who did something
    even next level to that. So, it was at the beginning of this whole craze, while
    I just used it in several areas, only in the sidebar. For example, at some point,
    I need to explain what mittelstand is in Germany, which are the small/medium-sized
    companies that carry the economy. When I was writing the book, I wanted to write
    about strategy systems and thought, “I don't want to go to Wikipedia or wherever
    to find a definition and paraphrase it. This is totally a complete waste of time
    and energy. Absolutely pointless. Zero creativity in doing that – to write the
    definition of mittelstand in a smart way. No.” So that's why I have these sidebars
    – only there. To be honest, you really have to say that you did that, because
    it's very obvious. I think as time goes on, it's not gonna be so obvious.
  sec: 2667
  time: '44:27'
  who: Boyan
- line: I used it just for the sidebars. I have this robot icon there. And for really
    boring things, which I think otherwise you just have to paraphrase. This is what
    it's very good at. But ethically, somebody has to write original content to train
    those models. Because we stopped feeding Stack Overflow. I don't remember the
    last time I was there. Down the line, it's gonna stop feeding the generative AI
    models. If nobody produces original ideas, we're gonna have a delayed problem
    later. That's the big ethical, number one problem of this whole technology.
  sec: 2667
  time: '44:27'
  who: Boyan
- line: The thing is that when we stop generating unique content... you can argue
    for the uniqueness of GPT mapping between ideas, which I do use in my daily work,
    as I mentioned. Let's say I want to find use cases in weird areas, maybe something
    like a government agency that cleans the city. How do you do data science for
    them? Instead of me spending one hour, I will just ask ChatGPT “Give me five use
    cases,” and then I go deeper. For this type of stuff, yeah. But I think really
    original things, we're a bit far off from there. My biggest concern there is the
    ethics of doing that. I can refer to Christoph Molnar, who's really big in the
    Explainable AI field. He recently published an article about how he used it as
    an editor for his book.
  sec: 2667
  time: '44:27'
  who: Boyan
- line: I was going to ask about that, actually.
  sec: 2807
  time: '46:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Ah, okay. I didn't do this. That was before. It was a bit early. Now you can
    do it. I think in the future, I'm open to doing that. I mean, I do use Grammarly,
    for example. You could argue Grammarly is actually pretty intelligent, too. I
    mean, now they also have generative AI features. But you could also argue if you
    use Grammarly, is this ethical or not? So it's a bit of a blurry line there, but
    I think as an editor, as a definition engine – great. But anything else? I just
    don't see it happening yet. But I'm not saying it's not gonna happen. [chuckles]

- line: So one thing I can think of is, for example, say you want to write a chapter.
    For me, I always have this problem of a blank page. How do I start? You can just
    ask GPT or ChatGPT, “I want to write a chapter of a book about this and I need
    you to help me come up with an outline for the chapter. In return, it gives you
    “You need to have these sections and each section should have these subsections.”

  who: Alexey

  sec: 2877
  time: '47:57'
  who: Boyan

    you should cover in this. It's so immensely helpful, provided that it is correct,
    right?
  sec: 2879
  time: '47:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] For sure. I do write a lot – a lot of PowerPoint, as you can imagine.
    I have a blank PowerPoint, where you need to say three bullet points on a topic
    – it''s brilliant there as a start. I haven''t seen it yet where you can just
    copy and paste it. There''s a big difference between 3.5 and 4. I have to say
    4 is really getting there and Microsoft Copilot is coming soon. I think in PowerPoint,
    you''re gonna get some really nice new things. It''s as you said, at the beginning,
    as an outlining tool, I think it''s great. But for original thought, we''re a
    bit... I don''t know, it''s gonna be a very scary time.'
  sec: 2891
  time: '48:11'
  who: Boyan
- line: Yeah, but for a technical book, how original do you need to be?
  sec: 2927
  time: '48:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's true. For a very technical book, if you want to explain it, yeah. Because
    at the end of the day, there's a philosophical argument, “Would you buy a book
    which is written just by that? A purely software-created one?” You should, because
    a technical book is not about convincing you that much. You already bought the
    book about the rest, right? But you do want to learn about the rest. If that's
    the best way to learn it? Come on. I would read it. I wouldn't care. Especially
    if you can't notice the difference in cadence, because you do notice it's a bit
    monotonous. The text is not exciting.
  sec: 2932
  time: '48:52'
  who: Boyan

  who: Alexey

  sec: 2969
  time: '49:29'

  sec: 2972
  time: '49:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's for sure. And the reference. But that's coming, I think, with
    the references. Bing does that a bit as well, so I think that's alright.
  sec: 2975
  time: '49:35'
  who: Boyan
- line: Do you think this is the future of writing books?
  sec: 2985
  time: '49:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Of co-piloting your writing? 100%. Writing them? I don't think so. We're a
    long way from that. Non-technical books, at least. Technical books for sure. [chuckles]
    I think we're gonna have a lot of this. If you just have a manual/tutorial, that's
    different. What is a book then? Then it becomes a tutorial, not a book, arguably
    – philosophically. If it's just a tutorial that's printed, then you can get this.
    I'm not saying it's less valuable, but in a real book, you still need a human
    there as a main pilot, for sure.
  sec: 2989
  time: '49:49'
  who: Boyan
- line: Many people. [Boyan agrees] One person is often not enough to write a book,
    right? [Boyan agrees] You need an editor, proofreader, whatever. By the way, speaking
    about Christopher Molnar, he will do an Ask Me Anything quite soon at DataTalks.Club.
  sec: 3024
  time: '50:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: A brilliant person. He had an article about Explainable AI, and he's done
    so much good work for the field. Brilliant. Underrated. I think people don't know
    enough about his amazing books. He has several really very strange and specific
    books, which every data scientist should read, I would say.

- header: 'ChatGPT for Data Strategy: Ideation, Prompting & Tech Guidance'
- line: Coming back to data strategy. I think you mentioned at some point that it's
    okay to use ChatGPT or GPT-whatever for some things. So how can we use ChatGPT
    for a data strategy design?
  sec: 3062
  time: '51:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is a topic which you do for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks. It's
    not a very concrete thing and at every company it's different. You look at the
    use cases, the architecture, etc. It will help you in the beginning. Let's say,
    on the basic level, you work in a socks company and you ask, “What are the use
    cases for data science in an e-commerce store that sells socks?” And it will give
    you those five or six things. That's the most basic way. Then you become more
    specific, because you know from the due diligence in that company that they use
    Postgres, they have a lot of text data from reviews, they're on Azure, and they
    have a team of those people.
  sec: 3077
  time: '51:17'
  who: Boyan
- line: Then you do some prompt engineering, I would guess and say, “Based on this
    data, how should they transition to this architecture from this one?” Then you
    get some information. It's going to be a good start. It's not going to do the
    work, though. No way. We're very far from there. You just get very basic things
    like, “You need DynamoDB for this. You need this.” But then, if you really are
    going to implement this, then you go to the coding level of ChatGPT. Then it's
    a different story. It's a different thing. You go from strategy to tech. Then
    it's your best friend, because then you can really move very fast and develop
    things. But until that point, it's a bit like brainstorming. It's the same as
    writing a book and outlining things.
  sec: 3077

- header: 'Pitching Strategy: Start Small with a Budgeted Use Case'
- line: Okay, cool. I see that we have a question. “Let's say we have to do a data
    strategy for a consumer B2B2C business with a stakeholder...” That's very specific.
    B2B2C is what? It's a business that sells to a business and then to customers?
  sec: 3164
  time: '52:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, correct.
  sec: 3183
  time: '53:03'
  who: Boyan
- line: Okay, we have that. “There is a stakeholder. With what and where do you start?”
  sec: 3185
  time: '53:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, the first one is always due diligence. Who is the stakeholder? This
    person, what is their background? People forget about this. Who is the audience
    of this? This person maybe understands a ton about technology, and then you're
    gonna change everything in the way you talk to this person. Normally, they don't.
    Normally, this is a business person who is doing this. To approach this, the first
    thing you should do is absolutely zero technical terms. Zero.
  sec: 3194
  time: '53:14'
  who: Boyan
- line: Immediately, you have to show that you understand what the business is doing.
    This doesn't happen in only one meeting. This person has to feel comfortable that
    you, as a data strategist or whatever, know what the business is doing. Otherwise,
    they will destroy you. You're not going to hit the target. You have to be able
    to explain to them what business is about. Sock selling, for example, you have
    to know it almost as well as they do. Not as good, but they will ask you about
    it. Once you show this, then they will listen. That's how humans work.
  sec: 3194
  time: '53:14'
  who: Boyan
- line: When they listen, then you have to come up with a very specific plan, again,
    with zero technical terms. This strategy should be very short – one use case –
    very fast and without risk. You can say “Let's take one data scientist for three
    months and let's do this churn model and see what happens.” So it should be something
    very small and you should be able to feel comfortable talking about budgets. You
    say “The salary of this person, times their three months at 70% capacity. This
    is the money I need. Can you sign?” Give them a chance to just say yes or no.
    You don't want him to think about AI and whatever. You can use the current hype,
    of course, which helps.
  sec: 3194
  time: '53:14'
  who: Boyan
- line: In the end, just give them one small thing. You don't talk about data strategy,
    by the way – no, no, no. If you want to do a data strategy, you don't talk about
    data strategy. Because data strategy sounds very static and very expensive. You
    first focus on, “Let's do a use case. Let's get the value first.” You do a data
    strategy to do the use case, but you focus on value and concrete results with
    a budget. Then you can say “I did the data strategy there.” Then you can move
    on.
  sec: 3194
  time: '53:14'
  who: Boyan
- header: 'Baselines & Measurement: Pre- and Post-Implementation Metrics'
- line: We also have a question about the baseline in data strategy. The question
    is, “Do we need to have two baselines in a strategy? One for the initial discussion
    or initial benchmarking – initial understanding of what the current status is
    – and then the second one for after implementation and actually running the model
    in production.”
  sec: 3332
  time: '55:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it will be hard to come up with the exact same thing that you're trying
    to measure. It depends on what your baseline is. What normally is going to happen
    is – you have some kind of business metric. Let's say it's to reduce customer
    churn. That's very concrete. You can do a churn model. But how do you measure
    how much that contributed? So I don't think it's going to be one-to-one.
  sec: 3358
  time: '55:58'
  who: Boyan
- line: And you definitely need two, because you do need to at least qualitatively
    show, “We are roughly aligned with the benchmark at the beginning,” and we can
    demonstrate, at least visually, “This quarter, since the module has been deployed,
    fewer people churned.” Again, you get the question, “How did your stuff contribute?”
    But at least you are trying to work on the same thing. But you definitely need
    something at the beginning – anything is more than a zero there, I would say.

    of any books or other resources that you can recommend to listeners who want to
    learn more about this topic?
  sec: 3416
  time: '56:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Yes. The best technology book on strategy – there''s a book called Technology
    Strategy Patterns: Architecture as Strategy, which is a gem. Again, it''s a super
    criminally underrated book. I can really recommend that one. It''s focused a bit
    more on general stuff, not just that much about data, but it''s also very, very
    concrete. I will also say Practical DataOps. I already mentioned that one. And
    Infonomics: How to Monetize, Manage, and Measure Information as an Asset for Competitive
    Advantage, by Doug Laney. Infonomics is great. He talks about data assets and
    everything. Brilliant, a brilliant book. The book by Alexander Borek and Nadine
    Prill. That''s a really great one. It''s called Driving Digital Transformation
    through Data and AI: A Practical Guide to Delivering Data Science and Machine
    Learning Products. I have to get the link, but that''s a brilliant book. It''s
    also very specific. It goes much deeper than I do, with concrete questions. For
    example, “What do you ask a business person?” The final book, which is very weird,
    I''ll say, is called Secrets of Power Negotiating. A terrible name – a terrible,
    terrible name. It''s an old 70s, American-style book about how to negotiate and
    convince people. But it has absolutely brilliant advice on how you do that. A
    lot of data strategy work is just that. So read that one as well.'
