short: Teaching Data Engineers
title: Teaching Data Engineers
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about teaching data engineers. We have a special guest
    today, Jeff. Jeff has been teaching for quite some time. First, he was teaching
    data scientists, then data engineers. He will probably tell us more about that.
    So welcome, Jeff.
  sec: 80
  time: '1:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hey, thanks for having me.
  sec: 94
  time: '1:34'
  who: Jeff
- header: Jeff’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of teaching data engineers and teaching in
    general, let's start with your background. I know you have an amazing background,
    but it's probably better if you tell us about that. So can you tell us about your
    career journey so far?
  sec: 96
  time: '1:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I started as a lawyer and I went to law school. In my last semester
    of law school, I joined a tech startup. I was doing things like strategy for them
    – basically helping them expand their product and their offering. What I saw was
    that I started getting a lot of the questions that I wanted to answer and a lot
    of the work that I wanted to do just involved code. If we wanted to know what
    regions to move into, who our best salespeople were – we had to answer those questions
    with SQL and things like that. So that’s when I started coding.
  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Jeff
- line: And then I joined a law firm, because I had to pay off my student loans. But
    while I was there, I knew that I wanted to move into web development and learning
    how to code. I did General Assembly for three months. I was lucky enough to get
    hired by an awesome tech company. I really learned on the job for a couple years.
    After, I felt pretty good about being a developer and like I was really a contributor
    to the team for a little while.
  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Jeff
- line: I found myself actually reading a book on how to be a better teacher, which
    was weird because I never taught at that point before. I was like halfway through
    the book, and I just knew that education was a passion of mine. So I looked to
    see Flatiron School was hiring anyone and they were. They were looking for a new
    lead instructor. I applied on their website and started teaching there a few months
    later. I learned a ton there. I stayed there for about three and a half years,
    and then started my own school.
  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Jeff
- line: Yeah, that's pretty amazing – from law to software engineering, and then to
    teaching. That's amazing. So the book was How to Be a Better Teacher, right?
  sec: 216
  time: '3:36'
  who: Alexey
- header: Getting feedback to become a better teacher
- line: No, the book I was reading was called Teach Like a Champion.
  sec: 227
  time: '3:47'
  who: Jeff
- line: Teach Like a Champion. I should check it out. What does it talk about?
  sec: 232
  time: '3:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: The main takeaway I got from it… It’s actually for like high school/middle
    school teachers. I volunteered in high school, so you just see how much time can
    be wasted because the classroom time is only like 45 minutes long. So, literally,
    if you spend like 10 minutes getting people settled and then handing out the assignment,
    then you have like 30 minutes to teach a lesson. It’s crazy.
  sec: 236
  time: '3:56'
  who: Jeff
- line: But the main takeaway I got from that class was just feedback. Always try
    to be getting feedback from your students to see what they are actually learning
    and assess that constantly. So they would just give different mechanisms as to
    how to do that. And that's what I started working into the classroom and also
    what they did at Flatiron School.
  sec: 236
  time: '3:56'
  who: Jeff
- line: Interesting, I should check it out. So “getting feedback” is the main takeaway,
    right?
  sec: 286
  time: '4:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, there's an article written by Malcolm Gladwell on teaching and educators.
    That's basically the way – because there's a saying “How do you evaluate teachers?”
    – and that's the main way that they evaluate teachers. And one thing I'd say is
    that you'd be surprised – you could do an awesome job teaching a subject, but
    that does not mean the students understand it.
  sec: 291
  time: '4:51'
  who: Jeff
- line: I think teachers are often surprised about that, I often watch lectures given
    by these great Stanford professors and things like that, and then I'll see them
    give the quiz and I'm just surprised that, “Okay, the students did not retain
    this information,” because they're either doing other stuff, or there's so much
    to focus on or etc. But you're just always surprised when you go to assess student
    learning that it takes a few times for them for it to sink in.
  sec: 291
  time: '4:51'
  who: Jeff
- line: It's always the case, right? No matter how good the teacher is.
  sec: 340
  time: '5:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, the other thing is – you know passive learning versus active learning?
    One thing from another book, they said “Look at who's making the noise in the
    classroom – if it's the teacher, he's the one having fun, he's the one learning.
    If it's the student, they're the one having fun, and they're the ones learning.”
    So you can tell where the learning is going on just by who's the group of people
    being active.
  sec: 344
  time: '5:44'
  who: Jeff
- header: Going from engineering to teaching
- line: So you were a software engineer – you were doing development work – and then
    you accidentally bumped into this book and decided to become an instructor? Or
    how did this happen? Why did you decide to actually leave your software engineering
    job and become a teacher?
  sec: 373
  time: '6:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have been interested in education since I was about 20 years old. I did
    a lot of human rights stuff in undergrad. So I did this really cool summer program
    working with refugees and got really into it when I was like 20. I wanted to kind
    of keep going with that in college. So I was just looking for projects to help
    out similar types of groups and one thing I kept on hearing from people is, “Hey,
    can we donate this stuff to them? Or can we do this type of thing?” And they're
    like, “Alright. Well, they need cleaner water. So okay, you can give them water
    filters. But unless there's training to go along with it, they're not really going
    to know how to use it.” And they said, “By the way, instead of water filters –
    they could just boil their water.
  sec: 392
  time: '6:32'
  who: Jeff
- line: If you train them to do these sanitary things, then they actually don't need
    these services in the first place.” So we kept on running into education as a
    solution. For me, it really came from that element. Just reading about it – it
    involves so many different skill sets, it was just a great challenge. You could
    go in a lot of different directions with it and go very deep with it as well.
  sec: 392
  time: '6:32'
  who: Jeff
- line: It's like, instead of bringing people fish – teaching them how to fish, right?
  sec: 470
  time: '7:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but it's also like the last mile problem – unless the technology is
    really perfect. Okay, well, you hand it over to the people, are they actually
    using it? Also, when I went there, they were basically asking for education. They
    needed work. They’re refugees and they don't speak English. So it's like English
    training. In college, I was trying to develop an online program to help them learn
    English and things like that. So I just kept on running into education as something
    that seemed like a good solution, and it also was fun to do.
  sec: 475
  time: '7:55'
  who: Jeff
- header: Jeff on becoming a curriculum writer
- line: So you were studying at Flatiron or…? You said you studied at General Assembly.
    So this was there?
  sec: 515
  time: '8:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I was a lawyer, at that point, I really wanted to learn how to code.
    I just worked in a startup. I saw 10 people doing this amazing stuff. It blew
    me away. So when I was a lawyer, I was just itching to try to figure out how to
    code. At that point (it was 2013) there were only a few bootcamps for months that
    I could see. Right now they're called Recurse Center, I think, but at the time
    they had a different name. Anyway, they were more like a writers’ retreat for
    coders – for people that really could code. And then Flatiron School and General
    Assembly were really the first two coding bootcamps in New York City that you
    could get into. I didn't get into Flatiron School – I think they were filled up
    – so I went to General Assembly.
  sec: 522
  time: '8:42'
  who: Jeff
- line: Okay. You were looking for a teaching job, so you went to the Flatiron website
    (the careers page) and you saw a vacancy for a lead instructor. Then you worked
    there as a lead teacher. And I think your last position there, if I remember correctly,
    is Lead Curriculum Writer. So what does it mean to be a curriculum writer?
  sec: 576
  time: '9:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Essentially, my last role was really to build the data science course. Because
    at that point, they offered the web development course and they’d just been bought
    by WeWork, and they wanted to develop – both expand the school in terms of locations
    and also their product offerings. And I was really interested in data science.
    I kept on asking, even before that, if we could build a course on that. It basically
    involves first pitching to leadership that, “Hey, this would work, both in terms
    of employers hiring these students and the fact that students would want to apply
    for that.”
  sec: 598
  time: '9:58'
  who: Jeff
- line: There's a lot of competitor analysis, looking at the job market, looking at
    whether there is a viable career path, looking at student interests, things like
    that. And then it was also looking at other schools to see how they developed
    a curriculum and what subjects they taught, what it would mean for us to do something
    like that, talking to employers to get feedback from them, talking to past students
    from these other schools, and then just getting started writing curriculum. Then
    about six months in, we hired a team of curriculum writers to help out.
  sec: 598
  time: '9:58'
  who: Jeff
- line: So this is what you did as a lead curriculum writer. Right?
  sec: 675
  time: '11:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I guess so. I mean…
  sec: 679
  time: '11:19'
  who: Jeff
- line: This wasn't your title. As you said, you were web development, right?
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. I mean, my title didn't really… I don't know. I also then taught the
    first course while I was still the lead curriculum writer.
  sec: 687
  time: '11:27'
  who: Jeff
- line: Okay, but what does it actually mean to be lead curriculum writer?
  sec: 695
  time: '11:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: To be a lead curriculum writer? It means you write curriculum.
  sec: 698
  time: '11:38'
  who: Jeff
- header: Creating a curriculum that reinforces learning
- line: Yes, but what does it mean to write the curriculum? What does it mean to build
    the curriculum? What do you do there? What is a curriculum, actually?
  sec: 704
  time: '11:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, okay. First, you basically write out the syllabus and you try it. First,
    I guess I read and just got a bunch of ideas by looking at other people's syllabuses
    and topics and reading blog posts on the school experience and things like that.
    Then from there, you start to collect [cross-talk]
  sec: 712
  time: '11:52'
  who: Jeff
- line: Just general level topics, right? It could be regression, classification,
    clustering, time series, whatever.
  sec: 733
  time: '12:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Right. And then looking at Coursera courses, looking at statistics
    courses. You know, you kind of start with, “Okay, here are the topics we need
    to teach.” And then “What does that mean?” You go deep into these individual courses
    that are all kind of disparate and then you start to see how they line up. You
    always want the learning material to fold into one another. If you just teach
    it once and it's never used again, your brain learns that and you forget it immediately.
    So you want to see, “Okay, how do these topics build on one another?”
  sec: 739
  time: '12:19'
  who: Jeff
- line: Then you want to develop a syllabus where that lines up. Finally, you start
    writing the curriculum. You just start literally typing on the page, coding out
    and so on. I started with the intro material and just started writing that curriculum.
    As you're doing it, things change. Especially as you then go to teach the material,
    things change as well. The ordering changes, or you need more time here, and not
    as much time there, and things like that.
  sec: 739
  time: '12:19'
  who: Jeff
- line: The curriculum is a detailed description of each unit, or? [cross-talk]
  sec: 805
  time: '13:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, it's a syllabus, but then it's also literally readings. So you have
    to write out lessons for every corresponding lecture that you give. So each lecture
    – say the lecture is an hour – that probably consists of two to three different
    lessons and then probably two to three different labs. So you'll maybe give two
    different small labs, and then one larger lab to tie it all together.
  sec: 811
  time: '13:31'
  who: Jeff
- line: I see. So it could be like a step-by-step instruction of what exactly you're
    going to talk about. For example, if we take regression – first you show a data
    set, then you talk about importing SciKit Learn, then you talk about turning this
    dataset into something. Then you said there is a lab, so students actually sit
    and do that. And then there is another bunch of sessions of you talking about
    something, then students do something. So you describe all that on a piece of
    paper or in a Google document.
  sec: 841
  time: '14:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but I think you break it down very granularly because you want to understand
    each component of y= mx+b (or whatever). I think with regression it would be you
    would start with, “Okay. Well, this is B” Because that's the most simple probably
    to understand “and it just raises the line up and down. And then M, of course,
    is the slope.” And then from there, you’d probably be like, “Hey, by the way,
    we can build this and plot this out in code. As we change these numbers, as we
    change M and B, you can see this thing change.” So you want them to understand
    each component conceptually and then from there, you probably want them to really
    understand the application of it. Ideally, you want to understand the application
    first, and then go into the underlying components.
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Jeff
- line: Did you already know about data engineering back then when you wanted to teach
    it? [cross-talk]
  sec: 920
  time: '15:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no, I had no idea. When I was teaching data science, I'd say one thing
    I saw was – because I had been teaching web development at that point for a couple
    of years – one thing I kept seeing, and kind of kept on saying to myself and to
    some others was like, “Man, if they knew they're better at engineering, they would
    just be so much better at these projects and the skills.” You could just see how
    much it made sense.
  sec: 924
  time: '15:24'
  who: Jeff
- line: The reason why I was able to teach myself SK learn and PyTorch and things
    like that pretty quickly was because I was a software developer. I could read
    libraries pretty well and understand what was going on. I kept seeing that and
    kept trying to advocate for more and more backend development work. When I first
    launched my school, it was data science as well. And really, the turning point
    was just that the job market shifted, so that I felt like it was no longer a viable
    career path for someone to just go through a coding bootcamp and become a data
    scientist. But it was a viable career path to become a data engineer.
  sec: 924
  time: '15:24'
  who: Jeff
- header: Jeff on starting his own data engineering bootcamp
- line: Maybe, let's go a little bit back. At some point, you decided to leave Flatiron
    and start your own bootcamp. Why did you make this decision? Couldn’t you just
    follow the same approach? You could have pitched this to the school, right? [cross-talk]
  sec: 997
  time: '16:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I didn't know that data engineering… I left Flatiron School before that.
    But when I first taught at Flatiron school – I think the first course graduated
    in 2018 and 2019 – students got jobs as data scientists pretty quickly, even though
    the course still had a lot of improvement. But the job market was such that that
    was okay. They were getting great career paths out of it. So that was really cool.
    In terms of leaving Flatiron School, I guess there are other components that I
    wanted to do beyond just building curriculum.
  sec: 1018
  time: '16:58'
  who: Jeff
- line: There were other things and problems that I wanted to solve. One thing was
    career services. I felt like there was a huge opportunity in career services to
    just stick with the students. A lot of times what I saw was that students would
    be at this level – maybe right at the bar to get a job when they graduate – and
    then there was a huge difference between students that just had a good path going
    forward and those that are floundering. I would see it because we would check
    in on students that didn't get a job three to four months later it was like, “Oh,
    crap. They forgot so much of what we had been teaching them.” So that was one
    thing.
  sec: 1018
  time: '16:58'
  who: Jeff
- line: I thought the school could be way cheaper, by making it part time, by just
    lowering the tuition, things like that. I think like, for me, I also had this
    question of, “Okay, why doesn't everyone do this?” And I didn't feel like anyone
    had a good answer for that. I think when I left the school, it was things like
    that too, “I want to answer those kinds of questions that don't have to do with
    curriculum. And right now, I'm a teacher and I write curriculum.” So to do that,
    this is now starting to be my own school.
  sec: 1018
  time: '16:58'
  who: Jeff
- line: So to lower the price, you wanted to do it part-time for those who already
    studied there. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1136
  time: '18:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: That was really a dramatic thing. That was part of the “why doesn't everybody
    do this” type component. When you join a boot camp it’s always “Take the leap
    and trust”. And it's a boot camp, which means it's an all-encompassing type of
    thing. And I wanted it to be something where you don't have to put your whole
    career on the line to do this thing. It doesn't have to feel like… one, I went
    through boot camp and I know that it feels very vulnerable when you quit your
    job, and then you just put in so much trust in a school to really deliver. You
    have no other option.
  sec: 1144
  time: '19:04'
  who: Jeff
- line: At that point, you are in their hands. And if you don't quit your job, well
    then all of a sudden, that's not true at all. You know what I mean? If the school
    doesn't work out, or you don't like it, you can just walk away, effectively, and
    it's not a huge deal. But if something happens – you get sick, there's some sort
    of tragedy, or whatever – yeah, that's pretty dramatic when you quit your job
    and you're trying to transform your career in four months.
  sec: 1144
  time: '19:04'
  who: Jeff
- line: You saw that and you thought, “Okay, I should create my own school for people
    who will do it part time,” right? [cross-talk]
  sec: 1208
  time: '20:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was also “lower the barrier to entry.” Like, how do you lower the barrier
    to entry to make this possible? Really the first question was, again, “Why don't
    more people do this?” One thing I started doing was just teaching weekly workshops
    – right after work. Because that's a natural step to just showing people they
    can do it. It's not a huge commitment. Then, instead of showing up once a week,
    show up three times.
  sec: 1218
  time: '20:18'
  who: Jeff
- line: Obviously, there’s some more commitment but hopefully, you see that, “Hey,
    coding is more fun than you might think. It does not involve math and it's different
    than you might think.” The misconceptions around coding, from people who have
    never coded before, it's pretty dramatic. They were for me. So it was a lot of
    that, “How do you introduce this to people? How do you not make it such a huge
    step and make it an easier transition for people?”
  sec: 1218
  time: '20:18'
  who: Jeff
- header: Shifting from teaching ML and data science to teaching data engineering
- line: Yeah, interesting. You started first with machine learning for your own bootcamp
    – machine learning, data science, all that – but then you gradually shifted to
    data engineering. Why did you do that?
  sec: 1277
  time: '21:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it was all about the job opportunities. I was very surprised. Like I
    said, when I first started teaching data science, we went on people's LinkedIn
    who went to different boot camps and made sure there was a real career path. Same
    thing with the students that I taught, initially, they made the leap and they
    got to become data scientists. Some of them are doing some really amazing things
    now. My first data science class that I was teaching, I started talking to employers
    and telling them what my students are doing and things like that, and they replied,
    “Well, we still wouldn't be that interested. They still need more. They're still
    not actually great candidates. Do you know how many applications we get for this
    position? It’s crazy. I don't even know why I'm talking to you.”
  sec: 1288
  time: '21:28'
  who: Jeff
- line: How many? Do you remember?
  sec: 1341
  time: '22:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I remember… You could click on LinkedIn pages – so many of the jobs
    will say over 500. I spoke to a data scientist at BCG, who told me, “I get 20
    pings on LinkedIn a day asking me ‘how do I become a data scientist?’ The only
    reason I'm talking to you is because you seemed interesting and you have this
    school.” You can read Vicki Boykis’s blog, where she wrote that blog about “data
    science is different now,” and she talks about just so many people.
  sec: 1343
  time: '22:23'
  who: Jeff
- line: One of the things I wanted to point out is just, I would be like, “Yeah, but
    my students are really good.” And they were like. But it doesn't matter if there's
    just so much noise flooding the market. It's just not worth the time. I think
    the reason why people are looking for Master’s and PhDs – it’s just an easy way
    to cut out a bit of the applicant pool, just for mental sanity purposes. And then,
    you’re like “Alright, I'm just going to look at these people.”
  sec: 1343
  time: '22:23'
  who: Jeff
- line: And data engineering, on the other hand, was in demand, but did not have a
    lot of attention like data science. Right?
  sec: 1406
  time: '23:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly right. Yeah. One, you actually had engineering skills. If you graduate
    with working in data engineering – with data science, there's so much to learn,
    too. That was the other thing. It was hard to build a curriculum around it. I
    kept extending the course. It was originally six months, and then was like, “Okay.
    Well, we should teach AWS, Docker, and Airflow as well.” So I kept on extending
    it to the point that it was like, eight-nine months.
  sec: 1415
  time: '23:35'
  who: Jeff
- line: With data engineering it was a more defined skill set of Python, SQL, Cloud
    computing, orchestration, things like that. You could go deep into those subjects,
    so that you weren't just going an inch deep in 15 different subjects – you're
    focusing on really giving them solid Python SQL skills which are turning them
    into back end developers. Then also you add this data specialization on top.
  sec: 1415
  time: '23:35'
  who: Jeff
- line: Did you also see that some of the students who went through your data science
    bootcamp were getting jobs as data engineers, or not really?
  sec: 1472
  time: '24:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, we were able to get them… there were qualified students, like PhD students
    and people that had been working with SQL or things like that for five plus years.
    It was successful, but I didn't think it was sustainable. I thought it was still
    too much lift to get them there. I thought, “This was way too much work.” They
    crushed Kaggle competitions before they even graduated. They did so much stuff
    and I just was surprised with the resistance. But I did talk to graduates from
    other bootcamps because I was wondering, “Are they able to get data science jobs?
    How does this work?” And when I called the students and spoke to them, either
    they would get engineering jobs or data engineering jobs or analyst positions.
    But it felt like that door had closed.
  sec: 1482
  time: '24:42'
  who: Jeff
- line: Interesting. I talked to a data science boot camp here in Berlin and they
    said something similar – that many students that graduate from data science bootcamp
    end up being hired as data analysts. Therefore, they now are repurposing this,
    or rethinking their strategy – building a new curriculum for data analysts – because
    of how data scientists are usually hired. Meaning the data scientists that graduate
    from that bootcamp.
  sec: 1539
  time: '25:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I even wonder how much… I trust a person I’m hiring for machine learning
    more than data science to begin with. With data science I feel like there's a
    big diversity in the skill set asked. With machine learning, I think it's becoming
    more consolidated as a skill set being asked for – it's just pretty advanced.
    I think you need the data engineering skill set plus the machine learning skill
    set.

- header: Making sure that students get hired
- line: You have students who go through your bootcamp for data engineers, so how
    do you make sure they get hired?
  sec: 1600
  time: '26:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: We do a lot. One crucial thing is, honestly, the admissions – only admitting
    people that we believe are going to get hired at the end of it. That's the main
    question I asked myself. It's hard to do, because one, you like the applicants
    and you want to say ‘yes’ to people. Then, obviously I want to grow the school,
    but only doing that – I think that's a huge thing. Two, is the curriculum, we
    just try to have it line up perfectly with what employers are looking for. And
    then three, we do post-career work – we meet with them twice weekly to make sure
    that they're on track.
  sec: 1610
  time: '26:50'
  who: Jeff
- line: That also gives us feedback on the curriculum because I see what questions
    are being answered, I see how they're applying for jobs, things like that. Then
    finally, the only thing we saw on the first day of the data engineering course
    – we paired students up with employers after they graduated, working for free,
    because this way if it takes a few months to find a job, they're building experience.
    That was really successful, so we built that into this program – halfway through,
    you'll start working for a company for free. That way you have experience by the
    time you graduate.
  sec: 1610
  time: '26:50'
  who: Jeff
- line: Interesting, how does that actually work? Do companies often agree to this?
    Sometimes some random people write to me on LinkedIn, “Hey, I will work for free.
    Give me a job.” And then I'm like [chuckles] “Okay, but how do you do that?” And
    then another thing is, if a person is working for free, I do not trust the motivation
    of this person. They might just decide one day not to show up, because why would
    they? So I have very mixed feelings. Another thing here is like, “Why for free?”
    Can’t they just pay minimum wage for that as well?
  sec: 1687
  time: '28:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So there are a couple things that we saw too. If students just asked
    for an internship, it's still an investment on the side of the company. The most
    expensive thing is still going to be a senior engineer’s time to make sure and
    do project management and things like that. So that's why we kind of said, “Okay,
    we'll help you with coaching the students and kind of be the manager for the students.”
    So it's like they deliver a good amount of stuff for us.
  sec: 1725
  time: '28:45'
  who: Jeff
- line: The other thing is, we basically say, “Hey, find projects that are not mission
    critical, but are nice to have and will really provide value. And if they're delivered,
    you'll use them.” Then, we also allocate in-class time. We allocate six hours
    per week and make sure students tell us in advance if they're available for additional
    hours, and that they stick to that. As a teacher, we provide a lot of, “Hey, this
    is what you signed up for. We have to deliver. We have to be engaged in it.” The
    admissions really helps – our students are professionals and they're quite good.
    They provide that professionalism when they do the job.

    engineering already. Is this for them, or they are not [cross-talk]
  sec: 1825
  time: '30:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. I mean, we have taken people like that. I would say some of our students
    – maybe about a third to 20% have had previous engineering experience or have
    gone to other boot camps and things like that. By the way, we've had people that
    have been CTOs for different organizations, but that doesn't necessarily validate
    their coding background or skill set. So we always do a technical interview. What
    we do is give them free curriculum that we have on the website, like “Intro to
    Coding” – starting from zero to whatever in Python. We say, “Hey, go do the first
    10 lessons and then we'll give you an assessment.” When we're doing the assessment,
    what I do is look to see if they understand each step. Like they're not memorizing
    anything, but they can tell me why they're using each step. And then if I give
    them something a little bit off the track of what they learned in the curriculum,
    can they respond to my teaching style and understand this?
  sec: 1832
  time: '30:32'
  who: Jeff
- line: So you're looking to see, “Are they thinking?” It’s hard to do when you're
    under pressure and then translating those thoughts into code. If they can do that,
    that's pretty good, right? If they've only spent a couple of weeks and they were
    able to do that – that's pretty good. You also pick up a lot of things like, “Alright,
    are they going to put in the work? Are they motivated to put in the work?” Those
    components. I've already spoken to them at this point. In the earlier stage, we
    see “Okay, what are they looking to get out of this program? What do they know
    about the industry? What's their previous background that employers might look
    for and find attractive when they then go to hire them?” So there are things like
    that that we're also looking at.
  sec: 1832
  time: '30:32'
  who: Jeff
- header: Knowing when it’s time to apply for jobs
- line: I have a question that is quite relevant to what we're talking about, “How
    does one know that the students are ready to apply for an entry-level data engineer
    role?” Maybe I will rephrase it a little bit, because it's similar to a question
    I wanted to ask, which is “What do you include in the program?” I think they are
    similar because you probably know what entry level data engineers should know.
    You put these things specifically in the curriculum, right? Am I correct that
    this is how you know that they are ready? Because you include only the things
    that they need to know? [cross-talk]
  sec: 1951
  time: '32:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we can put it in the curriculum, but it goes back to the same thing
    – they need to master and really understand that material. Not only that, it’s
    really 400+ hours of material over six months. Trust me, when they graduate, to
    a lot of them, I'll say “Apply. Start applying for jobs, even if you're not ready.
    Alright? Start applying. It’s cool. Get those rejections out of the way.” And
    that's a good motivating factor and we start to see. So we do that.
  sec: 1985
  time: '33:05'
  who: Jeff
- line: The other thing is, we'll give them technical interview questions and see
    how they perform in that. But there's no harm in applying to the job, especially
    when they're starting to get takers and people that accept them, which you generally
    get when you have those skill sets. That's a nice thing – they don't have too
    many problems getting interviews. So I encourage them to get the interviews. Get
    scared. Bomb an interview. Then we can use that and they'll be motivated to improve.
  sec: 1985
  time: '33:05'
  who: Jeff
- line: Basically, what you're saying is – they might not be ready, but they just
    need to get over this fear of rejection.
  sec: 2053
  time: '34:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, interviewing is a skill in and of itself. You see all the time on
    LinkedIn, how the technical interview does not line up to the job. Of course,
    we all know that. Being great at interviewing is itself a skill, probably no matter
    what job you're applying for. So I want them to start doing that and it will start
    to put them on track as well as – they bombed the interview, now they really want
    to start practicing LeetCode. Now they see like, “Oh crap, I really need to improve.
    I thought it was good at SQL, but now I’ve really got to improve it even more.”
  sec: 2062
  time: '34:22'
  who: Jeff
- line: Okay. Technically, from what I understood from you, the students are already
    ready technically, but they just need to learn how to pass the interview – what
    kind of questions get asked, how to answer these questions. And these questions
    are not always technical. From my experience, maybe 50% of the interview is not
    super technical. They're like, “Okay, tell me about yourself. Tell me about the
    project that you're proud of. Tell me about x, y, z.” And you need to have some
    practice in answering these questions. The only way you can learn is I guess going
    into interviews. Right?
  sec: 2101
  time: '35:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, that's true. But I think it really helps to talk to an engineer about
    your experience – like if you have a friend that's an engineer. What I'll do is,
    before students go on interviews, I have every student send me their resume. I
    look through their resume and then I talk to them for like, 30-40 minutes about
    their job experience. I'd say inevitably, I'll be like, “Oh, I didn't get any
    of that from your resume. That'd be super attractive to an employer. Let's put
    that in there.” That process basically entails that what we put on the resume
    now focuses on what you want to talk about in the interview.
  sec: 2135

- line: Okay. What do you actually put on the curriculum? What are the topics there?
  sec: 2178
  time: '36:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first section, we think of it like analytics engineering – so it's Python,
    with a strong focus on SQL. Then it’s building an analytics engineering pipeline
    – so Fivetran, DBT, Snowflake. Then we use Mode as a business intelligence tool.
    So that's the first section.
  sec: 2182
  time: '36:22'
  who: Jeff
- line: Then the second section is essentially backend engineering. So it's Flask,
    building ORMs, the adapter pattern, ETL in Python – MVC, obviously. And that takes
    a while to go through that and testing. A lot of that is like, “How do you write
    code for a larger codebase? How do you navigate a larger codebase?” Things like
    that. That's another 10 weeks or so.
  sec: 2182
  time: '36:22'
  who: Jeff
- line: Then, finally, we go into cloud computing and Airflow to Docker, AWS, Airflow.
    We also layer in, starting in that second semester, one – they start their internship
    (we do that for six hours per week) and then also, we start layering in interview
    questions. So they start kind of thinking that way.
  sec: 2182
  time: '36:22'
  who: Jeff
- header: The market demand of Spark, Kafka, and Kubernetes (or lack thereof)
- line: I'm making some comparisons and parallels with the course we have – Data Engineering
    Zoomcamp. We have this data analytics engineering module, but we don't really
    talk about Fivetran, we cover just DBT. But we do cover things like Spark and
    Kafka, which you do not cover, right?
  sec: 2261
  time: '37:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: We do not cover that. We taught Spark in the first iteration, so we have curriculum
    on that.  But we saw that it wasn't really asked in interviews and it wasn't really
    required of juniors. I see it a lot for our senior engineering positions. We scraped
    all these data engineering positions – it does come up a lot. I wanted to look
    deeper to see if it's even listed for junior data engineering positions – like
    zero to three years experience – and it wasn't asked in interviews. So that's
    why we were like, “Okay, we have other things to teach.”
  sec: 2285
  time: '38:05'
  who: Jeff
- line: Okay. And Kafka I guess. I remember when we first met, it was a couple of
    years ago and I think you were showing me some curriculum and you were asking
    for my feedback on it. I think we talked about Kafka at some point, right? You
    wanted to include this, but at the end, I guess you decided to drop it. Was it
    the same thing as with Spark?
  sec: 2323
  time: '38:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it was the same thing. It's listed, again, for more senior level positions.
    The other thing is, this analytics engineering role really has grown in the past
    couple of years. So we wanted to focus and also put time into that. But the truth
    is, we started taking out things. We used to teach Kubernetes too. We saw that
    while it turned heads and people were impressed that the students knew it, and
    sometimes they would even ask questions on it, it took so long – it took like
    two and a half weeks to teach it, which is a good chunk of the course. But then
    it just wasn't enough value added to justify keeping it.
  sec: 2343
  time: '39:03'
  who: Jeff
- line: Yeah. Again, I remember our discussion a couple of years ago where you said
    that there is no good book that covers machine learning and Kubernetes and I thought,
    “Okay, I need to include this in my book.”
  sec: 2384
  time: '39:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right, right. Exactly. [chuckles]
  sec: 2395
  time: '39:55'
  who: Jeff
- line: It's a very complex topic. I realized that it can be very overwhelming for
    people entering the field.
  sec: 2396
  time: '39:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can teach it, I really think. You teach Docker first, obviously. We were
    able to successfully teach Kubernetes. The other part of it that was not great
    was that people stopped coding. You know what I mean? With Kubernetes, you're
    writing YAML files – you're not coding. And that's two and a half weeks that the
    students are not coding. That was the other thing – we always wanted reinforcing
    skill sets. So if you look at the curriculum – I tell people that are applying,
    “Yeah, the curriculum is really 85% Python and SQL.” That's really what we're
    teaching. All the time.
  sec: 2404
  time: '40:04'
  who: Jeff
- header: Advice for data analysts that want to move into data engineering
- line: A question we have is “What steps should a data analytics or BI professional
    take to become a data engineer?” We kind of partly covered that when you were
    describing the curriculum. Maybe they should start with analytics engineering.
    Right? What do you think about that?
  sec: 2442
  time: '40:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: For analytics engineering, or data engineering?
  sec: 2458
  time: '40:58'
  who: Jeff
- line: For data analysts – they want to become data engineers. So what kind of steps
    should they take?
  sec: 2461
  time: '41:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I see. The main thing to ramp up on is backend engineering and cloud
    computing. Cloud computing is probably the easier step to fill in the gaps with,
    and then Python. If you want to just start applying for jobs, maybe you start
    with cloud computing. But probably, on the job, a lot of what will be asked of
    you will be Python. And I think you're seeing more and more people asking Python
    questions in the interviews.
  sec: 2467
  time: '41:07'
  who: Jeff
- line: What about things like Fivetran, DBT?
  sec: 2498
  time: '41:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, definitely. I mean, they're easier to learn. Fivetran you can learn
    in a day or less than that. It's designed to be very easy to learn. DBT – same
    type of thing. You can navigate DBT well enough for interviews probably in a week
    or two. It's not so bad. What's harder for ‘on the job’ is the DBT patterns –
    and you should know that stuff, like staging and integration and marks. So learning
    that stuff is valuable, but I think if you can just start navigating DBT and then
    more writing CTEs and writing modular SQL code, that will be helpful.
  sec: 2501
  time: '41:41'
  who: Jeff
- line: What is a CTE?
  sec: 2546
  time: '42:26'

    a clause.
  sec: 2548
  time: '42:28'
  who: Jeff
- line: You said that you scraped a lot of job descriptions and you saw that Spark
    is not there for junior positions, but it's present for seniors. I’m wondering,
    how often do you see Fivetran and things like Airbyte – these lower-code things?
  sec: 2557

- line: Well, yeah – I just did it for data engineers, literally in the past month.
    In the analytics engineering stack, it does not show up at all. It shows up, but
    I literally see like 10 out of 400 job descriptions or listings with DBT – which
    is kind of crazy. Even the words – ETL shows up at the very top, but then ELT
    is nowhere to be found.
  sec: 2583
  time: '43:03'
  who: Jeff
- line: I think people just use them interchangeably. Even I always confuse them,
    like “Oh, what is the difference? I'll just go with ETL. It doesn't matter. I
    just mean ‘data pipeline.’”
  sec: 2607
  time: '43:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but when you look at the Slack channels then you'll see DBT and Airbyte
    and things like that listed – in any of these Slack channels. But I don't know,
    in the job descriptions, I'm not sure if it's companies that aren't as plugged
    in or if it's just the job description isn't lining up or whatever.
  sec: 2618

    or not. [cross-talk]
  sec: 2637

  who: Alexey
- line: '[cross-talk] It depends on if there''s a market for it. I know that we can
    go to the Slack channels or these employers and they''d be attracted to people
    that really know DBT. And the same thing when I talk to employers who are like,
    “Oh, do you have people that don''t really know DBT? We''d love that?” and I''m
    like, “Okay, we''ll make them learn it.”'

    is a useful skill. How does one improve SQL if somebody wants to do that?”
  sec: 2661
  time: '44:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You basically need to know SQL in and out. Beyond aggregates, obviously,
    and joins – that’s kind of level one. Then you probably want to know window functions,
    which is a favorite of interview questions. You know, if you look at data engineering
    interviews, people will be like “Oh I always ask this LeetCode question. And I
    always ask this LeetCode question.” So those LeetCode questions – you should probably
    be at the medium level.
  sec: 2673
  time: '44:33'

    challenges and SQL problems as well. You mean the SQL ones?
  sec: 2707
  time: '45:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean the SQL – just click on LeetCode for SQL and then be able to do probably
    up to medium – for most positions that’s pretty good. That's really the main way
    they'll be assessing SQL. The other thing is going to be data modeling, like knowing
    the difference in modeling between, OLTP versus OLAP. So practice modeling – you
    could probably find them online as well. That's definitely fair game for people
    to ask.
  sec: 2714

    teacher that taught at Turing school, I think (or something like that) – they
    said, REST is really good for teaching data modeling, because it's pretty similar
    principles. So there's like REST for mere mortals. And then, of course, the Kindle
    book. But sometimes it's a bit too much.
  sec: 2752

  who: Jeff

  sec: 2777
  time: '46:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's very wordy. I feel like the first couple chapters are enough of
    it. I think that there is some stuff online where you can do it. The other thing
    are those classic databases, like Microsoft has – like the Northwind database
    and things – those types of databases and see how they're modeled. Try to model
    them in advance. You can take any kind of domain – like an airport, right? I give
    my students that, “Okay, model an airport. Here's a ticket for a flight at an
    airport, you do the modeling for it.” Then you could show it to an engineer, or
    maybe if you google it online, maybe people already have an answer for it.
  sec: 2779
  time: '46:19'
  who: Jeff

    lot.
  sec: 2829
  time: '47:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, like look at sample databases. Also, maybe if you go to code bases that
    are online. For instance, some organizations, if you look at their open source
    repositories – just go to their models afterwards and look at it. Draw it out.
    Even just drawing it out would probably be useful. But if beforehand, you guess
    “What is the relationship?” Or “How is this modeled?” That would probably be really
    useful.

    never ends. It overwhelms sometimes.”
  sec: 2866
  time: '47:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So that's why I think there's no harm in just attending an interview
    just do it – just for the experience. Maybe we can give some expectation as to
    what probably is going to be asked in an interview. The first interview would
    probably be a screening interview. Maybe they'll ask you a little bit about data
    engineering, maybe they'll ask you OLTP versus OLAP. Maybe they'll just ask you,
    “Have you built any data pipelines?” And, “Tell me about some of the tools you've
    used in data engineering.” Things like that. You don't need to know every one
    of them. But they just want to know that you've spent some time with this.
  sec: 2880

    expect that, I'd say, if you can do some of the medium LeetCode problems, then
    you should feel pretty good. And you don't have to get them 100% right. But if
    you don't feel blown away by the medium SQL questions, then you're probably pretty
    good. At that point, go and interview. It's fine. There will be more interviews
    that show up. So I'd say, go to the interview and that will help you a little
    bit to self-assess afterwards. You can see where you are.
  sec: 2880
  time: '48:00'
  who: Jeff
- line: One thing I would say – one caveat to that and one thing to be careful of
    – sometimes I'll see students go on an interview and they'll BS something out
    of left field, and of course, they bomb it. Then they’ll be like, “I gotta learn
    that thing. I gotta learn everything about that thing.” Then you come back to
    them two months later, and they're still just learning everything about that thing.
    So you want to stay on your learning path. “Okay, I'm building a data pipeline.
    I'm improving my SQL skills. I'm going through some Python LeetCode problems.”
    Because those will also be asked.
  sec: 2880
  time: '48:00'
  who: Jeff
- header: How to get started in teaching
- line: Okay. There are still a couple of questions I want to ask. The question I
    want to ask most is “If somebody wants to start teaching software engineering
    or data engineering or data science – any topic – what would you suggest to them?”
    Let's say I am a data engineer already. I do not have experience in teaching.
    What should I do?
  sec: 2992
  time: '49:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. The first thing is – think of a topic, I guess, that is beginner level.
    Meaning that one, it’s something that a beginner can accomplish and two, would
    be interesting to a beginner. That itself will be a process. It took me multiple
    tries to get there. And then I’d say to explain it to someone. Explain it to someone
    at the level that you want your audience to be – just one person – and walk them
    through it. Teach them it and then see if they know it. Then also maybe hear their
    feedback on it. That would be pretty good, actually.
  sec: 3015
  time: '50:15'
  who: Jeff
- line: At that point, you're probably ready to deliver that to a meet up – to a small
    classroom – something like that. If you can do it in person, it's better because
    – one, it’s easier in person, actually, than online. And then two, you get more
    feedback. The feedback is almost immediate – you can sense everything when you're
    teaching in person. You can see their faces and things like that, which sometimes
    online, you can’t. So if you can just give a workshop in person – that will be
    great. And then do it again. Just give that same workshop to a different meetup.
    And revise it. That's kind of the teaching process –then revise the workshop,
    and think about it, and change the order of stuff, and do it again.
  sec: 3015
  time: '50:15'
  who: Jeff
- line: How do you revise it? Is it based on the questions you get? You explain something
    and then you see that clearly everybody is lost? Right? And then you say, “Okay,
    probably I should explain something else first.”
  sec: 3104
  time: '51:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sometimes it’s the questions – questions can be really good and give you a
    sense that people think what you’re teaching is kind of cool. Lots of times, you
    want to get to the point as fast as possible, or show the benefit as fast as possible.
    One of the reasons why I said teaching online is harder, is because online, people
    can just leave in a millisecond. If you're boring for like five minutes – they're
    going on Netflix, immediately.
  sec: 3116
  time: '51:56'
  who: Jeff
- line: If you're not interesting within the first five minutes, [chuckles] it's amazing
    to just see the people drop out of the Zoom. I found that one of my best lectures
    in person was building a neural network from scratch. Lots of people showed up
    and they got a lot out of it. But then I delivered it online, and  because there
    was such a lead-up until we got to the interesting stuff in, over half the people
    left by the time we got there. So I just had to totally flip the order of everything
    to make it work. It told me a lot about “Oh, if I can actually put this here and
    then we can start getting to the point way earlier.”
  sec: 3116
  time: '51:56'
  who: Jeff
- line: Okay. When people come to the classroom, it's not so easy for them to leave
    and switch to Netflix because they are physically in that room.
  sec: 3185
  time: '53:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly right. They're physically there. They're with people. Things like
    that. You can also give them activities to do. In zoom sessions, it’s a lot harder.
    Once you tell people to do something, I found that's another point where people
    would just drop off. But in person, it's great. You're just like, “Okay, here's
    this activity. Turn to the person next to you and work on it with them.” That
    stuff is great.
  sec: 3194
  time: '53:14'
  who: Jeff
- line: Then you said “pick something beginner level and explain it to somebody.”
    How do I pick up this somebody? How do I select who to talk to?
  sec: 3221
  time: '53:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I tell my mom. You know what I mean? Really, if you go on my website,
    it’s like “Me teaching my mom how to code in 10 Lessons.” [laughs] [cross-talk]
  sec: 3229
  time: '53:49'
  who: Jeff
- line: You actually recorded that?
  sec: 3240
  time: '54:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: What’s that? [Alexey repeats] Yeah, I recorded it. Yes, it's on the website.
    [laughs] And people were like, “I'm signing up because I saw you teach your mom
    to code.” [laughs] She gave me great feedback, because this is someone who, one,
    has no background in coding, let alone email. And, two has zero interest in code.
    She's retired – she's not going to use this. When I'm giving these lessons, going
    through lists and “Here's how you select from…” you know, all that – she's like,
    “Why do I need to know that?” Which is how you're supposed to teach – everything
    should be directly solving the problem, so they want to learn it and you're answering
    their question. That's like how you see that that's a good lesson.
  sec: 3241
  time: '54:01'
  who: Jeff
- header: The challenges of being a one-person company
- line: All this time when you talk about the bootcamp, you say “we” “we teach” but
    I think you're a one-person company? Right? [chuckles]
  sec: 3294
  time: '54:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: More or less. No, I have a co-founder. But yeah, in terms of the education
    and things like that – yeah, it's basically me.
  sec: 3304
  time: '55:04'
  who: Jeff
- line: How difficult is it for you to run this? What are the main challenges?
  sec: 3311
  time: '55:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: You know, writing the curriculum was a massive lift – probably over 2500 pages
    of curriculum in the past three years. That's where my law background really helps
    – I can just write 8-page essays like they're nothing. Also the education.
  sec: 3318
  time: '55:18'
  who: Jeff
- line: '[chuckles] That’s useful.'
  sec: 3339
  time: '55:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I found a use for it. Thank God. But I'm still just writing constantly
    – really all the time, for such a long time. But I'd say that's kind of another
    challenge, which hopefully I did properly. When people asked me what I did, if
    someone just randomly met me, I’d say, “I'm a curriculum writer.” That's all I
    did for basically two and a half years. It was writing curriculum and then teaching
    the course 17 hours a week.
  sec: 3340
  time: '55:40'
  who: Jeff
- line: One of the nice things about this business is that I've been able to focus
    on one thing at a time. Before I started the course, it was marketing and giving
    these workshops and things like that. Then once the course starts, for the next
    six-eight months, I'm just writing curriculum and doing that. Then when students
    graduate, like right now, I'm focusing on getting them jobs and marketing the
    next class. That's it. I'm not writing curriculum right now – I'm doing those
    two things. So at least just having a couple of things on my plate and not five
    different things on my plate at once, makes it manageable.
  sec: 3340
  time: '55:40'
  who: Jeff
- header: Teaching fundamentals vs the “shiny new stuff”
- line: We have quite a few questions about the interviews. I just want to mention
    that Jeff will come to DataTalks.club again and will do a webinar about getting
    a data engineer job. That will actually cover that – mostly the interviews and
    how you need to prepare for that. So I apologize, but I will skip these questions,
    because there are a few questions that are related to actually teaching.
  sec: 3406
  time: '56:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: One interesting question is, “We learn the latest technologies, but most companies
    go for ‘tried and tested technologies’ (they prefer traditional versus new shiny
    tech). What is your opinion on that? Should we teach the new stuff? Should we
    teach the old stuff? Should we somehow find a balance? How do you do that?”
  sec: 3406
  time: '56:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, you teach the fundamentals. I mean, the traditional tech is SQL and
    Python. Yeah, that sounds great. Even if you're a junior engineer, I'd say, if
    you can improve your Python skills – that's awesome. My first year as a software
    engineer, the other junior engineer next to me was just building Tetris and pure
    Ruby. And that's what the senior developer advised him to do “Just build arbitrary
    programming in Ruby. That's it.”
  sec: 3456
  time: '57:36'
  who: Jeff
- line: He got a job at Apple by the end of that year, so it seemed like good advice.
    I think you don't have to go super deep. Writing good Airflow code means that
    most of the code is in Python and is not relying on Airflow. Most of your skill
    set should be on Python and SQL. Like I said, that's what 85% of our course is,
    and then only probably like 15% is these shiny new technologies. But cloud computing
    – you can feel safe learning Docker and AWS. I think that's a safe bet. There
    are enough companies that are interested in that.
  sec: 3456
  time: '57:36'
  who: Jeff
- line: So if I want to teach data engineering, then I should teach SQL, Python, cloud
    computing, Docker, and that probably is the 20% that covers (Pareto principle)
    that covers 80% of the work.
  sec: 3528
  time: '58:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, it depends who you're teaching it to. You know what I mean?
    You go to these Coursera courses and they're good. They teach you these skills,
    but they're not going deep into Python and SQL. Or they assume, I guess, that
    you already know that. But if you're taking someone who is not an engineer, or
    has not really worked with SQL that deeply before, you need to ramp them up on
    that intensely. That has to be the focus of the course.
  sec: 3543
  time: '59:03'
  who: Jeff
- header: JigsawLabs.io
- line: Okay. So it seems we're out of time. But maybe you want to mention anything
    before we wrap up?
  sec: 3571
  time: '59:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. So, we are accepting applications for a new course. The next course
    is June 15th. It's gone well. Everyone from our last cohort got a new job. The
    minimum salary was 100k, which for me, actually, isn’t particularly interesting.
    You know, I want their salary just to be good, but I just mainly care that they
    are launching a new career. Then this course also went well – they just graduated
    a couple of weeks ago, but we had a student get a job and has been a data engineer
    for the past couple months now. He got employed before he graduated. You can go
    to JigsawLabs.io if you're interested.
  sec: 3578
  time: '59:38'
  who: Jeff
- header: Finding Jeff online
- line: Yeah, I was going to ask how they can find it. Can you send me the link? If
    people want to find you and ask a question, what's the best way?
  sec: 3621
  time: '1:00:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Oh, yeah. They can email me: jeff@ JigsawLabs.io. They can also ping me on
    LinkedIn. Just do “Jeff Katz” and type in Jigsaw. Yeah. Alexey, if you can just
    save the questions about the interview stuff, I can make sure that [cross-talk]'
  sec: 3630
  time: '1:00:30'
  who: Jeff
- line: Yes, I will. I am going to send you these questions. They are about system
    design. They're about something else. I definitely saw a question about system
    design, testing pipelines, and some other stuff. Yeah. There are some questions
    related to teaching, which certainly we could not cover. But I'll send you them
    as well, so you have them.
  sec: 3646
  time: '1:00:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Great. Thanks, man. That's great.
  sec: 3670
  time: '1:01:10'
  who: Jeff
- line: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, for asking questions. Thanks, Jeff.
    By the way, when you look for Jeff in LinkedIn, there is another Jeff Katz, so
    be careful. There is one in Berlin – this is not right Jeff. I made this mistake
    once, so now I have two Jeffs in my LinkedIn network. [laughs]
  sec: 3674
  time: '1:01:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I’m glad he accepted you.
  sec: 3694
  time: '1:01:34'
  who: Jeff
- line: Yes, he did. So, he's my first level connection. He's also in the data space
    – so that was also very confusing for me. Anyways, yeah. Thanks for joining us
    today and have a great weekend!
  sec: 3695
