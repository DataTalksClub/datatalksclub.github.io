short: Freelancing and Consulting with Data Engineering
title: Freelancing and Consulting with Data Engineering
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about freelancing in data engineering. We have a special
    guest today, Adrian. Adrian worked as a data engineer, but four years ago (if
    I'm right, he will correct me if I'm wrong) he decided that office life is not
    for him and that he wants to be a freelancer. So, welcome.
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. It's actually five years now. Yes, five years – since two days
    ago.
  sec: 119
  time: '1:59'
  who: Adrian
- line: Wow! [chuckles]
  sec: 127
  time: '2:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: So thank you for having me. Yeah.
  sec: 129
  time: '2:09'
  who: Adrian
- header: Adrian’s background
- line: Thanks for joining. Before we go into our main topic of freelancing in data
    engineering, let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career
    journey so far?
  sec: 132
  time: '2:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: I studied economics with a specialty in marketing in Romania. I thought it
    would be a platform or a method to statistically analyze people's behavior. But
    I discovered that the marketing industry was mostly people that wanted to be creative,
    and not so much look at the results. We even had a joke about PR that's basically
    when you throw the money out the window and you don't look at the results.
  sec: 142
  time: '2:22'
  who: Adrian
- line: That aside, I came to Berlin at age 25. I wanted to do things more mathematical
    and more logical, so I started a business analyst role. Five years later, I started
    working in a corporation. I didn't like it, so I switched to freelancing. I have
    to say, I really love the journey. Given the choice to make those choices again,
    I would choose freelancing again, but sooner.
  sec: 142
  time: '2:22'
  who: Adrian
- line: So you would keep the part where you work in a corporation?
  sec: 204
  time: '3:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: I wouldn't, but you know…
  sec: 210
  time: '3:30'
  who: Adrian
- line: '[laughs] Okay. Can you tell us about this story? How did you become a freelancer?'
  sec: 214
  time: '3:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, in all honesty, I hadn’t worked in startups for quite a while. Startups
    are known, especially like 10 years ago, they were known for being very poorly
    paying. I joined the corporation about five years into my career and I found that,
    despite the better level of pay, the level of challenge was much lower – both
    the standards and the opportunities to do things. I didn't like it. I actually
    couldn't quite adjust to the environment. I couldn't make it work for myself.
    I wasn't able to actually perform my job duties and I was let go. I was actually
    too demotivated at the time to look for a new job. I literally couldn't see the
    good thing about joining another company. So what happened was, I just told the
    recruiters “Yeah, if you want to place me – place me on a project.”
  sec: 220
  time: '3:40'
  who: Adrian
- line: That's the end of the story? How did it go after that?
  sec: 287
  time: '4:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: The recruiter that I was talking to got back to me with a couple of projects.
    Within a couple of conversations, I was already signing the contract. My first
    project was helping a team clean up a lot of legacy that had been left behind
    over the years and implement Airflow. That was pretty nice. It was actually the
    first time I was doing that. I guess I was worried in the beginning that work
    would be difficult to come along, but actually, the projects just kept coming.
    I didn't even take vacation for the first year and a half.
  sec: 290
  time: '4:50'
  who: Adrian
- header: Freelancing vs Employment
- line: It seems like it was quite easy for you. A recruiter just reached out to you
    and you said, “Hey, you know what? I'm more interested in project-based work rather
    than a full-time job.” And then the recruiter got back to you, right? Sounds quite
    easy. Was it like that?
  sec: 333
  time: '5:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is actually like that. When it comes to the fit between yourself and the
    job, you normally have a lot more steps involved. You want to look for good company,
    you want to look for a good team, you have maybe four, maybe six interviews. With
    freelancing, it's not like that. It's more or less like they look at your history,
    they ask you if you can do it, what you think about it. And you should be honest
    because, frankly, if you can't do it, that's just going to follow your reputation.
    If everybody has a good feeling, then it usually takes only one or two talks.
    There is no job security, so if they don't like working with you, you could get
    fired within a day or five.
  sec: 346
  time: '5:46'
  who: Adrian
- line: So that's why the process is much easier, right? Because to get a job at a
    corporation, you need, as you said, four to six interviews. And there are all
    sorts of interviews – behavioral interviews, coding exercises, take-home assignments,
    and so on. But here you just talk – they tell you what to do, you say if you can
    or cannot do this and that's pretty much it. That sounds way easier. [chuckles]
    Why isn’t everyone doing this?
  sec: 398
  time: '6:38'
  who: Alexey
- header: Risk and occupancy rate in freelancing
- line: Yeah, I think the reason why not a lot of people are doing this is because
    nobody likes risk. And there is an element of risk involved. Ultimately, you need
    to calculate with some kind of occupancy rate. I think if you calculate with it
    at around 75%, then you might be on the same level as salary, depending on how
    well you negotiate your salary.
  sec: 426
  time: '7:06'
  who: Adrian
- line: What is occupancy rate?
  sec: 453
  time: '7:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Excuse me?
  sec: 457
  time: '7:37'
  who: Adrian
- line: What is occupancy rate? You said it should be 75% or something.
  sec: 459
  time: '7:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are hours you're going to manage to occupy. You have about 2000 a year,
    maybe less. So if you can calculate with occupying 1500, that would be good.
  sec: 463
  time: '7:43'
  who: Adrian
- line: So this is the risk – not being able to occupy all the hours. Correct?
  sec: 478
  time: '7:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Frankly, the risk is real. For a lot of people, there is a lot of risk.
    If you take a salary that's equivalent to 75% of what you could make as a freelancer
    and people's expectation of you might also be different, the process with feedback
    and adjustment might be different. Some people say that's false security. I would
    agree since I've worked in my share of startups, and I've been on the list, and
    I've seen other people on the list – and I keep seeing them. This keeps happening.
  sec: 483
  time: '8:03'
  who: Adrian
- line: The list? What is the list?
  sec: 523
  time: '8:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[inaudible] I think, only in the last couple of months, we''ve seen a few.
    Right?'
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Adrian
- line: Ah, these kinds of lists. Okay. But still, a full-time job is probably more
    secure, in a way, in that it's not easy to let people go. Maybe?
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Ultimately, you can have unemployment insurance. So in the worst case, you're
    going to receive unemployment pay as a freelancer. You can optionally pay the
    insurance but at least in Germany, the payout is kept at such a low amount, it
    wouldn't be worth it really because you'd be paying a very large percentage of
    a large sum of money, which you wouldn't ever be getting back.
  sec: 544
  time: '9:04'
  who: Adrian
- header: The scariest part of freelancing
- line: What was the scariest part for you when you were transitioning to freelancing?
    Okay, you told the recruiter that you were more interested in projects and then
    the recruiter told you “Okay, we have these projects.” Were you scared at this
    point? Did you worry about this?
  sec: 567
  time: '9:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was more worried about impostor syndrome in the beginning. Also, let's say
    on my second project, we didn't have very good chemistry or “team fit,” so I didn't
    enjoy working in that team. I wanted to end it early, which I did. It was the
    right decision – everybody was happy with it. I was initially worried, “Am I going
    to find work?” But I did.
  sec: 583
  time: '9:43'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay. So you're saying that something like that might happen. Since there
    are just two interviews, and during these interviews you don't know if you're
    going to like the company, and it might turn out that you don't. But, it's fine
    – there's nothing to worry about. You can just say, “Okay, looks like it's not
    working for us. Let's part ways.” Right?
  sec: 620
  time: '10:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I think the biggest, scariest thing in freelancing is that you're not
    so much in control over your flow of projects. If you want to get a job, you know
    what to do. You can make a list of 50 jobs, you start applying to them in order,
    or five of the time – eventually, you're gonna get one. It's in your power. But
    when it comes to freelancing, it's not like that. Usually, the set of projects
    is kind of limited over a short period of time. So if you look out there, you'll
    see all of them, or a recruiter will tell you all of them. But if you check back
    next week, it might be a different set or not. But that's kind of it. Unless you
    have your own personal network that is coming to you, which again, they still
    come to you so it's not so much in your control. You might start feeling a little
    scared as a result.
  sec: 641
  time: '10:41'
  who: Adrian
- header: Adrian’s first projects
- line: Probably we should talk more about the personal network, but a bit later.
    Right now, I want to ask you about your first project. I think you talked a little
    bit about that – you said that your first project was to clean the legacy setup.
    Were these the kind of services you provided? Like building data pipelines, setting
    up Airflow, removing legacy? Do you remember what exactly the services were, the
    skills, the things you worked with?
  sec: 696
  time: '11:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: So I developed quite a diverse skill set before because I did end-to-end in
    startups. When you do that, you have to do everything. So I was pretty flexible,
    actually. I was more concerned about being a freelancer than the specific type
    of work, so I have to say I was quite flexible. The first work was essentially
    engineering/programming. The second project was data science. The third project
    was – actually, it was a funny one – it was helping with an ICO.
  sec: 725
  time: '12:05'
  who: Adrian
- line: I went into an office in some strange buildings to be alright with the data
    privacy laws. It was interesting. I charged double my rate because it was on short
    notice, on a Sunday. That aside, I think my third project was actually one that
    took about a year. It was building a data warehouse and later creating the team
    for an urban sports club. [cross-talk]
  sec: 725
  time: '12:05'
  who: Adrian
- line: But for this one – the one that took one year – where you were building a
    data warehouse and then the team, isn't this kind of stuff that companies usually
    have a full-time employee to take care of? Like head data or whatever.
  sec: 807
  time: '13:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think a lot of people believe the same thing. This is why I think it's not
    a great idea to be actively looking for work as a freelancer – some people already
    know that you're not the right solution, just because you're not employed or something
    like that, but other people just want to solve a problem. This is how it comes
    to be. Ultimately, if you are reliable, if you are able to deliver independently,
    if you're proactive – you will see a lot of interesting work.
  sec: 824
  time: '13:44'
  who: Adrian
- line: So I guess they didn't hire you to build the team, but eventually you just
    proved yourself to be reliable and then one project after another with this company,
    you ended up building a team for them. Is that right?
  sec: 858
  time: '14:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I pushed them, right? Because I built a data warehouse, which took two weeks.
    Then it took like three months to actually properly define what we should be looking
    at and to get everyone to agree. And then came the point “Okay, well now you're
    going to want to have someone in-house taking care of this.” So we hired the first
    people, we got some embedded analysts because now the things are consuming the
    data, training some people, and finally hired a replacement. [inaudible]
  sec: 871
  time: '14:31'
  who: Adrian
- header: Freelancing 5 years later
- line: How did your services evolve over these five years? What do you do now? Is
    it much different from what you did?
  sec: 908
  time: '15:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now it’s actually quite different. I would say my last major project
    was building a prototype – something that’s not quite production ready, I think
    it's just getting polished for production right now – of a loading framework,
    kind of like Fivetran but for a specific client (for a specific space). Now, I
    actually founded a company with two other people, one of whom I met on my previous
    project and I still do a little bit of consulting on the side. But I have a max
    capacity of one day, so I usually try to do more fun things like a little coaching.
  sec: 916
  time: '15:16'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay, so you don't actively freelance or consult right now, it only takes
    20% of your time, but you still do this. And you spent the rest of your time working
    on a product prototype, as you said, similar to Fivetran, and you also have a
    company. What does the company do?
  sec: 967
  time: '16:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: This company that we started didn't have a clear objective in the beginning.
    I think when it comes to starting companies, one of the most important things
    is to have a very high-functioning team. This is what we had, and we didn't have
    a clear idea of what we were gonna do, but we decided to do it. We ended up building
    a data pipeline for a company that one of my co-founders is invested in, which
    is Rasa.
  sec: 984
  time: '16:24'
  who: Adrian
- line: After doing this data pipeline, we realized that the core component that we
    used for building this data pipeline is essentially something that we have – all
    the data engineers have written it so many times, over and over. So what we're
    doing now is, we're actually going to release it as an open source component.
    I would guess it's about a week away from version 0.1. So don't consider that
    a launch just something we’re doing.
  sec: 984
  time: '16:24'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay. So you have a company, but at the beginning, it was more like a consultancy
    company, even though maybe you weren't doing the actual groundwork. But there
    were people who would go and do this. You are one of the founders of this company
    and one of the things you do at the company is this open source project?
  sec: 1059
  time: '17:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, right now at this company, we're just building this stuff. We don't
    have employees. We don't even have support for it. Really early.
  sec: 1082
  time: '18:02'
  who: Adrian
- header: Pay rates in freelancing
- line: Okay. [chuckle] Yeah, interesting. But let's say now, you're pretty advanced
    in your freelancing/consulting career, but back when you started, I guess one
    of the difficult things (maybe it wasn't difficult for you, I don't know, but
    it looks pretty difficult to me) is deciding how much to ask the clients. Like,
    should it be an hourly rate, should you ask for per-project pay? If it's an hourly
    rate, how much to ask for? How did you solve this problem?
  sec: 1092
  time: '18:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it was pretty easy to go hourly, partly because it was offered to
    me that way on the first contract. Then I quickly realized how amazing it is to
    work hourly, because this means you don't actually need to sit for eight hours
    in the office. Also, if you want to go after seven hours, you can go after seven
    hours – if you're fine with taking the pay cut. If you have somewhere to be for
    a few hours in a day, for whatever reason – as a freelancer, you dictate your
    availability. You're not necessarily expected to be there all the time, so it's
    way more flexible. I find that to be a better quality of life. And if I do want
    to do overtime, I get paid for it.
  sec: 1120
  time: '18:40'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay. And how did you select the rate? Did they just come to you and say,
    “Hey, this is the rate that we can offer. Take it or leave it.” Or how did that
    come about?
  sec: 1166
  time: '19:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: This was the first project, and I have to say the rate was really low. I didn't
    know that at the time. So I would say the rate that you should be charging should
    be the best one that you can get. I say that because depending on how you position
    yourself and what kind of clients you have and what kind of skill set you have,
    you might be taking as low as 60 per hour if you’re working not in Germany, let's
    say – so not for German clients.
  sec: 1177
  time: '19:37'
  who: Adrian
- line: 60 dollars?
  sec: 1206
  time: '20:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes – or euro or pounds or… it depends. But if you're a little more senior,
    if you're going on-site, if you know the people, if you don’t have a middleman,
    if it's not a corporation that has strict budget ranges and they just want to
    get stuff done and they want good talent – then you might be charging as much
    as 150 per hour.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Adrian
- line: One hundred and fifty. Okay.
  sec: 1236
  time: '20:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: The rate also very much depends on what you're brave enough to ask for. For
    a lot of people, it reflects more from their own opinion of their own value rather
    than the company.
  sec: 1237
  time: '20:37'
  who: Adrian
- line: Because I can ask for, I don't know – 500. But how many people will actually
    be willing to give me 500? I imagined that not so many, right? [chuckles]
  sec: 1249
  time: '20:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Part of the reason is simply because they think that 500 per hour is
    just unreasonable for a person, but other people just think about the value. If
    you are doing something that is special and unique, you can get paid for that.
  sec: 1261
  time: '21:01'
  who: Adrian
- header: Acquiring skills while freelancing
- line: A couple of questions ago, you mentioned that in startups you learned how
    to do things end-to-end. So you were fine doing pretty much everything. Your first
    job was engineering and programming, data engineering, and then it was data science
    and it was building a data warehouse – how did you acquire this versatile skill
    set?
  sec: 1277
  time: '21:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: By working a lot, I would say. I think it's good to always find work that
    challenges you at least a little bit. When I look for job fit in a project, I
    look to have, let's say, somewhere between 80 and 60% match on skills. This allows
    me to learn on every project. The thing is, when it comes to freelancing, people
    expect that you will not be skilled or a specialist with a specific thing that
    they're working with. So usually they do accept that you might not be great at
    the specific technology or whatever, therefore, you will have time to learn on
    the job and get paid for it. That's quite nice.
  sec: 1301
  time: '21:41'
  who: Adrian
- line: But why would they hire a freelancer to learn on the job if they can hire
    a junior to learn on the job?
  sec: 1349
  time: '22:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think a freelancer that has years of experience in both doing things and
    in learning things is going to be able to learn much quicker and apply way more
    context, and also handle things more maturely than an employee. To give you an
    idea, I view myself as an entrepreneur in what I do, not just a freelancer, because
    I need to make sure that I am getting paid, that I am getting clients, and so
    on. Sorry – I got anxiety and lost my track.
  sec: 1359
  time: '22:39'
  who: Adrian
- header: Working with recruitment agencies and networking
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah, I also don''t remember. I was checking questions on YouTube
    and I don''t remember. But maybe the other thing I wanted to ask you – I know,
    since I got contacted by agencies as well, and the way these agencies work is:
    they have some clients, they have some work, they contact me and say, “Hey, there
    is some work. Please work for our client,” and they take a cut. Right? They offer
    you X amount for an hourly rate, but they charge the client X plus 50%, for example.
    Is this how they work? As freelancers, should we work with them? Should we try
    to find clients ourselves? Is it worth talking to them?'
  sec: 1399
  time: '23:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's really up to you and how you like to work. To give you an example,
    there are multiple types of intermediaries. There could be a really big staffing
    agency like Hayes or Modis – essentially, what these guys do is just intermediate
    a transaction and you're interfacing with the client directly. This means that
    you can actually create relationships with the client and if you don't have your
    own relationships or other avenues – this is okay. It's probably one of the worst
    earning possibilities simply because these agencies often take a third of the
    project value and they do not negotiate good rates for you because they just want
    to sell the project. They don't care about your bottom line. So I would say that's
    fine if you don't have your own network – 80 per hour is still a lot.
  sec: 1450
  time: '24:10'
  who: Adrian
- line: Would you suggest to somebody who is just getting started in freelancing to
    get in touch with Hayes or some other agency and work with them first?
  sec: 1510
  time: '25:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. I think, if you want to be autonomous, that is a good way. An
    alternative for if you're just getting started would be to get in touch with smaller
    agencies as well. When it comes to smaller agencies, usually, they are expected
    to do project management as well, since they are the one selling a piece of work
    to the client. That means you need to sync with the agency and with the client.
  sec: 1521
  time: '25:21'
  who: Adrian
- line: In my experience, this is harder because now you have two different personas
    that you need to make sure you understand well, and synchronize them. It's actually
    not my favorite way. If it was up to me, I would either go with something like
    Hayes because you're completely relaxed – they do the finding for you. Or with
    my personal clients.
  sec: 1521
  time: '25:21'
  who: Adrian
- line: Your first project – was it from an agency?
  sec: 1569
  time: '26:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was from such an agency, yes.
  sec: 1574
  time: '26:14'
  who: Adrian
- line: And the second one?
  sec: 1578
  time: '26:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was from the same agency.
  sec: 1580
  time: '26:20'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay, and at which point was it not from an agency, but from your own network?
  sec: 1582
  time: '26:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I can give you a pretty simple history. This agency was actually paying
    me 60 to 70 per hour, which was quite low – even for the time. So I started looking
    on my own. At this time I had started to create a network – talk to people, to
    other freelancers, to potential clients. Essentially, at that point I was able
    to just answer to people coming back to me and ask for a higher rate. That’s when
    I stopped working with those agencies.
  sec: 1587

  who: Adrian
- line: Okay. So now you find new customers and projects without these agencies, right?
  sec: 1625
  time: '27:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. But I will say that now, the market has also changed a little bit. If
    you have ‘freelance data engineer’ in your title on LinkedIn, you will get contacted
    a lot.
  sec: 1631
  time: '27:11'
  who: Adrian
- line: So it changed in a good way. Right?
  sec: 1642
  time: '27:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: It changed in a good way, yes. I think all these data scientists that have
    been in training for the last years have finally matured as professionals on the
    job market. And there is a lot of missing engineering to support. For someone
    who is a bit more generalist, it's a wonderful time.
  sec: 1644

- line: So how do you find new customers and projects now? Through your network?
  sec: 1665
  time: '27:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Now, I actually don't look for projects so much. Right now, for example, I
    was looking for what we call a ‘design partner,’ which is somebody that works
    closely with us and with this new tool that we're building in order to help us
    find bugs and use cases. For those people, yeah, through my network. Sometimes
    it’s asking people that I've worked with before, or even if I see like a new fitting
    project.
  sec: 1671
  time: '27:51'
  who: Adrian
- line: But you said you still spend 20% of your time on consulting. How do you fill
    this 20%? Where do customers come from?
  sec: 1700
  time: '28:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: The last customer actually came from my network and it was the third time
    around. He previously came as a customer on two separate projects. It's good to
    have a network, what can I say? When you network with other freelancers, it happens
    very often. If you have a good relationship (and by good relationship, I mean
    be a decent person, I don't mean sucking up) if you're a decent person and you
    can communicate well, then you will get follow-up work quite often.
  sec: 1711
  time: '28:31'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay. That sounds simple, right? Be a decent person.
  sec: 1757
  time: '29:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Be honest and communicate directly. I think the biggest fear for people is
    that you will create problems when they bring you in. One way to create problems
    is by not communicating directly and honestly. If you do communicate, usually
    everything can be resolved.
  sec: 1762

  who: Adrian
- line: How do you tell the clients that you will not create new problems for them?
  sec: 1784
  time: '29:44'

- line: You listen. If you see that there are certain expectations and if you see
    that those expectations are at risk of not being met – I don't know, if your work
    is too slow due to whatever reasons, maybe it's you, maybe it's something else
    – communicate that ASAP. Manage expectations.
  sec: 1792
  time: '29:52'
  who: Adrian
- header: Freelancing vs consulting
- line: Another thing I wanted to ask – you started as a freelancer, but now you say
    you do consulting for 20% of the work? What is the difference? In my opinion,
    from what I understood, freelancing is more often when you do the actual work
    yourself, but consulting is when you tell others what to do? Is this a correct
    explanation?
  sec: 1816
  time: '30:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: In a way, yes. Practically, my experience has been that, by this definition,
    you're only purely a freelancer when you're coming through an agency. In any other
    situation, you're also doing the sale – So you’re consulting people, like “If
    you're in this stage, who's taking care of your stack? Then maybe you could use
    this or that.” It eventually ends up – well, now that you've told them what could
    be a solution that works, you could actually implement it for them or find something
    that can help them.
  sec: 1836
  time: '30:36'
  who: Adrian
- line: So the lines are blurry, right? You can call yourself a consultant, but do
    everything as well.
  sec: 1875
  time: '31:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I guess the distinction is that – for me right now, due to the limited amount
    of time that I can spend with a topic, I'm not going to spin up your repository
    and do any programming, because it's just not feasible for me to change between
    yet another [inaudible].
  sec: 1882
  time: '31:22'
  who: Adrian
- header: Clarity in clients’ expectations (scope of work)
- line: Yeah. We have quite a few questions. One of the questions is, “When you talk
    to a company – to a potential customer – and they tell you about the problems
    and about the use cases, do you usually get enough clarity of what they expect
    from you before taking on a project? Or is it usually more vague like “Something
    is broken, and we don't know what to do.”?”
  sec: 1903
  time: '31:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends. “Something is broken, we don't know what to do,” is also clarity.
    Then you usually can try to create a scope of work document before starting the
    work because this helps you define and manage expectations. That scope of work
    might be that we do a spike for two weeks and identify all the problems and what
    we need to do as the next steps and we agree on that. Then we reassess after two
    weeks whether we're going to continue.
  sec: 1930
  time: '32:10'
  who: Adrian
- line: What does the scope of work document look like? Is it a Google document with
    a description of a problem or something like that?
  sec: 1965
  time: '32:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean you can Google it, but the way that I do it is quite personal. I've
    gotten the feedback that it's quite specific. I like to put in as much detail
    of what goes into scope, what is not in scope, things about expectations, what
    they can expect also about working style and things like this – timelines as well.
  sec: 1975
  time: '32:55'
  who: Adrian
- line: Is it something that you can share as an example? Or maybe there are examples
    online?
  sec: 2000
  time: '33:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can share an example afterwards. I will need to analyze it.
  sec: 2007
  time: '33:27'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay, I’ll take a note to ask you about that because it looks quite interesting.
    You also said you do a spike for two weeks – for those of us who don't know what
    a spike is, can you tell us about the process?
  sec: 2012
  time: '33:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's just taking a defined amount of time to refine a problem that is not
    defined. When you have a problem and you don't know what it is, then you can't
    say if it's worth solving – it might take too long, for example. So the first
    thing you do is actually define it.
  sec: 2028
  time: '33:48'
  who: Adrian
- line: I guess here, the main message is working through iterations, right? You don't
    know what to do, you don't know what the deliverables are, what is expected of
    you, what the scope is, so you take an iteration to figure that out. Then after
    each iteration, you can see if it still makes sense to continue, to what extent
    to continue, what the scope of the next iteration will be, what the milestones
    and projects will be, and so on. Right?
  sec: 2049
  time: '34:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: With the scope of work documents, I don't know if it's worth overthinking
    it simply because my experience has been that different agencies have asked me
    for different formats. Whatever works – ultimately, it's a document that you use
    for managing expectations and one that you can refer to on a contract.
  sec: 2078
  time: '34:38'
  who: Adrian
- header: Building your network
- line: By now, I’ve understood that having a network is very important when freelancing.
    How do I go about building a network? Do I do this online and show this work online?
    Or nobody cares about online and you need to network offline?
  sec: 2101
  time: '35:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think when it comes to actually building a network – you're not really building
    a network, you're building relationships with individuals. It goes without saying
    that the best way to build a relationship with someone is actually being present
    and being there and having the opportunity to communicate in all the nonverbal
    ways. Ultimately, what needs to happen is that, at the end of the conversation,
    you know what this person needs and this person knows what you need, and they
    will remember you. Maybe two years later, they might get back to you and say,
    “Hey, you're that guy that was doing that thing? Are you available?”
  sec: 2120
  time: '35:20'
  who: Adrian
- line: So the best way to build this relationship is to show how well you work and
    then they will contact you, or maybe recommend you to their friends who need help.
    Correct?
  sec: 2159
  time: '35:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: The best thing to do is to be proactive. What I did in my first year of freelancing
    was try to have a target of meeting at least two people per week. I would write
    to people on LinkedIn and I would schedule breakfasts with them – just before
    going to work, I would ask them where they're working and find some kind of midway
    or something that works. That was a pretty quick way.
  sec: 2173
  time: '36:13'
  who: Adrian
- line: What does the message look like when you write? “Hey, let's catch up. I'm
    interested in what you're doing. I can come to the place where you live and let's
    have coffee.”?
  sec: 2199
  time: '36:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: At least from my experience, it's a good idea to express your goals – why
    do you want to meet this person? For example, I think it's important in the beginning
    to meet a lot of people that are doing the same thing that you're doing, but have
    been doing it for a year or two longer than you. This way, they have already gone
    through the steps that you will be going through and they have already established
    some sort of network. And they might actually be able to forward you some plans
    as well and help you out with advice.
  sec: 2210
  time: '36:50'
  who: Adrian
- line: The thing is, it's a win-win situation, because if you tell them what you
    need – remember, I was telling you about those percentages or fees. Freelancers
    will often charge each other a small fee, if it makes sense. For example, if it's
    my client and I sold them something, and I would like you to help me on the project,
    I might take 5 or 10%. If I'm actually managing you on the project, and I have
    to check your work, tell you what to do, and stuff like that, then I will take
    maybe 20%.
  sec: 2210
  time: '36:50'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay, so you work for a client – let's say you're building a data warehouse
    – and you see that you need help with some part of the pipeline, and you know
    somebody that you’ve met before, who has the kind of skills you're looking for.
    You just write them on LinkedIn saying, “Hey, I have this project. I need this
    kind of help. Are you free now, right?”
  sec: 2280
  time: '38:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. Personally, I keep a small core of people that I've worked
    with before and enjoyed it close. But this is how you start in the beginning.
  sec: 2303
  time: '38:23'
  who: Adrian
- line: Then in the same way, when you meet people (other freelancers) they might
    contact you. They kind of act like an agency in this case, because they will take
    a small part of your fee. But still, it's worth it. Right?
  sec: 1714
  time: '28:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: In a way. First of all, this doesn't need to always happen. Second of all,
    the relationship between freelancers and clients is usually a little different.
    When you bring another freelancer onto a project, you are kind of responsible
    in the face of the client for the outcomes. Therefore, it's okay that you do charge
    a buffer, and you might actually need to use that up if the person you hired is
    not performing.
  sec: 2330
  time: '38:50'
  who: Adrian
- line: I think it's also beneficial because a lot of new freelancers are actually
    smart, experienced people that are too afraid to ask for what they're worth. Say
    they got offers for 60 per hour from some British agency, when you could be putting
    them on a project where they will be making 100 per hour or something.
  sec: 2330

  who: Adrian

  sec: 2385
  time: '39:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think they're a waste of time, but other people have had their own experiences.
    It looks to me like the biggest pro problem, really, when you're hiring a freelancer
    is that you usually don't know what a good professional looks like. If you have
    a good relationship with a person, you will try them out and see if they're helping
    you, and if not – then not. But when you're doing this online, there is no way
    you will know. Frankly, we'll have a lot of people that are writing bullshit and
    bidding really extremely long projects and stuff for like $5 per hour for development.
  sec: 2389
  time: '39:49'
  who: Adrian
- line: Let's get real, it's not gonna work out – but the client doesn't know that.
    Because of that, you're wasting a lot of time. So I think you should always consider
    what your time is worth. Let's say you set yourself a goal for the month and say,
    “Okay, I have 170 hours. I want 100 per hour on average, so I need to make 17k.”
    Give it a shot. If you think this platform is making you that money, then you
    know that you can keep using it.
  sec: 2389
  time: '39:49'
  who: Adrian
- line: When you work with your clients, do you normally choose if you want to work
    remotely or on-site, or is it up to the client?
  sec: 2457
  time: '40:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are many projects where the client has an expectation. It's up to you
    whether you take the project or not. In my experience, if you have developed a
    network enough that you can refuse projects, you will find a remote project. All
    you need to do is say ‘no’ to the ones that want otherwise.

    Can you tell us more about this, or it's a bit too early?
  sec: 2492
  time: '41:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can tell you a little bit. But if you stay tuned, I think within a week,
    I will have this first version. The problem that I'm trying to solve is that data
    loading is hard. Why is it hard? Because it takes some engineering knowledge,
    understanding how to design good pipelines, but then you also have the problems
    that are unrelated to engineering such as data typing, unpacking data, schema
    migrations.
  sec: 2501
  time: '41:41'
  who: Adrian
- line: None of the frameworks that we currently have out there have actually solved
    this problem gracefully. What's worse, the loading frameworks that exist out there
    have a very tight coupling between the source concept and the target concept.
    This means that you need to learn the entire framework, you need to understand
    it in depth, you need to learn object-oriented programming – you need to be a
    really good software developer to be able to do a simple source and use one of
    these frameworks. So what I've been working on is a framework that makes this
    very easy.
  sec: 2501
  time: '41:41'
  who: Adrian
- line: You give it a JSON list or a JSON generator and it automatically unpacks it.
    Optionally, it types it – it generates a YAML schema that you can then manually
    edit and reuse. It uses a loading manifest, so like the merge columns, if you
    want to load incrementally. Basically, it decouples the source from the loading.
    If you are able to produce a JSON object or a Pandas data frame – it doesn't matter
    – if it's nested or whatever, this unpacker is gonna manage it, type it, rename
    the columns to something that works in the database, and then you can access it
    with SQL.
  sec: 2501
  time: '41:41'
  who: Adrian

    with? And that’s why you ended up implementing this?
  sec: 2611
  time: '43:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's something that we ended up creating because of this Rasa data pipeline
    project that we did. What happened there is – essentially the data is available
    for consumption as a conversation object. And this conversation object can be
    extremely complex because it has the entire conversation and all the technical
    actions that happen – like all the guesses the bot might make and stuff like that.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, open source chatbot company. Essentially, you don't know what you will
    find in the subject because it depends on implementation. Even the schema is not
    really fixed. So we needed a way to manage a very volatile schema, but also be
    able to freeze it if we wanted to.

- header: Going from freelancing to making your own product (and other investments)
- line: I heard that many people want to go to consulting, to freelancing, but they
    don't want to do it forever. Because here, you exchange time for money, but at
    some point, maybe you just want to get money without spending time. [chuckles]
    Is this usually what freelancers do at the end? They see a problem that is repeated
    many times, so they end up packaging it as a product and then sell it as a product?
  sec: 2668

  who: Alexey

    and approaches. Some people simply go three days a week and enjoy a richer life.
    Other people start companies, other people don't care, and just work like that.
    Other people put all their money in Bitcoin and cash out enough to retire. No
    joke. One of my mentees in freelancing did that. Yeah, every person has their
    own dreams and ambitions.

    do it again for other customers. That's going to be efficient. Because in my experience,

    you a shot. [cross-talk]

    if you want.” And typically, they will agree. Right?
  sec: 2811
  time: '46:51'
  who: Alexey

    I'm personally using it to create really good pipelines. But it's also usable
    by someone that doesn't want to create really good pipelines, but just wants to
    throw some stuff in a database. If a client wants it done commercial-grade, and
    with a nice DBT package on top of that, it has iterative [cross-talk].

  who: Alexey
- line: The question is “Who are you talking to? I think if you go through agencies
    like Hayes, then you will probably be talking to a technical person that is hiring
    you – then maybe a portfolio is useful. If you are talking directly to your clients,
    then chances are that those might be business people or people that already know

    Some projects might run a week, if it's just a small project helping someone with

    are paying you a decent enough rate – so let's say 120 multiplied by eight, that's
    like 1000 per day, multiplied by 60 for three months. So I would say 60k. If you
    live in Germany, you probably have to pay about a third of that as taxes, subtract
    health insurance, or about 10k. But that's the max if you earn 55k. You're left

    said you always wanted to leave some room for learning. In this case, do you have
    a strategy between deciding which project to take and which skills to learn next?'
  sec: 3087
  time: '51:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say I don't necessarily have a skill strategy. It's also very much
    about what I like to do. Because by being a generalist, I already have such a
    broad array of skills that finding work is not a problem. Being a specialist doesn't
    necessarily help me either find more work or do that work much better. So I really
    go by interest.
  sec: 3113
  time: '51:53'
  who: Adrian
- line: So interest can be – interest in technology, or interest in a domain, or interest
    in working with specific people, right? It doesn't matter. Okay. How can I check
    if freelancing is for me? Let's say I have a full time job and I hear this conversation
    – it all sounds nice, like working three months per year, doing all that, developing
    the product, and then selling it for millions. This is all good in my imagination,
    but how can I check if it's actually for me?
  sec: 3142
  time: '52:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can tell you about the people who probably managed freelancing successfully
    and why they failed. I think if you're that kind of person, maybe it's not the
    best option for you. There are two types of people that fail, the ones that don't
    put themselves out there because they think “Oh, it's fine, I will find the work
    when I need it.”
  sec: 3182
  time: '53:02'
  who: Adrian
- line: But you need to build a network and then this is not a deterministic action,
    like “If you do this, this will happen.” It might happen and it might not, so
    you need to keep at it. The second thing is – you definitely need to ask for a
    decent rate. If you're too afraid to ask for a good rate, if you are asking for
    the equivalent of a salary or something like that, then you will fail because
    you won't be able to make ends meet due to the added risk and occupancy rate and
    all that.
  sec: 3182
  time: '53:02'
  who: Adrian
- line: You said a good occupancy rate is 75%?
  sec: 3239
  time: '53:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 3242
  time: '54:02'
  who: Adrian
- line: So it means that you work only 75% of the year?
  sec: 3245
  time: '54:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: It means you will be working 1700 hours.
  sec: 3249
  time: '54:09'
  who: Adrian
- line: And you don't control when you work and when you don't, right? A project might
    end, it might take two weeks to find a new project. So during these two weeks,
    you're not working.
  sec: 3258
  time: '54:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. In all honesty, I've only really had downtime when we had the first Corona
    wave and everybody panicked and they cut all the contracts. [cross-talk]
  sec: 3270
  time: '54:30'
  who: Adrian
- header: Freelancing in Berlin
- line: Yeah, I think you said that the market is different right now. On the topic
    of Berlin, there is a question about Berlin – Is the market in Berlin currently
    good for freelancers in terms of pay opportunities and everything?
  sec: 3283
  time: '54:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, but you need to put yourself out there and make your own opportunities.
    If you're going to wait for the few projects that come at you, then you will compete
    with the other people who are doing the same. So unless you're as good or better
    than them, it's going to be hard. But I would say that one of the most important
    things when taking a freelancing job is to be available. I think you will find
    something.
  sec: 3297
  time: '54:57'
  who: Adrian
- header: Clients’ expectations for freelancers vs employees
- line: Okay. In terms of expectations from clients – let's say if we compare a full
    time employee from a company and a freelancer, would a company expect more from
    a freelancer in terms of being more proactive, driving decision making, coming
    up with architectural proposals, or not? Or is all of that in this ‘scope of work
    document’ that you mentioned?
  sec: 3330
  time: '55:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say that people are people, so it really depends. I'm the kind of
    person that does get involved – I just can't let it go. Other people, even as
    employees, you have to beg them to do their thing. They don't get involved, they're
    not proactive, and so on. I would say if you are a proactive person that wants
    to get stuff done, you will get access to the best clients and the best rates.
  sec: 3358
  time: '55:58'
  who: Adrian
- line: Again, just to make it clear, by proactive, you mean what? You said “putting
    yourself out there,” and by that you mean – networking with people, keeping in
    touch with past clients or what exactly?
  sec: 3392
  time: '56:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, you don't necessarily need to keep in touch with past clients. But
    yes, keep networking, maintain a healthy network, when you work, make sure you
    care. Actually care about the outcome of the project, care that it's a good outcome
    for the client – a good outcome for the client sometimes might be that the client
    is happy and not necessarily what you think is a good outcome. But if you actually
    do what people want, help them, and advise them, then they will usually find this
    so invaluable that they will want to keep working with you all the time.
  sec: 3407
  time: '56:47'
  who: Adrian
- header: Working with more than one client at the same time
- line: What do you think about working for two clients simultaneously? Does it make
    sense? Does it just happen?
  sec: 3443
  time: '57:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Some people advise you to do that simply to not put all your eggs in one basket.
    I would say – yeah, don't put all your eggs in one basket and have some savings.
    Focus is important, and if you want to do a good job, I think it's best that you
    do focus. It might also depend on you, if you have the capacity to do multiple
    clients.
  sec: 3449
  time: '57:29'
  who: Adrian
- line: I like to usually have one main client and one side client that is small enough,
    just for some extra learning or networking. Sometimes I take these small projects
    just for enlarging the network. But otherwise, I would say just focus on one.
    If you want to make the best money, just focus on one.
  sec: 3449
  time: '57:29'
  who: Adrian
- line: How does this look in practice? Let's say you spend around three days on your
    main client, one day on your other client, and one day chilling on the beach?
  sec: 3494
  time: '58:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: It could be like that. I'm not a ‘chilling on the beach’ kind of guy. If I
    go to the beach, then I'm going to be walking around for the whole day. But yeah.
  sec: 3506
  time: '58:26'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay. [chuckles] In terms of managing expectations, how do you manage expectations
    of this second client? I guess you need to tell them, “Hey, I actually have a
    primary client so everything I do for you will be a background activity for me.
    Sorry about that.”?
  sec: 3516
  time: '58:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, of course. You need to tell them ahead of time, and you need to be very
    clear. Otherwise, they will have expectations for you to answer and communicate
    in times when you won't be able to. If that happens, then you will have a problem.

- header: Adrian’s freelance cooperative on Slack
- line: Okay. I know that we should be wrapping up. I remember now that we actually
    talked in person a month ago, I think – and I was asking you about that. You said
    there is some cooperative – a freelance cooperative. Can you tell us more about
    this? What is this and how does one get in?
  sec: 3549
  time: '59:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: To get in, I will send a link to you and then you can send it further. Essentially,
    it's a Slack group that is a bunch of data freelancers that loosely cooperate.
    Some of them know each other well. We do you know this thing where we help each
    other with clients, we tell each other the projects that we find. We do take fees,
    but it's usually much smaller than what will happen outside of the group. There
    is also a little bit of a mastermind network that allows you to cooperate.
  sec: 3568
  time: '59:28'
  who: Adrian
- line: I see. Is it Germany-specific or worldwide?
  sec: 3613
  time: '1:00:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: I started with people from Berlin. I started inviting some further people,
    but I have not advertised it broadly. It's just kind of organically grown to 20-something
    people. There is more work there than we can take, usually. Definitely a good
    place for people who want to start freelancing.
  sec: 3617
  time: '1:00:17'
  who: Adrian
- header: Other advice for novice freelancers (networking)
- line: Would you say… [cross-talk] Sorry. You want to say something? Would you suggest
    that people start a similar cooperative, let's say, if they are not from Berlin
    but from some other geographical area? Would you suggest that they start like
    that?
  sec: 3641
  time: '1:00:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you are starting freelancing, I suggest starting broader. Rather than creating
    a very narrow interest group like a freelance cooperative, I would say to create
    a broader interest group – something like a BI group or a data group for your
    hometown. Meet these people, create personal relationships, and they will be your
    network.
  sec: 3659
  time: '1:00:59'
  who: Adrian
- line: Are there any networking events in Berlin that you would recommend for freelancers?
  sec: 3681
  time: '1:01:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: I wouldn't know off the top of my head, but in this group, sometimes we meet.
  sec: 3689

  who: Adrian
- header: Finding Adrian online
- line: Well, I think that's all we have time for today. There are still quite a few
    questions, both in live chat and Slido – sorry for not being able to cover all
    of them. There is a lot of interest in the topic. Thanks, Adrian, for coming today,
    for answering all these questions, for sharing your experience. And thanks, everyone,
    for joining us today and for asking questions. Maybe one last thing, actually.
    I forgot to ask, usually I ask at the end – what's the best way to get in touch
    with you? Is it LinkedIn? Is it this freelance cooperative? Email?
  sec: 3700
  time: '1:01:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. If you’re in this co-op and you want to Slack me – Slack is going to
    be faster. But I'm checking LinkedIn quite regularly, when I can.
  sec: 3735
  time: '1:02:15'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay, thanks. I accidentally forgot to ask this at the end. But again, thanks
    for joining us today. I guess that will be it.
  sec: 3745
  time: '1:02:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. Have a nice weekend. Maybe keep in mind too – if you go to my LinkedIn,
    there's actually a link to the GitHub account. If all goes well, in one week,
    you will find this loading tool.
  sec: 3755
