transcript:
- line: This week, we will talk about career transitioning from data analytics to
    data science. We have a special guest today, Andrada. Andrada worked for two and
    a half years as a data analyst. Then she decided to make a career switch and she
    became a data scientist. Today, she will share her experience with us. Welcome.

  who: Alexey
- line: Hello, everybody. I am super glad I could join. I hope you are going to get
    something interesting from this.
  sec: 122

  who: Andrada
- header: "Andrada\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go into our main topic, so let us start with your background. Can
    you tell us a bit more about your career journey so far?
  sec: 130
  time: '2:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I did my undergrad in statistics. During that time, I wanted to get
    a little bit of domain knowledge hands-on. I was a data analyst at Avon Cosmetics
    in my country, in Bucharest, Romania. Afterwards, I did a Masters in Data Science
    Analytics in the UK. During that time, I found my passion on Kaggle. Afterwards,
    I came back and I started working at Endava as a data scientist. That is about
    it.

  time: '2:21'
  who: Andrada
- line: Now you are in Bucharest?
  sec: 182
  time: '3:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I am in Bucharest. It is super sunny and I am super excited about it.
  sec: 185
  time: '3:05'
  who: Andrada
- line: Does it often happen that you have sun?
  sec: 190
  time: '3:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but in the UK, it was not the case.
  sec: 192
  time: '3:12'
  who: Andrada
- line: You were studying statistics, you were working in data analytics. How did
    you realize that you want to go into data science?
  sec: 198
  time: '3:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It was a multitude of factors. The main reason was a girl in my statistics\
    \ class who was talking obsessively about data science. I was a data analyst and\
    \ I was doing my thing and I liked it. I liked it a lot actually, but she was\
    \ talking a lot about data science. I was also watching some machine learning\
    \ articles. I was like, \u201COkay, what is this?\u201D It was so confusing to\
    \ me. Afterwards, I started researching. During that time, I also knew I wanted\
    \ to do a Masters. Because I already was working at Avon and I was a data analyst,\
    \ I was like, \u201Cokay, I want to do a Master's a little bit deeper, not on\
    \ what I already know.\u201D  Then I will start doing data science. Because I\
    \ wanted to get ahead and not be a super noob when I went into that Masters, I\
    \ did not know how hard it was going to be, I started some courses on my own \u2014\
    \ on basics of data science. Then I discovered how fantastic that is, and I started\
    \ enjoying it more and more. Because I felt like I already knew some data analytics,\
    \ although it might not be the case, I went into data science full-on and I have\
    \ been doing it since then."
  sec: 212
  time: '3:32'
  who: Andrada
- header: Recommended courses
- line: Do you remember which courses you took?
  sec: 321
  time: '5:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, very vividly. The first thing that introduced me to data science \u2014\
    \ and I highly recommend it to anybody who did not do Python, who does not know\
    \ about machine learning. I only knew about regressions because I did them in\
    \ statistics, linear regressions. I highly recommend the \u201CPython for Data\
    \ Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp\u201D on Udemy. It is from Jose Portilla.\
    \ He is absolutely amazing. He did these courses so nicely and he teaches you\
    \ \u2014 okay, this is anaconda, this is how you start a notebook. Let us start\
    \ with Python. Now I am going to explain to you some Pandas and some NumPy. Okay,\
    \ now what is linear regression? Now I know you did not come only for a linear\
    \ regression, so take some random forest or decision trees and so on. At that\
    \ moment I understood what data science is and I had my foundation. Afterwards\
    \ you can build on whatever you want. But that was the foundation I really needed."
  sec: 323
  time: '5:23'
  who: Andrada
- line: Did you do this course during your undergrad studies in statistics or something
    later during your Masters?
  sec: 408
  time: '6:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: I did them before my Masters. It was the summer before my Masters. I was still
    working but I wanted to prepare a little bit.
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Andrada
- line: "So, there was a girl in your class and she told you \u201Cokay, there is\
    \ this thing\u201D. You started to read more and more about that. Then you finally\
    \ found that course on Udemy and you did that course and you understood \u201C\
    okay, this is a super cool thing\u201D. Then you decided \u201Cokay, I want to\
    \ spend more time doing that\u201D and you decided to go and do a Masters."
  sec: 427
  time: '7:07'
  who: Alexey
- header: Kaggle and StackOverflow
- line: "I guess Kaggle was a big factor as well. It is the community and the comments\
    \ and the medals. And the fact that you can interact with somebody. You post on\
    \ StackOverflow\u2026  once I posted and they downvoted my post because it was\
    \ like, \u201Coh, you did not put the question right\u201D, although I put a disclaimer\
    \ there \u201CI have not done this before, sorry\u201D. I have never asked a question\
    \ on StackOverflow again. Whereas on Kaggle, you can just ask and people are so\
    \ nice. Kaggle was a big factor as well."
  sec: 451
  time: '7:31'
  who: Andrada
- line: How did you discover Kaggle? You were doing this bootcamp course on Udemy.
    Did you find Kaggle after the course, during it, or during your Masters? Or when?
  sec: 498
  time: '8:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: "My first interaction with Kaggle was... Somebody told me [about it] during\
    \ my undergrad studies. And I entered. I did not understand anything, what was\
    \ going on\u2026 This is a spaceship, I am out. Afterwards \u2014 and this is\
    \ why I am saying this was a big foundation \u2014  during that Udemy course,\
    \ at some point or towards the end, he was like, \u201Cyou can practice more on\
    \ Kaggle\u201D. I was like, \u201Coh, okay\u201D. I remember that spaceship I\
    \ was so frightened about. So, I naturally went into Kaggle\u2026 I knew it was\
    \ complicated. I did not want to do anything with it, just the courses. Give me\
    \ the courses. I want to understand more and more. Afterwards, because they tease\
    \ you from the courses into a competition, I entered the world. This is how it\
    \ happened."
  sec: 512
  time: '8:32'
  who: Andrada
- line: And what happened then?
  sec: 578
  time: '9:38'
  who: Alexey
- header: Doing notebooks on Kaggle
- line: "Then, I did not even understand what I was doing\u2026 I did not even understand\
    \ what I was doing when I was sharing the notebook. I remember the only thing\
    \ I wanted to do was to improve my model. It was Iowa House Price Prediction which\
    \ is the natural progression from the machine learning courses on Kaggle \u2014\
    \ which are, by the way, absolutely amazing and are, in my opinion, were best\
    \ after that course on Udemy. Because I had my foundation, but then I found out\
    \ how to put some new questions to improve my models and make them better."
  sec: 583
  time: '9:43'
  who: Andrada
- line: "I started trying to improve the models. Then, because I wanted to understand\
    \ more, I learned visualization. Now I am going to do a notebook on visualization.\
    \ My only purpose of doing the notebooks was just to use the data sets on Kaggle.\
    \ They were interesting to practice my skills that I wanted to gain on Kaggle.\
    \ I was not posting to gain medals or something. I did this notebook, which is\
    \ highly appreciated, although I do not understand why \u2014 because it is so\
    \ basic."
  who: Andrada
- line: Maybe that is why. It is basic and simple and people can just open it and
    understand what is going on. I remember that on Kaggle, sometimes there is a notebook
    that gives you a good score, but you have no idea what is going on.
  sec: 684
  time: '11:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is for smart people, very very smart people.
  sec: 703
  time: '11:43'
  who: Andrada
- line: "Maybe that is why \u2014 because it is so simple. People can understand and\
    \ relate and really follow through and see what is going on and learn from this.\
    \ So, you took some courses on Kaggle. Then they teased you to try competitions.\
    \ The competition was about predicting prices for houses, and you did a notebook\
    \ there and it became popular?"
  sec: 707
  time: '11:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No. That one has 20 upvotes after one year and a half or something. No. But,\
    \ in my opinion, it was pretty good. I jumped, I became obsessed on the leaderboard\
    \ and I jumped at some point after some hardcore hyper parameter tuning. I remember\
    \ I stayed one day, nine hours straight. That is why I put parameter tuning. It\
    \ was so exciting, because the error was dropping. I was like, \u201COh, my God\u201D\
    . I remember, I went to the top five percent or three percent or something. It\
    \ was super addictive."
  sec: 738
  time: '12:18'
  who: Andrada
- line: "But what happened afterwards, I started to try to gain more knowledge on\
    \ multiple things. I remember, I did not have any knowledge on Pandas and how\
    \ to manage data frames. It was taking me a lot of time to do anything. Visualizations,\
    \ everything. It was taking me a long time because I was a beginner. I did that\
    \ Brazil Fires analysis, which was just that. It was the moment when there was\
    \ that problem in the world. Also I wanted to experience on a data set that I\
    \ was passionate about. That one, that notebook, I remember, I did summer in September\
    \ last year. I never went to Kaggle until late October \u2014 I was doing my Masters.\
    \ When I went back to Kaggle, although I already had like two or three notebooks\
    \ and no upvotes whatsoever. How do people get these? I do not understand. I had\
    \ the silver medal or something, that was it. Do people see this? What? And that\
    \ is when actually everything started."
  who: Andrada
- header: Projects for learning data science
- line: "We talked quite a lot about Kaggle. As I understood, that was one of the\
    \ main drivers for your learning. You picked up Pandas, some other data wrangling\
    \ skills, visualization, exploratory data analysis. When you learn something \u2014\
    \ the important thing is to do projects. Would you say that for you, the projects\
    \ that you did to learn data science were mostly coming from Kaggle or you also\
    \ did some other projects to learn it?"
  sec: 866
  time: '14:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: 90 percent of them came from Kaggle, the other 10 percent were my dissertation.
    A few other projects that I had in my Masters and then I translated them. Two
    of them, I actually translated them into Kaggle. So, still Kaggle.
  sec: 905
  time: '15:05'
  who: Andrada
- line: How did you translate them? You were writing your thesis, you said. How did
    you put this to Kaggle, just uploaded your notebooks there?
  sec: 932
  time: '15:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not really, because some of them were data sensitive. For example, I had this
    amazing module in my Masters that was hands-on and we had three projects. Two
    of them were in teams. We would change teams after each project, which was exhausting.
    But they wanted to push us to interact with as many people as possible. The last
    one was solo. What happened, from the first project, it was on audio files. That
    project, I use heavily in the birth call competition on Kaggle.
  sec: 942
  time: '15:42'
  who: Andrada
- line: "The second one was on fraud detection. The data they used was from Kaggle\
    \ but they altered it a little bit. What I did was I just translated what I have\
    \ done in that fraud detection challenge, to Kaggle using the data set on Kaggle.\
    \ So not the one they provided. The last one\u2026  I cannot even remember what\
    \ the project was about. Oh, the fraud detection was the last one. The one in\
    \ between was the one with sensitive data that I could not use. It was super on\
    \ optimization, it was super complicated. For my dissertation, I did sentiment\
    \ analysis on the bike sharing scheme in Belfast. I was in Belfast and I learned\
    \ so many interesting things."
  who: Andrada
- line: "What I did is after I finished\u2026 I remember the person who actually hired\
    \ me, who is a grandmaster as well on Kaggle, Gabi Preda\u2026 Shout out to Gabi\
    \ Preda. He is absolutely amazing. He texted me on LinkedIn and he said, \u201C\
    have you seen that dataset on Covid\u2019s tweets?\u201D. I was like, \u201Cyeah\u201D\
    . \u201CDo you want to do a sentiment analysis on it?\u201D. And I was like, \u201C\
    Oh, yeah!\u201D. Then I translated  everything I learned in my dissertation to\
    \ a fun, interactive Kaggle notebook on that data set."
  who: Andrada
- header: "Finding a job and a mentor with Kaggle\u2019s help"
- line: So, you found a job because somebody from Kaggle reached you? What was the
    name?
  sec: 1089
  time: '18:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Gabi Preda.
  sec: 1103
  time: '18:23'
  who: Andrada
- line: So, he found you on Kaggle?
  sec: 1104
  time: '18:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think it was more from me than from him. Kaggle was full of opportunities\
    \ for me. When I started, I never realized it. This is why I encourage every time...\
    \ And I think people are getting bored of it. If you listen to talks from me,\
    \ I am a Kaggle maniac. Just because it brought me so many opportunities. My job\
    \ was one of them. What happened is at first, when I started doing Kaggle, I was\
    \ not used to any Romanian names. When I found the rankings, it took me half a\
    \ year\u2026 Kaggle is super complex. I guess I was not curious enough. When I\
    \ went into rankings, I wanted to take a look at people, especially from the top,\
    \ and follow them."
  sec: 1112
  time: '18:32'
  who: Andrada
- line: "I recommend this to everybody \u2014 follow people on Kaggle, on LinkedIn,\
    \ on Twitter or on anything. If they are in the top 200 people, it means that\
    \ they are super passionate. It might be that you have something to learn from\
    \ them. When I saw the top five or six or something, a Romanian name, I was shocked,\
    \ I was like, \u201COh, we can do this too? What?\u201D I followed him. I was\
    \ super chill, I did not text him or anything. I was a contributor at that time.\
    \ I do not know how he remarked me, but at some point, he followed me back and\
    \ he left me a super sweet comment, super genuine comment on one of my notebooks,\
    \ it was a sentiment analysis or Rick and Morty tweets, which is one of my favorites.\
    \ He left a comment there and I remember I was so excited. I was super happy about\
    \ it."
  who: Andrada
- line: "Afterwards, when I realized I wanted to come back to Bucharest, when I started\
    \ searching for jobs, I texted him as well. I would also recommend this to anybody,\
    \  because finding a job, you need to apply to 100 to get back five responses.\
    \ And maybe one is going to say \u201Cyes\u201D. I would recommend to text to\
    \ anybody. I knew he was elite\u2026 Gabi, I hope you are not listening to me."
  who: Andrada
- line: I really really wanted a mentor. The data science field is changing a lot,
    fast. You cannot be a person that is not open to change to be a good data scientist.
    Because if you are using BERT today, in two years it is going to be obsolete.
    Maybe BERT is not a good example but just simple vanilla neural networks, they
    are not used anymore. You use more complex algorithms. Or you are not using regression,
    you are using XGBoost or random forest or whatever. So, you need a person who
    is open, who likes it, who reads, who is passionate about data science. And I
    knew he was, just because he was active on Kaggle. He liked it. I saw him, he
    had an interest in it.
  who: Andrada
- line: "So, I was thinking that I really wanted to find a job... It was not the job\
    \ I was looking for, it was a person that would teach me things. I had a lot of\
    \ interviews with people that I did not\u2026 I could have gone further but I\
    \ just stopped them \u2014 just because I knew if I get this job, I will not like\
    \ this person and I will not be able to work with him. Yeah, so I found Gabi on\
    \ Kaggle. I am super lucky that he saw opportunity in me and I am super grateful\
    \ for that."
  who: Andrada
- header: The process for looking for a job
- line: Maybe we can talk a bit about this process for looking for a job. You said
    that you need to apply for 100 positions to get just one job offer. For you, how
    many jobs did you apply to?
  sec: 1405
  time: '23:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It was not 100, because it took me a long time. It depends a lot. You do\
    \ not need to go into looking for a job thinking that it is going to take me a\
    \ long time, because it might not. But in my case\u2026 To give you a comparison,\
    \ I am the struggling one, usually. I had another colleague in my Masters, she\
    \ is super smart. She found the job much quicker. I started looking for a job\
    \ in June and it took me until October to get the proposition. She, on the other\
    \ hand, started looking in the beginning of August and in late August, she already\
    \ told me she was having an offer. So, it depends. It is hard. You are looking\
    \ at other people and maybe they are more lucky. But you need to be resilient.\
    \ I did not apply to 100 jobs just because\u2026 I remember I was having a habit.\
    \ Every Friday, I would stay for two or three hours to apply. I could not find\
    \ 100 jobs to apply to because it was Covid."
  sec: 1421
  time: '23:41'
  who: Andrada
- line: "I was trying in Bucharest which is a metropolitan area, it is the capital\
    \ of Romania. I was also trying other countries \u2014 to be remote. There were\
    \ not many positions for a junior data scientist. Everybody looks for a junior\
    \ data scientist with a senior knowledge but the salary of a traineeship. I did\
    \ not fit. It took me a while and I had many rejections as well, which hurt."
  who: Andrada
- header: Main difficulties of getting a job
- line: Sorry to hear. What were the main difficulties for you? You said you started
    in June and you found it in October. So it took five months.
  sec: 1567
  time: '26:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 1578
  time: '26:18'
  who: Andrada
- line: "What were the main difficulties for you in this process? Is it a lot of competition\
    \ or just people do not want to hire juniors to work remotely or\u2026?"
  sec: 1579
  time: '26:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: "The main difficulty, and it still is a big difficulty for me is the coding\
    \ part. In all the interviews I had \u2014 besides the one for Endava, with Gabby\
    \ \u2014 all the other interviews I had were testing me on algorithmic coding.\
    \ I had an interview for this company, I am not going to name it just because\
    \ it does not matter, and my partner was having an interview exactly for the same\
    \ company. I was having it for Romania but he was having it for London. It does\
    \ not matter but it was the same company. And we had a part of one day. He had\
    \ a coding interview and I also had a technical interview, not really a coding.\
    \ He is in cyber security. He had an easier algorithm than I had, which I was\
    \ applying for a data scientist. I was like, \u201Cwhat is happening?\u201D"
  sec: 1587
  time: '26:27'
  who: Andrada
- line: "When they tell you, \u201COkay, try to solve this\u201D, and they watch you\u2026\
    \ And I am like, \u201CI have no idea what you are telling me, can we please talk\
    \ about data sets, can we please talk about projects?\u201D I was struggling a\
    \ lot just because I was doing a lot of algorithmic coding online with exercises\
    \ which I hate. I genuinely hate because these are interviews, whereas for Endava\
    \ I just had a normal conversation. They already knew that I knew data science\
    \ and I know \u2014 at least roughly \u2014 how to code because of my projects\
    \ on Kaggle. The only thing we were talking about \u201DOkay, how would you solve\
    \ this problem? What about this? What projects have you been working on? How did\
    \ you solve it?\u201D So, it was not \u201CI am going to see if you know this\
    \ algorithm that you need to know by heart or I am not going to hire you\u201D\
    ."
  who: Andrada
- line: "So, most of the interviews were of this sort\u2026 One famous example I often\
    \ got in the past was \u2014 you have a string with opening and closing brackets\
    \ and you need to find out if it is balanced or not balanced. This kind of stuff\
    \ that you do not need at work at all. It is more like a brain teaser. So I guess\
    \ most of the interviews, they were asking for these kind of things."

  time: '29:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: "They put me to create a class that would receive a\u2026 I am trying to remember\
    \ the problem correctly. It is a popular one, if you try to find it on Google,\
    \ you will find it, but I cannot remember the name. It is the thing that you have\
    \ a tree and on any node you give, you want to get the other nodes that have the\
    \ same neighbors. It was something like that. And I do not even work with classes.\
    \ I usually do not. If you know a few examples, you can make them, but I was like,\
    \ \u201CI have no idea how to\u2026 can you\u2026?\u201D So, it was very difficult\
    \ for me. Usually you finish these interviews negatively impacted, being like,\
    \ \u201Coh, I am super stupid, I should not be doing this, I should not be doing\
    \ this\u201D. Nut it is not true."

  who: Andrada
- line: "The other interview that I had, it was for Pandas. But they did not let me\
    \ google, which I think is something stupid as well. Because you google a lot\
    \ at work. It was on Pandas but they put me to do this weird long multiple pandas\
    \ functions to get something, a filtering of some sorts from a table. I managed\
    \ to get almost to the end. And I remember the guy being like, \u201Coh, no, you\
    \ should know this, this is super simple\u201D. When they tell you it is super\
    \ simple, you are feeling more stupid. In my opinion, they are not realistic."

    \ you are super passionate about Kaggle and the community there \u2014 you have\
    \ visibility there, people know you, people see your notebooks, people see what\
    \ you do there. For people in the community, they recognize you, and it helps\
    \ to get a job. I guess this was one of the factors how you managed to eventually\
    \ get that one offer then from this company."
