- header: Becoming a meme-generating machine
- line: Before we start, I would like to ask you about your background. Anyone who
    follows you on LinkedIn knows that you're a meme-generating machine. Every time
    I open my LinkedIn feed, I see a meme from you. And it's awesome. I want to know,
    how do you get inspiration for them? It must be difficult to create so many memes.
    How do you do that?
  sec: 49
  time: 0:49
  who: Alexey
- line: The inspiration for my memes mostly comes from things that I've experienced
    in real life. Whether it's someone doing some dodgy practices with data science,
    or they're looking to try and trick some management by telling them something,
    or whatever it is. I try and draw on my own experiences to poke a little bit of
    fun. Everyone knows that the funniest memes are always based on truth. Usually,
    I need to think about things that I've done in the past, or I've seen people do
    incorrectly in data science. And things just come to my brain.
  sec: 81
  time: '1:21'
  who: Danny
- line: You must have seen quite a few things that people did incorrectly.
  sec: 118
  time: '1:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: I believe so.
  sec: 122
  time: '2:02'
  who: Danny
- line: If you came here because you saw a post from Danny, you probably saw the video
    that he made. I still cannot unsee this video. I will include a link in the comments.
    Be careful. Once you look at this, this image will stay in your head. It will
    not go away for a couple of days. Believe me. How did you learn to do these things?
    This is not something that an average data scientist can do.

  time: '2:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I'd call it \u201Ccreative video editing\u201D. I spent too much time on\
    \ social media consuming lots of different content. I feel that I've developed\
    \ a strong intuition for what is interesting, or at least what is different. I\
    \ just try and do the video editing to make it happen. I'm still very junior when\
    \ it comes to video editing. I have a friend who actually works for the Australian\
    \ Broadcasting Company. He always tells me \u201CI should give you some lessons\
    \ on how to edit properly.\u201D I have no idea what I'm doing."

  who: Danny
- line: This is amazing. Was it Sesame Street? This is pretty much on topic to our
    discussion today.
  sec: 201
  time: '3:21'
  who: Alexey
- header: "Danny\u2019s background"
- line: On a more serious note, maybe you can tell us about your career, apart from
    the most useful skills you have that we already talked about. It would be quite
    interesting to know, what was your career journey so far?
  sec: 213
  time: '3:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: "My name is Danny Ma. I would call myself a \u201Crecovering data scientist\u201D\
    . I've spent the past five years working in data science. But I actually started\
    \ off my career working in data analytics, specifically in campaign analytics.\
    \ I was the one trying to identify which customers to send different emails, based\
    \ on their shopping behavior. I did that for two years. It was my first job out\
    \ of university. For university, I took an undergrad in commerce, majoring in\
    \ actuarial studies. That's the maths and the statistics behind the insurance\
    \ models and financial models. I don't think I actually remember much from my\
    \ university days. I learned almost everything on the job instead. When I was\
    \ at university, I was too busy partying or doing something crazy."
  sec: 231
  time: '3:51'
  who: Danny
- line: "As part of my studies, I managed to get a few internships working for insurance\
    \ companies. This was in the actuarial department where they would have lots of\
    \ crazy Excel. They used a lot of SAS \u2014 statistical and analysis software\
    \ \u2014 to model the claims and different things like that within the insurance\
    \ world. They didn't let me anywhere near it. I didn\u2019t learn much when I\
    \ was doing my internships. But I got exposure to some of the data stuff there.\
    \ I also realized that I didn't want to work within the insurance space. I wanted\
    \ to do something a little bit different, maybe like a non-traditional use of\
    \ data."
  sec: 296
  time: '4:56'
  who: Danny
- line: That drew me towards my first role outside of university, which was with Quantium,
    a data consulting firm within Australia. There I did campaign and retail analytics
    as well. Think of consumer packaged goods and different things that you can buy
    in a supermarket. I did that for two years. I stagnated a little bit, and I wanted
    to find a more challenging thing to do. Around a year and a half into my role
    there, I started waking up at 5am to learn Python. I had very little programming
    experience before that. I dabbled with a little bit of R when I was at university.
  who: Danny
- line: What did you use as an analyst? SQL?
  sec: 392
  time: '6:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Most of it was SQL and Excel. I used SAS because that was the only thing they
    gave us in that company. I was automating a lot of SQL jobs through whatever tools
    I could get my hands on. But my SQL code back then was very, very bad. It must
    have been not optimized at all. I had no idea what I was doing.
  sec: 395
  time: '6:35'
  who: Danny
- line: "After I spent my time learning a bit of Python, I asked some of my mentors,\
    \ \u201CWhat do I do? I don't feel like doing this campaign stuff much longer\u201D\
    . They told me \u201CYou should do data science\u201D. Back then I had no idea\
    \ what data science was. I googled \u201Cdata science\u201D. And I started with\
    \ Kaggle, trying to do different things. I made almost every mistake that every\
    \ new data scientist would have made on their career and their journey."
  who: Danny
- line: "Then I applied for a few data science roles. I didn't have any experience\
    \ and I got rejected for all of them. I eventually made it into a role with the\
    \ bank \u2014 one of Australia's largest banks within the digital area. I was\
    \ doing more along the same lines of what I was doing before but in a different\
    \ space. Think of all the campaign targeting and looking at the different click\
    \ funnels and different things like that on their website."
  who: Danny
- line: The same thing, but this time with Python?
  sec: 490
  time: '8:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: This time I tried using Python, but it was not very good.
  sec: 493
  time: '8:13'
  who: Danny
- line: So, SQL again?
  sec: 497
  time: '8:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Mostly SQL. But we had an opportunity to apply data science to some of the\
    \ problems within that digital space. I got to work hand-in-hand with the data\
    \ science team. After that project, I got absorbed into the data science team.\
    \ That was around when I became a data scientist \u2014 by title only."
  sec: 499
  time: '8:19'
  who: Danny
- line: Which year was it?
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: It must have been 2016.
  sec: 526
  time: '8:46'
  who: Danny
- line: Still around the time when companies had no clue what data science is?
  sec: 533
  time: '8:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think so. Things haven't really changed much...
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Danny
- line: Yes, exactly.
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: "After I moved into the data science team, I started working on more traditional\
    \ machine learning projects. Think of all the customer propensity modeling, looking\
    \ at time series, forecasting. We actually did a lot of experimentation as well.\
    \ It was still within the campaign and the marketing space, but it was much more\
    \ rigorous in terms of how you would run the experiments and how you examine the\
    \ results \u2014 with all the statistical testing and target/control groups. I\
    \ spent a lot of time doing that."
  sec: 546
  time: '9:06'
  who: Danny
- line: Towards the end of my three years in the data science team at the bank, I
    started working more in data assets. It was more of an exploratory data role.
    But I would also be implementing the final data products that we were using across
    the different teams. One of my big things was to try and capture customer interactions
    around the bank. Imagine someone takes out some money at an ATM. They use their
    card to pay for a coffee down the road. Then they make a complaint on the website,
    because something happened with their transaction. I'd be able to track all of
    that at a customer level and draw it on a timeline so people can start analyzing
    the journeys. We were using all of those events to create massive feature sets
    and machine learning training data. We were using that quite often.
  sec: 585
  time: '9:45'
  who: Danny
- line: "Soon after I built that product, I got an opportunity to do the same thing,\
    \ but at a retailer. This time I was doing it on the cloud with more digital data\
    \ sources \u2014 Google ads, Facebook ads, Instagram as well as all their shopping\
    \ data and whatever else they had at a customer level. We got to build that in\
    \ GCP. It was a really great project. It was quite challenging. The team used\
    \ that data to build multi-touch multi-channel digital attribution models. My\
    \ last projects were around that space, where it was all about combining data,\
    \ automating machine learning pipelines and doing everything on the cloud."
  who: Danny
- header: ABC of data science
- line: "We will talk about these ABCs a bit later, but you captured at least two\
    \ of them \u2014 A and B. Let's take a step back and talk about these different\
    \ types of data scientists."
  sec: 689
  time: '11:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: The topic today is the ABC of data science. What are these ABCs? I'm also
    curious how you came up with this idea?
  sec: 720
  time: '12:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "There's an article written from a data science team at Airbnb. They defined\
    \ two types of data scientists: type A \u2014 the analyst type, and a Type B \u2014\
    \ the building type. Last year, when I was doing my live streams on YouTube, I\
    \ added an extra element of Type C. It\u2019s a combination of both, but more\
    \ within the management realm. The A and the B were already there, I took them\
    \ and talked about them a little bit deeper and then I added the C. I haven't\
    \ seen other people talk about the C as of it yet, but we'll see. Someone might\
    \ claim it."
  sec: 738
  time: '12:18'
  who: Danny
- header: "Type A \u2014 the Analyst"
- line: "You can say, \u201CI was actually first. Here's my video\u201D. Let's talk\
    \ about these A and B and C. What are those?"
  sec: 787
  time: '13:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Type A stands for Analyst, B stands for Builder. When we think of the analyst\
    \ type, it\u2019s something similar to the experience I had. I came in doing a\
    \ lot of data analysis, being able to look at insights, do data visualization,\
    \ make some dashboards, and try and figure out what's going on with the data.\
    \ That's a very large component of data science. We can't really be doing machine\
    \ learning if we don't know what\u2019s the problem that we're solving. A lot\
    \ of the upfront work and the investment of time and energy for many of the projects\
    \ will be done on analyzing data and making sure that we're solving the right\
    \ problem."
  sec: 797
  time: '13:17'
  who: Danny
- line: "The analyzing type is coming from a data analytics background, maybe with\
    \ a statistics background, very research-heavy as well. It\u2019s the origins\
    \ of the first few data scientists that ever appeared in Silicon Valley. This\
    \ was the first time that the term was being used. They brought on PhDs, ex-PhDs,\
    \ ex-researchers from all the powerful universities like MIT, Stanford, they put\
    \ them into their teams in LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google. They were there to\
    \ do research and try to figure out where they should invest money or how they\
    \ can use the data to build a new product that will help the customer experience.\
    \ You ended up getting things like the Facebook Knowledge Graph, the LinkedIn\
    \ Network Graph. I think Google PageRank was one of the original large scale machine\
    \ learning products as well. So when we think of the analyst type, they were that\
    \ type of people. They come from a very heavy research background."
  who: Danny
- header: Background for the type A
- line: As I understood, data science type A is not necessarily a data analyst. This
    is a different role. The first data scientists ever who appeared, they were of
    this type. The other types followed after that. What kind of background do they
    usually have? PhD, people who are doing research? Is it the only type of background
    they have? Or are there some other backgrounds?
  sec: 922
  time: '15:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: "The originals were mostly coming from that strong technical pedigree of having\
    \ all the training, doing a lot of research, and writing quite a lot of code.\
    \ Over time the companies realized that these people were really rare.  Most of\
    \ them were very happy to continue doing research, instead of moving into the\
    \ industry. A lot of the other people who are working with data originally \u2014\
    \ your traditional analysts, your quants, maybe some of the database people as\
    \ well \u2014 they started converging onto this role of \u201Cdata scientist.\u201D\
    \ Most of them came from that analytical background. They were very good with\
    \ the data. It made perfect sense for them to slot in and start picking up some\
    \ of the other skills that those advanced PhD researchers were already using."
  sec: 961
  time: '16:01'
  who: Danny
- line: "This could have been Python, R \u2013 all those different languages, which\
    \ are additional on top of the traditional data analyst skillset of using SQL,\
    \ Excel, Tableau, data visualization tools. It was most of the background of the\
    \ people. Their actual study background didn't matter so much, it was more about\
    \ their work experience. You still have people who are doing technical degrees\
    \ \u2014 computer science degrees and statistics and mathematical degrees \u2014\
    \ that would also slot into the A type. They blend in with the B type, which we'll\
    \ cover soon."
  who: Danny
- line: 'The skills the type A data scientists need: first, how to program with Python,
    or R. Then they need to know the theory. Usually they were originally coming from
    these big famous universities. They need to know the theory of machine learning,
    how to experiment, statistics, designing an experiment and things like this. Is
    there something else that they also need to know?'
  sec: 1058
  time: '17:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: "The analyst types also have to present a lot of their insights to the business.\
    \ This also ties in with the Type C data scientists who specialize in communication.\
    \ When you're doing a lot of analysis, even as a data analyst, you're expected\
    \ to present your findings to the business \u2014 to drive a commercial decision\
    \ or to drive some direction in the project. So communication is also very important.\
    \ But to round out the skill sets for the type A data scientist \u2014 most of\
    \ is essentially a data analyst plus additional bits and pieces that come from\
    \ the research background, a bit of programming, and more emphasis on the communication\
    \ than before."
  sec: 1100
  time: '18:20'
  who: Danny
- header: Learning path for Type A
- line: Analysts are already good at this storytelling and visualization. They need
    to add a bit of coding on top of that. And if they don't know theory, they also
    need to study more statistics. Usually, data analysts already know a bit of statistics,
    they need to learn a bit more, right? And also learn a bit of machine learning.
  sec: 1151
  time: '19:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let's say we have a typical data analyst who knows how to write SQL queries,
    who knows how to create dashboards, who knows how to do nice data visualization.
    They want to become the type A data scientist. What will the learning path look
    like for them?
  who: Alexey
- line: "That was exactly my path. When I started my journey into data science, I\
    \ could do SQL (very badly), Excel, dashboarding, a little bit of R. But I had\
    \ no idea what the other skills were. A lot of my journey was essentially just\
    \ trying to figure out what I should learn. I got that direction when I started\
    \ working with people who were in a data science role and had data science experience.\
    \ They could guide me on what I should be learning. That was when I saw my own\
    \ growth and development really pick up like a hockey stick. I felt that before\
    \ I had that guidance, I was fumbling around in the dark, reading a lot of different\
    \ articles and being stretched everywhere. You hear like, \u201CYou need to understand\
    \ all the theory before you even start doing any programming.\u201D And then someone\
    \ else would say, \u201CNo, you implement machine learning things, and then you\
    \ pick up the theory.\u201D"
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Danny
- line: That's what I say usually.
  sec: 1266
  time: '21:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That\u2019s what I would say as well. Go and try a few things. You'll know\
    \ when you need to learn the theory \u2014 when you'd have no idea what's going\
    \ on. That was the same advice given to me. I would say for anyone who's working\
    \ with data, visualizing and whatever, there's definitely a path into data science.\
    \ You have to be curious. Keep working on it. Work with strong mentors who can\
    \ give you that level of guidance to push you in the right direction."
  sec: 1268
  time: '21:08'
  who: Danny
- header: Becoming curious
- line: "How can we formalize this \u201Cbeing curious\u201D? Let's say you're trying\
    \ to put a learning plan. You put Python there, you put machine learning theory\
    \ there, you put some other things. And then the last point is \u201CI have to\
    \ be curious\u201D. How can somebody become curious? Or this is something intrinsic\
    \ that you cannot control?"
  sec: 1314
  time: '21:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: "There's a spectrum of curiosity. A lot of people need to know what's going\
    \ on to the Nth degree. I've met people who wanted to do data science. They started\
    \ learning Python. Then they wanted to figure out how the Python code got translated\
    \ into some compiled and into binary code \u2013 something crazy like that. That's\
    \ probably on the one end of the spectrum. You need to know everything \u2013\
    \ every single thing."
  sec: 1343
  time: '22:23'
  who: Danny
- line: On the other end of the spectrum, people want to accept orders. They don't
    take the initiative to push themselves more. It's not a bad thing. They just prioritize
    different things for their career, or in life in general. My parents are like
    that. They're just not very curious about many things. They do their nine-to-five,
    and then they spend time with their family. I think it's very honorable.
  who: Danny
- line: "Everyone lies on the spectrum of curiosity. The thing about curiosity is\
    \ that you can literally just tell yourself, \u201CI want to be more curious.\
    \ I want to know this more.\u201D For anyone who wants to improve their curiosity\
    \ and keep learning more different things, you just have to make the decision\
    \ that you want to learn more things. It's as simple as that. I feel that there's\
    \ no need to define curiosity. It's different for everyone. But everyone can do\
    \ their own version of curiosity."
  who: Danny
- line: "I'm working with Python code. This is the other end of the spectrum you mentioned.\
    \ I execute a line of code. It works. But I start wondering, \u201CWhy does it\
    \ work?\u201D I start digging deep, \u201CIn Scikit-Learn, we do this \u2018.fit()\u2019\
    . What does \u2018.fit()\u2019 do?\u201D Then I go, \u201CI have no idea what\
    \ this code does. Let me learn how logistic regression works\u201D. Then I learn\
    \ that, I come back and say \u201CHow does what I just learned translate to code?\u201D\
    \ And try to unwrap this thing. Did I understand correctly?"
  sec: 1449
  time: '24:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That would be on the higher end of curiosity. That was how I did it. The\
    \ first time I was starting to use the machine learning packages, I read the underlying\
    \ papers within the documentation. But I'm different to many people as well. Many\
    \ of my mentors did the same thing and that's what they told me to do. For anyone\
    \ out there \u2014 if you need to learn machine learning theory, there's no better\
    \ place than the papers which are implemented by Scikit-Learn. Or Light GBM or\
    \ XGBoost \u2014 the papers are all there as part of the documentation. It's an\
    \ amazing resource. You can learn a lot by reading through the math and trying\
    \ to figure out what's going on."

- line: "Let's talk about the B type \u2013 Builder. What do they do?"
  sec: 1536
  time: '25:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: "They're essentially software engineers, focused in the realm of data science\
    \ applications. You do stuff in the cloud, set up the infrastructure, manage workflows,\
    \ work with the data engineering team to make sure all the pipelines are solid,\
    \ force other members of your team to write clean code, unit tests, functional\
    \ tests and different things to make sure that the code will run in production.\
    \ All of these things are hallmark traits of a Type B data scientist. They're\
    \ software engineers. You can also think of them as the \u201Cnew age machine\
    \ learning engineers\u201D. They build those systems and the machine learning\
    \ ops, automated machine learning programs and different things like that."
  sec: 1553
  time: '25:53'
  who: Danny
- line: "One of the key differences between the Building type and the Analyst type\
    \ is that the Building type always wants to work in the production environment.\
    \ There's almost a different mindset. The type A data scientist will be very happy\
    \ to play around in Jupyter Notebooks: take data from a CSV file, explore and\
    \ see what's there, try to apply some machine learning to it straight away \u2014\
    \ after figuring out what the problem is, of course."
  who: Danny
- line: But the Type B data scientist doesn't want to do that. They think of all of
    that stuff as a waste of time. They're going to refactor it, to change it somehow.  People
    always talk about it as technical debt. There's a famous Google paper of the technical
    debt of machine learning systems. That's a really good paper written for type
    B data scientists. It's a very good thing to be aware of, even as you're starting
    in the field. You can make really bad decisions upfront, which will cost you a
    lot of money. If you haven't experienced that before, you will not know how much
    money it might potentially cost you or your company in the future.
  who: Danny
- line: You mentioned technical debt. I create technical debt, and type B fixes it.
  sec: 1695
  time: '28:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Almost. The perfect middle ground is where you have a Type B data scientist\
    \ doing the exploration. They can put in all the rigor and the infrastructure\
    \ from day one. Then you start exploring and testing models in production. In\
    \ my journey, I managed to get from the crazy type A data scientist, who had no\
    \ idea what they were doing, to working in a production environment with software\
    \ and data engineers. I was forced to see how they work. That's why sometimes\
    \ I refer to myself as a \u201Crecovering data scientist\u201D. Once you get exposure\
    \ to the way things should be done in a very formal software engineering type\
    \ of space, you can't unsee it \u2014 just like the video for my promotion of\
    \ this talk. These things are essentially threshold concepts. Someone teaches\
    \ you something that\u2019s hard to forget about the way that you view the world."

    \ a focus on exploring. They would work hand-in-hand with a Type B. The Type B\
    \ will be setting up the infrastructure for them, telling them \u201CIf you're\

  who: Danny
- line: The ideal team. I would say if you have two really strong type A and type
    B data scientists, you should be sweet. Ideally, you'd have more people learning
    from them as well. If they were your senior people, you'd have maybe one or two
    people underneath them, to shadow them and learn. But that should be almost enough
    for the leanest team that you'd want to try and solve a lot of problems.
  who: Danny
- line: "Maybe have one more person \u2014 let's call them type A as well \u2014 who\u2019\
    s doing a data analytics function. Once the data scientists have been building\
    \ their models and exploring their models, and using Docker to do all these things\
    \ at scale, then the results would pop out. They would be analyzing the results\
    \ with another data scientist who's very focused on doing the measurement piece.\
    \ Measurement is always left out when we deliver projects. We need to measure\
    \ the value of what we're doing. How much time are we saving? Are we solving the\
    \ problem properly? What was the previous rate that the problem was being solved?\
    \ How much uplift are we getting? What is the cost to my business, my profit?\
    \ Based on business metrics, and translating all of the work that the data science\
    \ team is doing into time savings and cost savings."

    actually solving problems.
  sec: 3688
  time: '1:01:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: The Type C data scientists would be perfect in that role as well. Maybe a
    lot of that measurement goes back to the actual tech lead, who's leading these
    data science teams. Because they should be able to translate what their team is
    doing into dollars, because I think that's really important when we're thinking
    about enterprise data science.

- line: We have quite a few questions. I think now is a good time to go through these
    questions and answer them. How can anyone without any domain expertise make a
    career in data science?
  sec: 3716
  time: '1:01:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: "There are consultants. Their whole career is being very good with the technical\
    \ part but not having to dive deep into the domain expertise. You could be a very\
    \ successful data scientist working in a consulting company. You're moving from\
    \ one domain to another. You don't necessarily need to be very strong in a single\
    \ domain. But you have to have skills where you can skill up quickly, in any domain.\
    \ That in itself is a very specialized skill. When we think of the big three \u2014\
    \ McKinsey, Bain, BCG-type consultants \u2014 that's what they're doing. They\
    \ get sent one day to an oil field, the next day, they're going to a farm to do\
    \ agriculture. It's very, very broad. They've started doing data science within\
    \ those spaces as well."
  sec: 3733
  time: '1:02:13'
  who: Danny

    \ one domain. You have to demonstrate that you can learn something quickly. That's\
    \ probably the best way to do it \u2014 to demonstrate your knowledge in one space."
  who: Danny

  sec: 3802
  time: '1:03:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say the domain expertise is more around the business domain. You can
    also have specializations, as opposed to the domain expertise. Let's say, Alexey
    is good at cloud computing and deep learning. Deep learning on the cloud is maybe
    his specialization. That would also count as a specialization where you don't
    need a lot of domain expertise in any specific business domain, as long as you
    can translate the different problems into your technical specification.

    as a fresher? Where and how to apply?
  sec: 3851
  time: '1:04:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Let\u2019s tackle the applying one \u2014 it\u2019s easier. There are two\
    \ schools of thought. You either apply for everywhere, or you apply for nowhere.\
    \ If you apply for everywhere, you're going through the public channels. You're\
    \ going through LinkedIn, the company website, through recruiters. The flip side\
    \ of that is you don't apply anywhere. You just only go through referral. It's\
    \ difficult both ways for people who are breaking into the industry. There's so\
    \ much competition and the area is just so hot. Those are the two different ways\
    \ that you can apply for these roles."
  sec: 3864
  time: '1:04:24'
  who: Danny
- line: "But no one really talks about how you get to the stage where you can start\
    \ applying or even getting referrals. The most important thing for anyone trying\
    \ to break into data science is a project portfolio. There's no other way, not\
    \ in this competitive environment. If you're lucky enough, and your company happens\
    \ to have an opening for a data scientist, and you're in an adjacent team, they\
    \ can give you a chance to jump into that data science team. Like I did. You could\
    \ be lucky. But it\u2019s very, very rare."
  who: Danny
- line: "Most of the time, for data science roles, they want people with experience.\
    \ The way to combat your lack of experience is to demonstrate what you can do.\
    \ One of the ways to do it in a quantifiable way is to have a project that's public.\
    \ You can share it with the recruiters, with people who might be in the hiring\
    \ management team. Or if you know someone in the company who knows other people.\
    \ This is where your network comes in. But if you don't have a portfolio to show\
    \ someone, it doesn't matter who you know. They can't vouch for you. I would definitely\
    \ say \u2014 project portfolio with as best programming standards as possible.\
    \ Try to avoid a lot of the common pitfalls that we see a lot in beginner projects."
  who: Danny
- line: "I can imagine what you're talking about \u2014 a Jupyter Notebook without\
    \ comments. You need to execute cells in some particular order. Things are dumped\
    \ there without any comments or without README, the requirements.txt file and\
    \ things like that. Right?"

- line: A follow up question from me personally. If somebody wants to break into data
    science, but they don't know, should they go with Type A or should they go with
    Type B? Do you think it's easier to go into a type A data science job than type
    B? Can we even compare them? Can we say that it's easier? Or these are just two
    separate things?
  sec: 4042
  time: '1:07:22'
  who: Alexey

    \ for, when you're looking for the first job? As bad as it sounds, if you had\
    \ skills in both, you can apply for both. But not many people have the time investment\
    \ to learn all of the different skills for type A and type B without work experience.\
    \ I'd recommend relying on your background. If you have a software engineering\
    \ background, it\u2019s easier to make it through as a type B."
  sec: 4068
  time: '1:07:48'
  who: Danny
- line: But there's also an alternative side to that as well. Let's say you're a software
    engineer. You did computer science as your undergrad. If you decide to go after
    an analyst role, you'll be more competitive because you're a strong programmer,
    compared to people who are not as strong programmers.  That's another perspective
    to think about.
  who: Danny
- line: "I wouldn\u2019t say there's a black and white \u2014 you should do this,\
    \ or you should do that. Try and think strategically of how you can use your skills\
    \ to best compete. Unfortunately, the environment is so competitive. Everyone\
    \ is looking for jobs here. If you're an analyst type and you're hearing this,\
    \ you're like, \u201CDamn, I'm not very good at programming. How can I skill up\
    \ in programming so I can compete against these other people?\u201D."
  who: Danny
- line: "There\u2019s a catch. To be able to have a very strong programming background\
    \ and develop it quickly \u2014 usually those things don't go hand in hand. It\
    \ takes a lot of time to become a good developer. You can pick up strong fundamentals\
    \ and start with good practices. It always helps. But time on the keyboard is\
    \ time on the keyboard. Someone with two or three years more technical experience\
    \ will always have stronger skills, compared to someone without any. Play with\
    \ the cards that you're dealt, essentially."
  who: Danny
- line: "You shouldn't feel discouraged about that. When we think of the analytics\
    \ teams, a lot of people want to go straight into a type A data science role.\
    \ These type A data science roles are actually more challenging than the Type\
    \ B ones. You're expected to deliver value sooner. If you're the first data scientist\
    \ within a company, you're not going to be a type B data scientist. They won't\
    \ know what they're doing. You'll be tasked with, \u201CFigure out why our sales\
    \ are down. You've got three weeks.\u201D"
  who: Danny
- line: Usually, the best type A data scientists are more senior. They would have
    had a few more years of experience working with data. Their intuition around the
    data and the business is usually higher. For people when they're starting off,
    if you come from an analytics background, not a software engineering background,
    a data analyst role is not a bad option. You can skill up in a lot of the things,
    which we traditionally think of as data science skills.
  who: Danny
- line: "You don't need to learn them on the job. You can learn them on Kaggle, through\
    \ online courses, through different things like that. The most important thing\
    \ when you\u2019re starting off your career is being close to the data. The more\
    \ you can use data \u2014 the better. SQL, Tableau, Excel \u2013 doesn't really\
    \ matter. A lot of people really feel stressed about that. \u201CIf I don't get\
    \ a data scientist role, I don't know what I'm going to do\u201D. We shouldn't\
    \ think like that. I thought like that when I started my career, I'd probably\
    \ still be waiting for my first role. A lot of people are thinking the same thing\
    \ too."
  who: Danny

    type A or type B data science from a bootcamp?
  sec: 4346
  time: '1:12:26'
  who: Alexey

    training material out there. You've got the guys at Super Data Science who are
    doing amazing stuff. They're trying to build out certifications which people can
    use to validate their skills and use it to get jobs. That's really awesome.
  sec: 4356

    \ marketing, they'll tell you about star people who landed jobs in Facebook, Google,\
    \ Amazon, after they took a six week bootcamp with no coding experience before.\
    \ Those things actually happen, but they are rare. They're probably outliers.\
    \ It's very difficult to teach all this stuff in six weeks. You can't really time\
    \ box learning data science. It should be a long, long journey. I've been learning\
    \ data science for who knows how long, five-six years. I still don't know what\

    to focus for that 12 weeks, and work your ass off. They're really, really valuable.
    They're good incentive devices to actually do that. When you do it, do a lot of
    research. Reach out to people who have taken those bootcamps to get their feedback.
    Find out how they were doing. If they have alumni that you can reach out to and
    learn a bit more. Definitely do as much research as you can. Don't dive into something
    in the spur of the moment and end up paying too much for something that you might
    regret.

    in SQL. My vision for the online course business was actually really interesting.
    When I started doing all of these things, I actually didn't want to sell a course
    at all. I felt that there were ethical issues with charging people money for something
    which they can learn for free. Would people even pay for something that I'm creating?

    \ a mentor. These mentors might have been an expert in certain areas, but they\
    \ also had things that they didn't know themselves as well. It was a learning\
    \ journey between the both of us when we're working together."

    I would recommend SQL first. It's a natural way to learn how to use data. From
    there, start learning one of the popular programming languages for data science.
    This could be R or Python. The vision for my next course is to teach data visualization,
    a bit of statistics, forecasting and data manipulation. But in both languages
    at the same time. It's very useful to use both. The learning experience will be
    very positive. It will be very challenging, but we'll make it happen. The more
    you know, the more opportunities will open up to you soon. It's very good to know

    \ And a little bit of forecasting \u2013 just enough to know what you need to\

    how we do the measurement, and how we optimize hyper parameters, it''s easier
    when we think of it in the traditional machine learning sense. With some of these
    algorithms, my plan is to get people to implement it using base Python, or using
    NumPy. I also wanted to cover Julia. I was hoping the machine learning thing will
