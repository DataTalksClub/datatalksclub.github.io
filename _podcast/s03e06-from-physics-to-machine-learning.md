- line: "This week we will talk about switching careers from physics to doing machine\
    \ learning. We have special guests today \u2014 Tatiana. Tatiana is a computer\
    \ vision deep learning engineer. She is a Kaggle competition master and she currently\
    \ works as a senior machine learning engineer at Cork University Hospital. Welcome\
    \ Tatiana."

  who: Tatiana
- header: "Tatiana\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go into our main topic of switching careers from physics, let us
    start with your background. Can you tell us a bit about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 140
  time: '2:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I started my career with a PhD in physics. Then I worked in science and different\
    \ institutes, universities developing different optical systems and lasers. Then\
    \ I started to have children. I had two maternity leaves in a row. During maternity\
    \ leave, I decided that it\u2019s nice to stay active. Nano photonic is not an\
    \ option because you need a lab for that. A lot of my friends got interested in\
    \ machine learning and they started talking about that. I decided to check courses\
    \ on artificial intelligence and machine learning and I liked that. I started\
    \ with courses, doing them one by one. Eventually, on maternity leave, I realized\
    \ it\u2019s what I want to do. It resulted in a career change at the end."
  sec: 152
  time: '2:32'
  who: Tatiana
- line: "I also got a small internship that brought me to that job in the hospital.\
    \ I developed necessary links. In that internship, I was doing some machine learning\
    \ projects for analyzing signals for medical needs. In the hospital, they had\
    \ a similar project. My name eventually came up and that\u2019s how I got in a\
    \ position. Now I am developing a decision support tool to help doctors to identify\
    \ anomalies during the labor process and act promptly when a C-section is necessary\
    \ to prevent some bad severe outcome during labor for the fetus."
  who: Tatiana
- header: 12 career hacks and changing career
- line: You mentioned quite a few interesting things in your story. I think we will
    cover some of them later, like how you approached your learning. A few months
    ago, I was checking my Twitter and I saw your thread there. After reading this
    thread, I decided to contact you. It got my attention, it was really interesting.
    The threat was about 12 career hacks. Can you tell us about this threat? So what
    are these career hacks?
  sec: 260
  time: '4:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: "On Twitter I was talking about career change. It\u2019s a popular topic.\
    \ Everybody changes career, at least a couple of times in their lifetime. The\
    \ first time is always tricky. People worry about career changes. They ask questions\
    \ on \u201Chow to do it?\u201D and \u201Chow to approach that challenge?\u201D\
    \ I learned a few useful hacks during my career change. I learned it the hard\
    \ way. I decided I should share my experience, so people can speed up the process\
    \ a bit, using my advice, if they find it useful."
  sec: 305
  time: '5:05'
  who: Tatiana
- header: 'Hack #1: Change your social circle'
- line: "The first career hack \u2014 one of the most important ones \u2014 is to\
    \ change your social circle. Be careful about your social circle. If you have\
    \ friends from childhood and parents, you don\u2019t change them. But you have\
    \ a lot of colleagues and you have a lot of shallow acquaintances. If they are\
    \ not making a difference in your network, if they are not helping you in your\
    \ career change, if they keep telling you that \u201CYou are going to fail\u201D\
    , \u201CIt\u2019s a bad idea, you have a good job, why are you changing your career?\u201D\
    , \u201CChanging career and maternity leave that does not work, nobody does it\u201D\
    . In this case this circle does not help you. It\u2019s important to cut off such\
    \ social interactions. Then you will have a space for new people to come into\
    \ your life \u2014 you will have more free time. Then you can have people that\
    \ are more supportive, that already changed their career and that can help you\
    \ and guide you through that."
  sec: 347
  time: '5:47'
  who: Tatiana
- line: "That is essentially what I did. I cut off about 70 percent of my communications\
    \ with ex-colleagues and all those pessimistic people who are telling me that\
    \ I will fail, changing careers is a bad idea. When I stopped communicating with\
    \ them, I started to look for options. That\u2019s how I found the ODS community.\
    \ I entered the community and that is where I found my new network in a career.\
    \ Not only in my career now, I also have friends there. They were very supportive."
  who: Tatiana
- line: "There is a saying that you are the average of three to nine people, people\
    \ who you are friends with. So, it\u2019s important to be careful in choosing\
    \ your friends and choosing your circles. That is what the DataTalks.club community\
    \ is also abou \u2014 to create that kind of circle, that kind of social interaction\
    \ that helps you grow."
  who: Tatiana
- header: 'Hack #2: Forget your fears and stereotypes'
- line: "The second hack is to forget about your fears and stereotypes. A lot of people\
    \ are quite afraid of change. They have a lot of stereotypes, \u201CChanging career\
    \ at 35, oh you are too old\u201D, \u201CChanging career on maternity leave, that\
    \ is not going to work\u201D and so on. Those are not real. Those are just your\
    \ fantasies. They have nothing to do with reality."
  sec: 470
  time: '7:50'
  who: Tatiana
- line: "Some people contact me and ask me questions like \u201CI am 26. Am I too\
    \ old to change my career?\u201D And I am like \u201CSeriously? You are 26. You\
    \ are not too old!\u201D And you are not old at 36, 46, 56. You are going to change\
    \ your career. At 60, there is no chance you are going to do the same stuff that\
    \ you are doing today. That means that between today and between your 60s, there\
    \ will be quite a lot of changes anyway. Just get used to that thought."
  who: Tatiana
- header: 'Hack #3: Forget distractions'
- line: "Career hack #3. Forget about distractions that do not bring value in your\
    \ life. In my case I realized that such distractions were Instagram, Facebook,\
    \ watching movies. Even Twitter and LinkedIn \u2014 those nets are important for\
    \ PR \u2014 but when you are changing careers, you have nothing to PR yet. You\
    \ did not yet make that pet project. You are just learning. So, shut down all\
    \ the social networks. You will see how much time you have. You need to create\
    \ time. When you are on maternity leave, you do not have time. You only work when\
    \ you have a chance. If you are going to spend time on Instagram and Facebook,\
    \ it\u2019s just not practical."
  sec: 533
  time: '8:53'
  who: Tatiana
- line: "You need to cut off all those distractions. Some useful things like LinkedIn,\
    \ you are going to use them later when you are ready. But don\u2019t open that\
    \ when you are changing your career and you are learning. Because you open it\
    \ for a minute and then you absorb for 15 minutes. That\u2019s what usually happens."
  who: Tatiana
- line: I think there are some apps that help you do this. You can have an extension
    for chrome that blocks Facebook, Instagram. You can also install it on your phone.
    Did you use something like this?
  sec: 595
  time: '9:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I have a good internal will. If it helps, if you need, use an external
    thing to block you from that.
  sec: 610
  time: '10:10'
  who: Tatiana
- line: That is what I need usually.
  sec: 622
  time: '10:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. When I was stopping smoking, I got off smoking. And that was it. I\
    \ used to smoke quite a lot, like a pack of cigarettes. But I just cut it as soon\
    \ as I got pregnant. That is it. Same here. I just cut it and did not open it.\
    \ Now I open it again, but that is because I need that now for career options\
    \ \u2014 to network and so on. But not all... For Instagram \u2014 that\u2019\
    s it."
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Tatiana
- header: "Hack #4: Don\u2019t overestimate others and don\u2019t underestimate yourself"
- line: "When you are changing a career you have this impostor syndrome. Suddenly,\
    \ everybody is so smart. They know everything. But you don\u2019t know anything.\
    \ You keep learning and learning and learning. But you still have this impostor\
    \ syndrome \u2014  because it is hard to validate yourself. So, the hack is don't\
    \ overestimate others and don\u2019t underestimate yourself."
  sec: 649
  time: '10:49'
  who: Tatiana
- line: But how are you going to estimate your skills correctly, if you change in
    career? You need external validation. For external validation, I started to go
    to interviews. Interviews show you which skills you lack, which skills you are
    good at. It helps you to put your place as a specialist with this skill set on
    the market.
  who: Tatiana
- line: "Go to the interviews even if you are not ready to start the job. My mistake\
    \ was when I was on maternity leave, I was waiting for Alisa to grow up a bit,\
    \ so I can start going for interviews. That was wrong. I could have done it earlier\
    \ \u2014 just for external validation \u2014 to see which skills I need to increase\
    \ and which skills are actually okay \u2014 to get rid of that impostor syndrome."
  who: Tatiana
- line: "But the best thing to fight the imposter syndrome is not to go and interview\
    \ yourself, but to conduct interviews. Be on the other side of the table. There\
    \ are mock interviews. A mock interview is not a real interview. There are platforms\
    \ for that like pramp \u2014 you interview others who are trying to go to the\
    \ big tech companies. When you are on the other side, when you are an interviewer,\
    \ you are going to immediately see all the weak sports for yourself. That helps\
    \ you: now you can adjust your own behavior that fits better and helps you to\
    \ pass the interview again."
  who: Tatiana
- line: How does it help? When you interview others, how does it help to find weak
    spots in yourself?
  sec: 768
  time: '12:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: "When you interview others, and the other person keeps talking on and on about\
    \ his experience, you realize \u201COh my god, I am doing exactly that. I need\
    \ to shut up. I am talking too much\u201D. When I saw it in others, I was like\
    \ \u201CThat\u2019s not good\u201D. I realized I need to write a concise story\
    \ in two sentences, maximum three and practice it. Because if I am going like\
    \ this guy, that is not good."
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Tatiana
- line: "Or you ask a person to code, and the person immediately starts coding without\
    \ thinking how to solve the problem. You are like \u201CYeah, I am doing exactly\
    \ that. I shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201D First you need to think and then to write\
    \ a code. It\u2019s much better."
  who: Tatiana
- line: "It\u2019s hard to spot it in yourself. It\u2019s easier when you do mock\
    \ interviews with others. We will come back to that when we discuss interview\
    \ preparation. But yeah, that really helps me because it also was a change in\
    \ psychology."
  who: Tatiana
- line: "I was working in science. Academics have a bit of a different mindset. When\
    \ you come to industry, the mindset is a bit changed. It\u2019s important to have\
    \ those mock interviews from people with industry. They are not about your potential\
    \ and how smart you are, it\u2019s about which projects you have done. Projects\
    \ that are similar to the project that they need to do. Tailoring an interview\
    \ helps."
  who: Tatiana
- line: "It also helps when you see that others struggle as well. Your imposter syndrome\
    \ will disappear when you start to interview others. All your impressions that\
    \ everybody is ingenious but not you \u2014 that will disappear. You will see\
    \ \u201CAha! He is also having problems with that. It\u2019s okay that I have\
    \ it.\u201D"
  who: Tatiana
- header: 'Hack #5: Attention genius'
- line: "I call the next hack \u201Cattention genius\u201D. You don\u2019t notice\
    \ everything in your life. You are not capable of noticing everything. You only\
    \ notice things that you pay attention to. And you can choose what to pay attention\
    \ to. You can focus on positive things. Or you can focus on negative things. You\
    \ did not solve the problem today \u2014 you can focus on that. Or you solved\
    \ that problem \u2014 you can focus on that. Some people will say \u201CYou will\
    \ not succeed\u201D, \u201CYou will fail\u201D. You are going to have haters.\
    \ It\u2019s important to cut off attention from those people. Whatever is going\
    \ to put you down, just cut off attention from that. You got a hater. Great. Do\
    \ not pay attention to him. Pay attention to those who help you, to your mentor,\
    \ to more important things that bring value to your life. It\u2019s good advice\
    \ in general. Choose where to focus your attention."
  sec: 892
  time: '14:52'
  who: Tatiana
- header: 'Hack #6: Make a team'
- line: "The next one is make a team. It\u2019s harder to progress just by yourself\
    \ or to learn by yourself. It\u2019s more beneficial and faster to learn and to\
    \ grow when you have a team of like-minded people. You can create a team for nearly\
    \ everything. You can create a team to play kaggle. You can create a team to write\
    \ a paper, to do the pet project, even to do the course. You can do some courses\
    \ in a team together. Recently, I had a course about venture capitals in a team\
    \ of five. That was fun. We could discuss things together. It\u2019s more fun\
    \ to learn that way. What\u2019s most important \u2014 other people have different\
    \ expertise, and you can absorb that expertise from them. When you are kaggling\
    \ with great guys, who know a lot about other stuff, you learn from them much\
    \ faster."
  sec: 956
  time: '15:56'
  who: Tatiana
- line: "The hack is not \u201Cwaiting for the team to come\u201D. It\u2019s really\
    \ \u201Cmake a team\u201D. You want to make a team. You are going to find the\
    \ people, convince them to play with you on Kaggle or to do pet projects, do that\
    \ paper. You need to find win-win strategies. You need to find people who will\
    \ also benefit from that, who want the same course or who need that paper. When\
    \ you are doing that together, you learn from them, you help them. It\u2019s a\
    \ win-win strategy. It\u2019s good because it saves your time as well. It gives\
    \ you a result \u2014 you have a paper or you have Kaggle master, but in a shorter\
    \ time. It\u2019s also critical in maternity leave."
  who: Tatiana
- line: How do you find these people? How do you go about convincing them?
  sec: 1049
  time: '17:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Sometimes people find me, quite a lot of times they contact me and\u2026"
  sec: 1057
  time: '17:37'
  who: Tatiana
- line: "Now. Because now people know you. But let\u2019s say some time ago."
  sec: 1062
  time: '17:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "When I just started, I was finding people on Kaggle chat and writing to them.\
    \ One guy was from Australia. He seemed nice in chat and he was nervous in Kaggle.\
    \ I could see that he programs better than me. That\u2019s what I needed. But\
    \ he doesn\u2019t have a clue how to solve the problem. I had a clue because I\
    \ have read the papers. So, I just wrote to him that I have a PhD in physics \u2014\
    \ the competition was about astronomy \u2014 maybe we can benefit from each other?\
    \ He replied \u201Cyes\u201D. He was in Australia, I was in Ireland and then we\
    \ started to do that together and we got to the top. Then I invited one guy from\
    \ Moscow, who is a software engineer with great experience. He was Kaggling for\
    \ a while, and that is how we got first silver, almost gold. It was good."
  sec: 1066
  time: '17:46'
  who: Tatiana
- line: "So the hack here is \u201Cjust to reach out to people\u201D."
  sec: 1117
  time: '18:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Reach out to people, exactly. The same with papers. I wanted to write a paper\
    \ but I did not have material. So, I reached out to a guy from ODS who won a competition.\
    \ I asked him \u201CCan I please use your code and write a paper based on that?\u201D\
    \ I wrote to him and he gave me access to everything, even his server for calculations.\
    \ He helped me with advice as well."
  sec: 1123
  time: '18:43'
  who: Tatiana
- line: "Then I was looking for somebody else to help me with writing because I was\
    \ short on time. I just wrote \u201CI am looking for a co-author who will help\
    \ me to craft a paper\u201D. That is how Alexander Kalinin wrote to me. He is\
    \ great at writing papers. He helped me to craft that, to finish that thing. And\
    \ it got accepted to the CVPR workshops. That is how you make it. You find win-win\
    \ strategists. You find people who\u2019re also interested in that."
  who: Tatiana
- line: "Reach out to people, have something to offer. Have a clear offer in the first\
    \ message. Let\u2019s imagine a situation when I won a Kaggle competition. That\
    \ never happened but I like imagining this sometimes. If somebody wrote to me\
    \ saying \u201CAwesome solution. Can I write a paper about this?\u201D It\u2019\
    s very difficult to say \u201Cno\u201D, right?"
  sec: 1179
  time: '19:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I also thought this way and it worked out. Also if you don\u2019t know\
    \ whom to contact, like in kaggle, you see the person, so you can write the person.\
    \ Or you can also do that in DataTalks.Club. You also can write an open message,\
    \ like on LinkedIn, \u201CHello, I am working on that paper, I am looking for\
    \ co-authors. I need help with this and that. I do calculations, I have all the\
    \ code set up, but I need somebody for running experiments. I\u2019m looking for\
    \ a student who can volunteer for that and have a paper.\u201D I can assure you,\
    \ within 24 hours, you are going to have a lot of students from all places in\
    \ the world. They will be happy to help you with doing those tasks for being a\
    \ co-author."

  time: '20:05'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Yeah. Thanks! So we are done with six hacks? There are six more.

- line: "Hack #7 is less is more, forget about perfectionism. There\u2019s the Pareto\
    \ rule that says that 20% of the effort gives you 80% of the result. That\u2019\

    \ are those minor things that you need to finish, they can take an enormous amount\
    \ of time. Maybe you are not good at that. Maybe you don\u2019t know anything\
    \ about that. Well, outsource it. Delegate it. Find that win-win strategy, and\
    \ get a team. The best is to focus your energy on those 20% that bring 80% of\

    \ creation always happens in the head. The artist visualizes the painting, he\
    \ can create it in his mind. And then he paints what he created. The same initial\
    \ creation applies to everything. You want to do some code for a Kaggle competition\
    \ or for your pet project or your paper \u2014  when you have some free time.\
    \ But you are busy with a kid, you cannot work right now. But your mind is free."

  who: Tatiana
- line: You are not working on the computer, but you can save lots of time if you
    are thinking about what you are going to write or what you are going to code.
    For instance, you are cooking dinner and you are thinking how you will approach
    the architecture for that machine learning solution, or what you are going to
    write in that paper, or what you are going to write in the proposal and so on.
  who: Tatiana
- line: You create it in your head during the day when you are busy with other stuff.
    You have a lot of time when you create it in your head. You just cannot get your
    hands on the computer. Then, during the evening, when you finally have a few hours
    to put your hands on the computer, you have already created everything in your
    head. This is going to speed up you. You need to do it and you already know what
    to do.

    In some, you focus just on breathing, in some you focus on your body sensations.
    There are analytical meditations when you just about some problem and focus your
    attention on that problem. I think analytical meditation is very useful for learning
    how to think about some technical problems without distraction. I had this skill
    from school. We used to have school Olympiads in physics and math. You have four
    hours and very challenging problems. You sit there for four hours, trying to get
    that medal in the school Olympics. That really helps you to focus straight for
    four hours on those physics problems.

    you could do it from home. You do not need anything. One of the resources that
    I did not mention, you can get some access to free GPUs, using credits in Amazon
