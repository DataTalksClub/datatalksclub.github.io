transcript:
- header: "Mikio\u2019s background"
- line: "This week, we'll talk about freelancing and consulting. And we have a special\
    \ guest today \u2014 Mikio. Actually, Mikio was my teacher six years ago. I was\
    \ studying at TU Berlin for my master\u2019s and Mikio was one of the teachers\
    \ of the machine learning class. I was very lucky, because, after that year, he\
    \ left academia and joined the industry. So I was able to witness his teaching.\
    \ After working at TU Berlin, Mikio joined Zalando. He worked there in many different\
    \ roles. He spent quite a few years there. Right?"
  sec: 119
  time: '1:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Four and a half years.
  sec: 174
  time: '2:54'
  who: Mikio
- line: And then he joined GetYourGuide. He worked for some time there. And right
    now, Mikio is working as a consultant. He consults companies on how to make the
    best use of machine learning, looking on the whole picture from technical infrastructure
    to product development. Welcome, Mikio!
  sec: 176
  time: '2:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hello! Thanks for inviting me and for the kind words about my teaching.
  sec: 194
  time: '3:14'
  who: Mikio
- line: "It was really great. I remember it was the sixth or seventh lecture of machine\
    \ learning. Professor M\xFCller was on a business trip and you were a replacement.\
    \ You came into the class, you looked at a topic, and said, \"Linear regression\
    \ on the sixth lesson? Seriously?\""
  sec: 201
  time: '3:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yea, I remember that. We also did a practical course on big data.
  sec: 220
  time: '3:40'
  who: Mikio
- line: Yeah, that was the second semester, the winter semester. That was fun. I did
    talk a bit about your career already, but maybe before we start with our main
    topic, you can also tell us about your career journey so far.
  sec: 228
  time: '3:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Originally I wanted to become a professor. I was a researcher. But then the
    only goal you have is to become a professor. I was writing papers, supervising
    PhD students, doing conferences. I went to NeurIPS five or six times. Originally
    I studied computer science. I always wanted to build something and at some point,
    writing these papers became less and less fulfilling. It's also really hard. For
    these conferences, the acceptance rate is less than 20%. So you do a lot of work
    that is never published.
  sec: 250
  time: '4:10'
  who: Mikio
- line: So this bump boost [an algorithm that Mikio invented], was it ever accepted?
  sec: 295
  time: '4:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't think so.
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Mikio
- line: How many times did you try to submit it?
  sec: 300
  time: '5:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Like two or three times. It was a nice algorithm. At least, there's one guy
    who wrote his master thesis trying to parallelize it on a GPU. So at least it
    was good for something. Then I had this streamdrill / twimpack project, a mini-startup
    on the side, which we did it for a few years. We did tech pilots with some companies.
    So it exposed me to this world. The funny thing is, if you're inside the university,
    everybody tells you "this is the best place to be". And then you start working
    with other people, and you think "this is also interesting". Then I went to Zalando,
    and there I really learned a lot. I continued trying different things. I started
    as an engineering manager. Then they had this principal role, so I thought, "I
    want to be more technical", and so on. I look for opportunities to learn something
    all the time.
  sec: 304
  time: '5:04'
  who: Mikio
- header: What Mikio helps with
- line: Eventually, you ended up being a sole consultant. What do you help with? What
    do you consult about?
  sec: 373
  time: '6:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I help companies to do machine learning in practice. I worked on so many\
    \ different aspects: I created algorithms as a researcher, I organized teams,\
    \ I worked on a machine learning platform team at Zalando as a consulting architect.\
    \ This principal role was a bit like internal consulting. I always start with\
    \ a technical problem, but then I wonder, \"what is the real problem?\", and then\
    \ you end up thinking about organization and things like that. So I help companies\
    \ become better at that \u2014 whatever it is. That was the original idea."
  sec: 383
  time: '6:23'
  who: Mikio
- line: So you're like a principal data science / machine learning person to hire?
  sec: 438
  time: '7:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. One decision I made early on is that I wouldn't be hands-on myself. I
    think it's a very different kind of work. If you're doing data analysis yourself
    then you'll have to put on a lot of hours. So I'm more on the mentoring side,
    so I can also do a couple of projects in parallel.
  sec: 444
  time: '7:24'
  who: Mikio
- header: Moving from a full-time job to freelancing
- line: How does it work out for you?
  sec: 473
  time: '7:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: So far, it's good. When I decided I wanted to try this, I quit my job at GetYourGuide.
    I thought that I first need to write a lot of blog posts for 2-3 months for promoting
    myself. I thought it would take some time. But actually, I immediately got my
    first project. And then another one. So I stopped working, then there was a weekend,
    and then I started a consulting gig. And there was no time between. It was a bit
    surprising.
  sec: 475
  time: '7:55'
  who: Mikio
- line: Did you at least write something on LinkedIn, and this is how you found a
    client?
  sec: 527
  time: '8:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not till January. I started in November. When I started, people I knew from
    Zalando times found out that I quit. They asked, "What are you doing now? Why
    don't you join our team?" I said, "No, I want to try consulting". And then a few
    of them said, "If you want to do consulting, we can try that". That's how I got
    my first gig. In retrospect, it's not that surprising. I knew a lot of people.
    If you're at a company like Zalando, you get to know a lot of people. And then
    they move on. So you have a good network already. And now everybody is looking
    for data scientists, they are very hard to find. So, it's not as hard as you think
    it is.
  sec: 534
  time: '8:54'
  who: Mikio
- header: Finding clients and importance of a strong network
- line: So it's not as hard as you think if you have a strong network.
  sec: 608
  time: '10:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I think it's the key. Also, you work with many people. If a project works
    well, then somebody recommends you. It's not like you build a great website, and
    then you sell it, and then people come. Consulting is a lot about trust. It's
    always better if somebody said that "I did a project with them, it was great".
    It's not uncommon that it works like this.
  sec: 612
  time: '10:12'
  who: Mikio
- line: "So this is how it happened to you. You found the first client through your\
    \ network of people who worked with you at Zalando. You found them \u2014 or they\
    \ found you. Then you worked for them, and they recommended you to others. Is\
    \ this how it started?"
  sec: 653
  time: '10:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. They didn't recommend me. But there were a few of these things and they
    became the first few projects. In January I posted on LinkedIn that I'm doing
    this now. This career change on LinkedIn always get a lot of engagement. There's
    this thing that says "I'm working at a new company". And everybody says, "Yeah,
    Great! All the best!" On LinkedIn, liking is like retweeting. It's shared quite
    widely.
  sec: 672
  time: '11:12'
  who: Mikio
- line: Also, if you update your profile, everyone in your network gets a notification.
  sec: 708
  time: '11:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That led to a few talks, but no new project at that time. But then I started\
    \ doing lots of talks. I gave a talk here, I did a couple of podcasts. Through\
    \ that, this summer, I got a large number \u2014 an okay number \u2014 of new\
    \ inquiries."
  sec: 715
  time: '11:55'
  who: Mikio
- line: By "okay" you mean more than you can handle?
  sec: 748
  time: '12:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Workload-wise, it was okay. But currently, I have to think about what
    kind of projects I want to do.
  sec: 751
  time: '12:31'
  who: Mikio
- line: So now you have projects to choose from?
  sec: 766
  time: '12:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. In freelancing, you actually have this freedom. You can say "I won't
    do this". And if something's not working, or you're struggling, you can think
    about it and try a different kind of project. This was also pretty constant. In
    the beginning, I was like, "this will take a few months until I have income again".
    Then suddenly, it's okay. But what if it stops? And then, at some point, you have
    too many projects.
  sec: 769
  time: '12:49'
  who: Mikio
- line: So, more things to worry about compared to a usual full-time job?
  sec: 814
  time: '13:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 820
  time: '13:40'
  who: Mikio
- line: How do you usually find clients? Or they find you?
  sec: 821
  time: '13:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, they find me, so far. As I said, I did a bit of marketing here. But
    then the question is, "what do you do then?" You have a first meeting to understand
    what they need.
  sec: 827
  time: '13:47'
  who: Mikio
- line: So to find clients, you need to have a good network. Then you need to give
    a couple of talks, so people outside of your immediate network know you exist.
    And that's enough to actually get started. And then the word of mouth helps to
    get new clients.
  sec: 856
  time: '14:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's actually easy to start up. If you have one or two projects, then you\u2019\
    re already making enough money. You don't have to bootstrap for two years and\
    \ not make any money. Transitioning was smoother than I thought. Then you see\
    \ how it goes. Also, if a client is good and everything works well, they can extend\
    \ the project."
  sec: 887
  time: '14:47'
  who: Mikio
- header: Building a network
- line: "I want to ask you a few things. Let's first start with the network thing.\
    \ You said starting wasn't too difficult for you because you had a good network.\
    \ By the way, there is a message from Felix M\xFCller, saying, \"Greetings from\
    \ one of those ex-Zalando colleagues\"."
  sec: 928
  time: '15:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: For people who want to start freelancing, how do they build such a network?
    If they want to start freelancing in a couple of years, how should they approach
    building a network?
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: First, you can start in the company where you are. It's quite natural to me.
  sec: 963
  time: '16:03'
  who: Mikio
- line: Hang out by the water cooler?
  sec: 980
  time: '16:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, hang out by the water cooler. I sometimes meet for coffee. Not just in
    the team, but maybe there's somebody from another project. You say, "maybe we
    can have lunch together" or coffee, just to get to know each other. Also, I always
    ask people whether they know somebody and then they introduce you to them. You
    can have this typical one-hour networking meeting. Let's talk a bit about that.
  sec: 981
  time: '16:21'
  who: Mikio
- line: You have to find people. You can ask people in your network whether they know
    somebody interesting. If you see an interesting post on LinkedIn or Twitter, you
    can connect with people and say, "This is interesting. Maybe you can have a meeting?".
    I'm also getting requests like this. There's also an app, which is called "lunch
    club". You register there and say what you're interested in. Then each week, you
    get matched with somebody. You can also go to meetups, and just talk to people.
  sec: 1024
  time: '17:04'
  who: Mikio
- line: First, you get the contact. Then you meet for one hour. And to me, it seems
    there's always a structure. Everybody does an intro about themselves, you tell
    a little bit about the history of what you're interested in. That takes like half
    an hour. Usually, in that time, if you see some common things, you go deeper into
    these topics. And then you're done. If you do this for a while, you get to know
    a lot of people. on.
  sec: 1088
  time: '18:08'
  who: Mikio
- line: So you said lunch club, LinkedIn, and meetups. I guess now it's a bit more
    difficult with meetups.
  sec: 1134
  time: '18:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's totally okay if you see a post on LinkedIn, just make a connection
    request. Then just say, "this looks interesting, if you want, let's meet". Just
    ask them. They can only say "no" or not get back to you. But people are quite
    a bit open to this. Maybe more open than you think.
  sec: 1142
  time: '19:02'
  who: Mikio
- header: Initial meetings with clients
- line: The other thing you said, "Now you get a client. The interesting part is what
    happens next". First, you have this intro call. You figure out if you can help
    the client. Right? How does it look like? Let's say you get a LinkedIn message
    saying, "Hey, Mikio, I've heard you're freelancing. Can you help us?". What happens
    after that?
  sec: 1149
  time: '19:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: A few things. Usually, there's one meeting and then sometimes they say "You
    also need to meet these people before we make the decision". Sometimes it's quite
    a few meetings for which you don't get any money.
  sec: 1192
  time: '19:52'
  who: Mikio
- line: You don't bill that?
  sec: 1209
  time: '20:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No. You try to build some trust, to see whether it actually makes sense.\
    \ If you get a client, and this would be a project that takes a few weeks or months\
    \ \u2014 usually for quite a lot of money. So this is the kind of unpaid marketing\
    \ that you have to do. When I started, I had these mentoring projects \u2014 working\
    \ for a few days, more like a few meetings here and there. Over time I realised\
    \ that all this other work is also work. You don't get money for it."
  sec: 1215
  time: '20:15'
  who: Mikio
- header: Understanding what clients need
- line: We also need to understand what they want. And it's also important to understand
    what their problem actually is.
  sec: 1297
  time: '21:37'
  who: Mikio
- line: What they want and what they need.
  sec: 1307
  time: '21:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. They are already looking for somebody who does this and that, but that's
    already the solution part. And then the question is, "Why do they want that?".
  sec: 1309
  time: '21:49'
  who: Mikio
- line: Like, "We need an expert in deep learning". But why? Then you start digging.
    And then turns out that maybe a logistic regression would solve their problem.
  sec: 1319
  time: '21:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Lecture number six, right? [laughs]
  sec: 1332
  time: '22:12'
  who: Mikio
- header: Template for the offer (Million dollar consulting)
- line: There's one book with a very funny title that somebody recommended. It's called
    "million dollar consulting" by Alan Weiss. That's a good book. I'm not sure whether
    you can take this and make one million dollars.
  sec: 1338
  time: '22:18'
  who: Mikio
- line: I was going to order that. Now I'm not sure.
  sec: 1357
  time: '22:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: He gives a template for the offer, which I found quite good. First, you take
    time to write down a summary of what you understood. What is the problem they
    want to solve? What are you offering? Then you can also talk about your fees.
    Every time I do this, it's actually quite insightful. It's also good for them
    to check whether you really have the same understanding. Sometimes they say "When
    can you start?" and it never gets really explicitly written down.
  sec: 1365
  time: '22:45'
  who: Mikio
- line: So the outcome of the initial meetings is to understand if you can help them
    and what they actually need. Then you write a summary and decide on your hourly
    rate. Then you send them this email, and then they either agree or not. Right?
  sec: 1400
  time: '23:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. You can also do it in a Google doc and have them comment on it, and discuss
    it a little bit.
  sec: 1420
  time: '23:40'
  who: Mikio
- header: 'Deciding on rate type: hourly, daily, per project'
- line: We already have a question here. How to decide on this rate? The question
    is about the daily rate. We had some prior chats about this, you also mentioned
    something about a trade-off between pay per day or per hour or per project. Maybe
    you can also talk about that a bit.
  sec: 1432
  time: '23:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: "First, I should say that I'm really bad at negotiating. If you're a future\
    \ client, you should know. The natural thing is to start with an hourly rate.\
    \ It's very transparent. You have Google Sheets where you put in all the hours.\
    \ Then, at the end of the month, you write an invoice. But as a downside, this\
    \ is a very strange incentive for you. It would be great if you get more money\
    \ if you help the client, and not if you just work more hours.  Sometimes it doesn't\
    \ make any sense. I also don't want to work more hours. And then you suddenly\
    \ realise you're actually not working as many hours as you thought you would.\
    \ For whatever reason \u2014 because it's easier, or the project is moving faster\
    \ than you thought, or people don't need that much help."
  sec: 1455
  time: '24:15'
  who: Mikio
- line: But if you go for the hourly rate, how do we can come up with this rate? In
    the "million dollar consulting" book, he proposes to talk about the value of the
    work you're doing. Then you say, "I go in, I do this logistic regression model,
    you save 100,000 euro. So let's say 10% of that" or "5% of that". This is a good
    argument, but sometimes it's hard to figure out the value of the project. Also,
    many people think in terms of salaries.
  sec: 1519
  time: '25:19'
  who: Mikio
- line: It's also risky. How do you know that your project will succeed? You're betting
    on the success of the project, but in machine learning, it's not always the case.
  sec: 1565
  time: '26:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's true. The book says you ask the client "How much money will this make?".
    They say, "Could be between 1-2 millions". Then you take the lower bound. So you
    say "You think it'll make at least 1 million?". I've tried. I know people who
    managed to do that. But I think it's a much tougher discussion. Also, if you do
    this, you can never talk about hourly rates. If you talk about hourly rates, they
    will always try to say "Okay, if this is 10,000, how many hours is this work?".
    And then you can't get away from it.
  sec: 1577
  time: '26:17'
  who: Mikio
- line: And then there's another weird thing. You ask for 10,000 euro over three months,
    so each month you get a third of it. Or you ask half first and then half again.
    But with this fixed-rate, some companies are suddenly afraid that this might look
    like employment. If you're paying somebody as a freelancer, but it's like employment,
    then as a company, you have to pay health insurance and stuff like that.
  sec: 1624
  time: '27:04'
  who: Mikio
- line: They are afraid that the finance authority will come and say, "looks like
    you're evading taxes".
  sec: 1671
  time: '27:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: You have this guy, you're paying him a monthly fee, which looks like salary.
    So now you have to pay all this health insurance. So this is the downside.
  sec: 1687
  time: '28:07'
  who: Mikio
- line: If somebody wants to start freelancing, but they have no idea what the market
    rate is and they don't know how much other freelancers make. Then it's difficult
    to come up with this hourly price. How to come up with it? Do you ask the client,
    "How much do you want to pay me?" When you're starting, it's difficult to come
    up with a number. Do you have any tips?
  sec: 1706
  time: '28:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: I asked other consultants when they make. I was lucky because my first client
    was somebody I worked with previously. At some point, he suggested that I increase
    my rate a little bit. If you're hands-on and working a lot of hours you make less
    per hour. It's linked to the impact you're making. But then you also have to see
    whether it feels right for you.
  sec: 1733
  time: '28:53'
  who: Mikio
- line: So you don't have a daily rate for your projects now. Or how do you do this
    now? Hourly rate, daily rate or project rate? Or it really depends?
  sec: 1777
  time: '29:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on the client. For older ones, I have an hourly rate. You can set
    your prices and if you can agree on something, it's good. The advantage of a fixed
    rate is that you can focus on doing the best work. Sometimes they're like, "He's
    so expensive, let's try to use him less". So you can just focus on work. And sometimes
    it's more work, sometimes it's less, but it's also less of a hassle. Also, if
    it's an hourly rate, usually clients ask for the weekly estimate. Because they
    need to do a budget for that. So actually the fix rate doesn't really hurt them,
    because then it's already budgeted, and they can just spend it.
  sec: 1791
  time: '29:51'
  who: Mikio
- line: But at the end, you have to ask yourself, "How many hours do I want to work?",
    "How much money do I want to make?", "When does it feel okay or not okay?".  Also,
    when you come out of a full-time job, you know what you would earn as a full-time
    employee.
  sec: 1802
  time: '30:02'
  who: Mikio
- line: This is how much you aim to make, at the very least.
  sec: 1889
  time: '31:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It should be more because you always have to pay more for your health insurance\
    \ \u2014 you have to cover all of it. And you have this risk that there is no\
    \ project."
  sec: 1894
  time: '31:34'
  who: Mikio
- line: So you need to think about the average, the expected value, right?
  sec: 1908
  time: '31:48'
  who: Alexey
- header: Taking vacations (and paying twice for them)
- line: Yeah. And your vacations, right? Nobody pays for that.
  sec: 1912
  time: '31:52'

    You need to factor this into your rate. You should go for "If I make this in 10
    months per year, then it should be enough money". Also if you have several clients,
    you might feel bad about not being there for them. But, on the other hand, most
    of the people work with their employees, and it's normal that they just go on
    vacation. And that's another thing. If nobody stops you, you can just work 24x7.

    thing is that you just pay income tax. If you have a company, you have to pay
    tax on the revenue, but here it's just that [income]. Actually, it's quite simple,
    you write a letter to your tax office and you tell them you're a freelancer. They
    asked me what is the estimate for my income for next year, and based on that,
    they say how much you pay in advance. Then you get a tax number for this activity,

- header: Effect of globalization and remote work on consulting
- line: Do you think the freelance market is affected by globalisation? Now everyone
    can work remotely. Why would a German company hire you instead of going to China
    or India or some other countries? The labor is cheaper there.

- line: "I guess yes. It also depends on what you want to do. If you're a front-end\
    \ freelancer, it's commoditized. There are websites where you can go if you want\
    \ to do a data science project. There, you're competing globally. But if you're\
    \ more specialised or if you have a name, then that's how you get it \u2014 because\
    \ everybody knows that it's super hard to find good data scientists."

- line: "It was also the reason why I started now. I always thought about it, but\
    \ then I thought I could never travel that much. If you have a number of clients,\
    \ you have to travel a lot. I didn't want to do that because of my family \u2014\
    \ small kids and so on."

- line: If you have clients from different parts of Germany, or Europe, or the world,
    then you would need to go on-site and talk to them. Now, since everyone is doing
    things remotely, you don't have to do that. Right?

  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I talked to big consulting companies, they say, "things really have changed".
    People understood that remote work also works.

- line: Before we wrap up, do you have any advice for people who want to start freelancing?
  sec: 3662
  time: '1:01:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Just try. Mostly data scientists are watching this. right. People are
    really looking super hard to find good data scientists. The market is really in
    our favour. If you have a good network and if you know people who would hire you
    if you quit, then there's a good chance. If you have enough money to try it out
    for a few months, just do it.

- header: Woking full-time and freelancing at the same time
- line: What do you think about freelancing and working at a company full-time at
    the same time? Is it realistic? If somebody wants to find out if freelancer is
    for them. If they think "We don't want to quit our job and have no certainty whether
    it will work out or not?"
  sec: 3731
  time: '1:02:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it wasn't realistic. When I had a job, I had no energy left. Maybe
    if you're young... Also if you're already working full-time, it's hard to also
    work with the client during office hours.
  sec: 3755
  time: '1:02:35'
  who: Mikio
- line: Yeah, they want you to be present during office hours. So you need to find
    a client from the States or from Australia. And then you don't have a life [laughs].
