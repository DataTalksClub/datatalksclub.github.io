intro: 'Struggling to find a mentor — or wondering how to become one — in a fast-moving
  tech career? In this episode, Rahul Jain, a senior solutions engineer and data/AI
  leader with 15+ years driving enterprise data transformations and a career arc from
  mining engineering to data engineering and leadership, walks through practical mentoring
  strategies for tech professionals. We define mentoring (purpose, scope, types),
  explore early models like Thoughtworks’ sponsorship, and show how to find mentors
  through networks, platforms, and cold outreach — with concrete outreach best practices:
  specificity, background, and follow-up. Rahul covers preparing mentoring sessions
  (goals, agendas), mentoring formats (one-off advice vs long-term relationships),
  and how to start as a mentor using simple first steps and platforms. Topics include
  benefits of mentoring, transferable workplace guidance, developing people skills
  (empathy, listening), balancing technical work and leadership, tackling imposter
  syndrome, coaching vs managing, setting boundaries and paid mentorship, and maintaining
  development plans. Listen to gain actionable steps, templates, and mindset shifts
  to both secure meaningful mentorship and build a sustainable mentoring practice
  in your tech career.'

transcript:
- line: Thank you everyone for coming to today's event. This event is brought to you
    by Data Talks Club, which is a community of people interested in data. We have
    weekly events, and the ones we usually have on Tuesday are more technical and
    include presentations. This week we talked about AWS Glue DataBrew, a new service
    from AWS. We will take a break for a couple of weeks and then next month we will
    talk about model monitoring and a feature store called Feast.
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: We also have live podcast events on Friday like today. These are more like
    discussions, without slides, and they are usually just Q and A. Today the topic
    is mentoring. For this type of event we will also have a break and come back in
    the middle of January with a topic on writing. Then we will talk about a developer
    advocate role and machine learning operations in Europe.
  sec: 20
  time: 0:20
  who: Alexey
- line: If during today you have any questions, please ask them on Slido. Slido is
    a special platform for asking questions. I will now share the link with you in
    the chat, and you can click on it.
  sec: 72
  time: '1:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: We can start. Let me pull up my notes.
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Today the topic is mentoring, and we have a special guest, Rahul Jain. Rahul
    is a technical leader with 20 years of experience in building and running software
    products. He now leads the business intelligence and data engineering units at
    Omio, which is a ticket booking company. Rahul is also a mentor at the Mentoring
    Club, where he offers guidance and coaching to engineers and managers. This is
    why I reached out to him and asked him to share his experience with us.
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you Rahul for coming today. It is a pleasure to have you.
  sec: 159
  time: '2:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks Alexey for having me.
  sec: 165
  time: '2:45'
  who: Rahul
- line: Before we go into the main topic of mentoring, maybe you could tell us a bit
    about your background. Can you tell us about your journey so far?
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I grew up in India in different parts of northern India, and I graduated
    in 1999 in mining engineering. Not data mining but mining engineering. By the
    time I graduated I was no longer interested in pursuing a career in mining and
    became more interested in computers.
  sec: 177
  time: '2:57'
  who: Rahul
- line: Around that time there was an IT boom, so I took advantage of it and joined
    an Indian IT services company in Bangalore. I was there for about seven years
    as a Java programmer. Back then Java was almost like how Golang and Rust are today,
    the cool thing to do. I learned a lot and worked in different domains as part
    of a consulting company, mostly in finance but also in other areas.
  sec: 190
  time: '3:10'
  who: Rahul
- line: After spending seven years there, I moved to Singapore and joined Credit Suisse,
    an investment bank. That was probably my first experience in the data world because
    most of the products and technologies there were related to data, even though
    we did not call it big data at the time. I was part of a team called Market Data
    Ingest, where I worked on ETLs, although I did not know they were called ETLs
    back then.
  sec: 229
  time: '3:49'
  who: Rahul
- line: I spent six or seven years there, first as a back-end engineer and later as
    a team lead. Then I joined ThoughtWorks, a consulting company with offices around
    the world. They are very popular for deep engineering skills, and Martin Fowler
    is one of their employees. There, again, I worked in different domains but stayed
    close to data.
  sec: 247
  time: '4:07'
  who: Rahul
- line: About three years ago, I moved to Berlin to join Omio, which was called GoEuro
    at the time. We are a ticketing company. If you travel anywhere in Europe and
    now also in the US, you can go to our portal and book your tickets. When I joined,
    I was asked to lead the BI and data engineering team, and that has been my journey
    so far.
  sec: 289
  time: '4:49'
  who: Rahul
- line: It is an interesting experience, especially starting from mining.
  sec: 335
  time: '5:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, absolutely. It is kind of funny because I started with mining and now
    I am doing data mining, even though it is not called data mining anymore. Now
    it is data science.
  sec: 342
  time: '5:42'
  who: Rahul
- line: Today the topic is mentoring, and you are active in this area. You mentor
    people at the Mentoring Club. What does mentoring mean to you?
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: The traditional definition of mentoring is about having a partnership with
    someone who knows a bit more about a topic than you do. You reach out to them
    and build a supportive relationship, usually to answer questions or get guidance.
    For me, the definition is broader. It is about reaching out to someone for a different
    perspective.
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Rahul
- line: It could be about a problem you are trying to solve, a challenge you are facing,
    or a decision you are trying to make in your career. It is about getting an opinion
    from someone who might have an interesting perspective. In our industry it is
    especially important because we do not have a strong tradition of apprenticeship
    like in food, retail, or law.
  sec: 402
  time: '6:42'
  who: Rahul
- line: For the first few years we rarely work closely with someone who mentors us.
    That is why it is important to have someone to reach out to when navigating challenges.
  sec: 437
  time: '7:17'
  who: Rahul
- line: So for you, mentoring does not necessarily mean a long-term activity. It can
    be reaching out for advice, but it can also be something more formal, like an
    apprenticeship program at a company that lasts for a couple of years.
  sec: 459
  time: '7:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on your needs. Traditionally, and something I recommend, it is
    good to have a long-term mentoring relationship. But people often have small,
    very specific questions, and it is perfectly fine to reach out and get advice
    in that area too. The definition is not strict. It can be something short or something
    long, depending on what you need.
  sec: 475
  time: '7:55'
  who: Rahul
- line: If I am a Java developer and want to move into data analysis, I can reach
    out to someone and ask whether this is the right path for me. That can also be
    mentoring.
  sec: 491
  time: '8:11'
  who: Rahul
- line: Was mentoring an important part of your career so far?
  sec: 520
  time: '8:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: For the first ten years, no. That is the crazy thing. That is probably why
    I eventually got into mentoring, because I realized how big that gap was. For
    the first ten years I did not have a mentor. I did not even know what mentoring
    meant.
  sec: 528
  time: '8:48'
  who: Rahul
- line: My experience with mentoring, both as a mentor and a mentee, started when
    I joined ThoughtWorks. ThoughtWorks had a strong culture of having a sponsor or
    mentor for every employee. That is how I was introduced to the concept and how
    I started having mentors and mentees.
  sec: 542
  time: '9:02'
  who: Rahul
- line: How does it work? The moment you join, do you get a mentor who stays with
    you throughout your time at the company?
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: They experiment with different formats, but that is typically how it works.
    You are not always assigned a mentor; you are encouraged to find one yourself.
    If you cannot, the organization or the people team will help you.
  sec: 571
  time: '9:31'
  who: Rahul
- line: The mentor is usually not from your team because the idea is to get mentorship
    from someone who can offer an unbiased opinion about your career. It is advisable
    to have someone who is not your immediate manager, maybe someone from a different
    team.
  sec: 585
  time: '9:45'
  who: Rahul
- line: If you want to find a mentor, it is great when a company has a mentorship
    program. Having someone to talk to about your problems is very useful, especially
    because there are things you do not want to discuss with your manager. How can
    you find such a person?
  sec: 618
  time: '10:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is probably the most difficult part. You want someone who has relevant
    experience and can offer meaningful advice. You also want someone who can actually
    play the role of a mentor. Just because someone knows a topic does not mean they
    are good at mentoring.
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Rahul
- line: It is an iterative process. Rather than spending too much time up front searching
    for the perfect person, you may need to try a few people. You can ask around in
    your network, join a formal mentoring program if your company has one, or use
    your personal connections.
  sec: 663
  time: '11:03'
  who: Rahul
- line: There are also programs like the Mentoring Club, which make finding a mentor
    easier. Some people even reach out directly through LinkedIn to someone they know
    or have heard of and ask if they have time. But it takes a few iterations to find
    the right person.
  sec: 714
  time: '11:54'
  who: Rahul
- line: You mentioned reaching out to your network. I sometimes get messages like
    “Can you help me with this?” and I often cannot because I do not always have the
    required expertise. Sometimes it feels like people send the same message to everyone,
    hoping someone will respond. I think there is a better way to target a message
    to a specific person. How would you recommend doing this?
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is similar to building a relationship. Cold messages are unpredictable
    because the other person does not know you or whether they can help. Investing
    a bit in the relationship first is better. Join a meetup group, participate in
    a Slack community, or engage in discussions. The other person gets to know you
    a bit, and then you can reach out.
  sec: 784
  time: '13:04'
  who: Rahul
- line: If they have seen how you work or participate, they may be more open to the
    conversation. But I would also say do not be afraid to reach out if you have a
    good reason. Sending a thoughtful, specific message can be effective. And do not
    get discouraged if someone does not reply.
  sec: 809
  time: '13:29'
  who: Rahul
- line: Speaking of messages, sometimes I get cold emails that are really good. How
    should such an email look to increase the chances of getting a response?
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Being specific helps. If I get a message that says “Can you help me with something?”,
    I do not know whether I can help. It is more useful when someone explains who
    they are, what they are struggling with, and what they have already tried. Showing
    authenticity and effort makes a big difference.
  sec: 902
  time: '15:02'
  who: Rahul
- line: Sharing a bit about your background and explaining how you are navigating
    the challenge can also help.
  sec: 938
  time: '15:38'
  who: Rahul
- line: This experience as a mentee at ThoughtWorks at some point you also became
    a mentor yourself, right? First, you were a mentee, someone was helping you, but
    you spent quite a while there. At some point, you had enough experience to actually
    mentor somebody. What did this do to your career? Was it helpful at all, and what
    were the benefits for you as a mentor?
  sec: 957
  time: '15:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are quite a few benefits that I have seen over the last few years. First
    and foremost, just being able to help someone or share your experiences is a reward
    in itself because it is a way of giving back. I also felt it made me a better
    listener because you have to listen a lot.
  sec: 981
  time: '16:21'
  who: Rahul
- line: As a team lead, I lead a team, so mentoring also gives me perspective on leading
    a team and what that means. For example, if someone comes with a problem, I can
    relate that to my own experiences with my team. Finally, it has expanded my network.
    Being part of the Mentoring Club, I am connecting with other mentors, which is
    rewarding.
  sec: 1025
  time: '17:05'
  who: Rahul
- line: If somebody reaches out to you on a topic where you do not have experience,
    what do you usually do in that case?
  sec: 1078
  time: '17:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is simple. I just say I do not know and cannot help in that area, and then
    try to connect them with somebody who might be able to help.
  sec: 1084
  time: '18:04'
  who: Rahul
- line: Have you ever been in a situation where you did not know how to solve a problem
    but just by listening and asking questions, you were able to help them?
  sec: 1140
  time: '19:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I always try to do that. Quite often, someone reaches out from marketing
    or even construction. Initially, it feels like there is not much overlap, but
    giving a listening ear itself is part of mentorship. Often, by talking, people
    can solve their own problems.
  sec: 1152
  time: '19:12'
  who: Rahul
- line: Also, you can recognize common patterns. Even if they come from a different
    background, many social problems in the workplace are common. You can relate and
    say, "This is similar to what I have seen, here is what I did," and start connecting
    dots between different worlds.
  sec: 1192
  time: '19:52'
  who: Rahul
- line: These people from construction or other industries, did they find you through
    the Mentoring Club?
  sec: 1229
  time: '20:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 1241
  time: '20:41'
  who: Rahul
- line: Can you tell us a bit more about this club?
  sec: 1251
  time: '20:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'It was started earlier this year by a few colleagues in Berlin. The motivation
    was simple: to reach out to people who need career mentorship or coaching. It
    is grown to almost 300 mentors. I do not have exact numbers, but we have given
    close to a thousand sessions. It is completely free. You just book a session with
    a mentor.'
  sec: 1258
  time: '20:58'
  who: Rahul
- line: Mentors come from all walks of life. There are CXOs, people from product,
    tech, marketing, sales, design, entrepreneurs, and lots of different backgrounds.
  sec: 1301
  time: '21:41'
  who: Rahul
- line: Which topics do you help with on this platform?
  sec: 1327
  time: '22:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I help with career navigation, challenges at work, career decisions, switching
    careers, or deciding on higher education. I also talk about technical topics like
    data engineering stacks for startups. It varies.
  sec: 1335
  time: '22:15'
  who: Rahul
- line: If someone wants advice and wants to reach out to you through the Mentoring
    Club, how should they best prepare to get the most out of the session?
  sec: 1370
  time: '22:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on what you are looking for. If you have specific challenges, reach
    out to your mentor first and give as much detail as possible about your background
    and goals. Do a bit of introspection. Are you looking for a one-off session, validation
    of a decision, or a long-term engagement?
  sec: 1384
  time: '23:04'
  who: Rahul
- line: Do not over-prepare. It is not a job interview. Share the details and let
    the conversation flow. One misconception is expecting a specific answer. Mentoring
    is about pointers, planting seeds, probing deeper. It is a process.
  sec: 1442
  time: '24:02'
  who: Rahul
- line: Can you share an example from a recent session? What kind of problems do people
    approach you with?
  sec: 1503
  time: '25:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Some common areas. Imposter syndrome affects more than 50 to 60 percent of
    people who reach out. They feel they are not good enough. I also get questions
    about tech versus management, especially for people with five or six years in
    technology now being asked to take leadership roles. Other questions include career
    moves, whether to join a company or pursue higher education.
  sec: 1517
  time: '25:17'
  who: Rahul
- line: If someone comes to you with imposter syndrome, what do you usually recommend?
  sec: 1575
  time: '26:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: There is no one answer. Imposter syndrome can happen for various reasons.
    I usually go deeper into the root cause. Often it is a perception built by external
    or internal factors. The process is to scratch the surface, question beliefs,
    and help define the problem more specifically.
  sec: 1587
  time: '26:27'
  who: Rahul
- line: It seems to me that to be a good mentor, you really need to understand people
    and go deep to find the root cause. How do you learn that as a tech person, like
    a Java developer?
  sec: 1650
  time: '27:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: It helps to have a natural inclination to help people, which most people do.
    Early in your career, you spend energy as an individual contributor, but even
    then you help new team members onboard. Tech and data work are social activities,
    so you inadvertently develop people skills. You just need to hone them for mentoring.
  sec: 1682
  time: '28:02'
  who: Rahul
- line: Some aspects, like being a better listener or avoiding the “advice monster,”
    jumping immediately into giving advice, are learned over time. Mentoring is a
    skill that comes with practice, and you are likely already doing some of it at
    work.
  sec: 1755
  time: '29:15'
  who: Rahul
- line: So basically, do not be afraid of trying. It is not as difficult as it sounds.
  sec: 1796
  time: '29:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, not at all. It is very rewarding. It is not about sitting on a higher
    pedestal. It is about listening and helping others.
  sec: 1801
  time: '30:01'
  who: Rahul
- line: What are the main motivations for a mentor to mentor someone? You mentioned
    helping personally, seeing patterns, becoming a better listener, and the reward
    of helping someone. Is there anything else?
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Those are the main ones. It is also about expanding your perspective and network.
    You learn through mentoring while providing value to others.
  sec: 1840
  time: '30:40'
  who: Rahul
- line: Personally, for me, as I said earlier, for the first ten years I had no one
    to work with. I did not know what I was doing. I came from a mining background.
    There were no engineers or people in software in my family that I could talk to,
    and there was no culture of apprenticeship or mentorship in the first few years
    of my career. I struggled a lot. I did not know if Java was the best thing for
    me. I also went through imposter syndrome for many years.
  sec: 1846
  time: '30:46'
  who: Rahul
- line: For my personality, my motivation came from that experience. Since I did not
    have guidance, I wanted to provide that space for other people. You need to find
    your own motivation, but these were some things that motivated me.

- line: Through this mentoring club, some people just want a one-time conversation,
    but sometimes people need something more long-term. How often do you have somebody
    who wants long-term mentorship?
  sec: 1903
  time: '31:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Long-term mentorship is a little tricky. I have a few people I mentor long-term,
    some from ThoughtWorks and some from the mentoring club. You need to be mindful
    of the mentor’s time investment. Some mentors do it professionally and charge
    a fee.
  sec: 1918
  time: '31:58'
  who: Rahul
- line: Other than that, it is about establishing a clear agreement. If the mentor
    is interested and willing, long-term mentorship is very valuable because it helps
    understand the entire context over time.
  sec: 1970

- line: How do you set boundaries for long-term mentorship relationships?
  sec: 2028
  time: '33:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sometimes a paid relationship helps create boundaries and expectations. In
    unpaid long-term mentorship, it is about setting clear expectations. For example,
    tell mentees it is not meaningful to meet unless there is a change in their situation.
    Avoid diminishing returns.
  sec: 2052
  time: '34:12'
  who: Rahul
- line: Being mindful from both sides helps. Ask if the extra session will be beneficial
    before committing.

  sec: 2146
  time: '35:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Paid mentoring can be very beneficial. It can be more constructive and allows
    better expectations. It creates accountability and motivation from both sides.
    It is common for senior leaders but less so for early-career professionals. For
    less experienced people, paid mentorship often focuses on job preparation.

  sec: 2465
  time: '41:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Managers often have one-on-ones that are somewhat like mentorship but are
    delivery-focused. It is better to seek someone who is not your immediate manager
    for unbiased opinions. You can also have multiple mentors for different areas
    of your career. A mentor shows direction but does not make decisions for you.

## Background and journey

**Q: Could you walk us through your professional journey and share how you got to where you are today? What were the key turning points in your career?**

**Rahul:** Sure. I grew up in different parts of northern India and graduated in mining engineering in 1999—not data mining, but actual mining. By the time I graduated, I realized I wasn't interested in a mining career and was more drawn to computers. Luckily, the global IT boom was happening, so I joined an Indian IT services company in Bangalore and spent about seven years there as a Java programmer. Back then, Java was like Go or Rust today—the cool thing to do. I worked across domains, mostly finance.

After that, I moved to Singapore and joined Credit Suisse, an investment bank. That was my first real foray into the data world. Most products and technologies there were data-related—though we didn't call it "big data" yet. I worked on a team called Market Data Ingest, essentially doing ETL, though we didn't use that term then either. I spent six or seven years there, starting as a back-end engineer and later becoming a team lead.

Then I joined Thoughtworks, a consulting company known for its deep engineering culture—Martin Fowler is there. I worked across domains again but stayed close to data. About three years ago, I moved to Berlin to join Omio (formerly GoEuro), a ticketing company. If you're traveling in Europe—and now also in the US—you can book tickets on our portal. I was asked to lead the BI and Data Engineering team, and that's what I've been doing since. It's funny how I started with mining and now do "data mining," though today we call it data science.

## What is mentoring?

**Q: How would you define mentoring, and what role do you think it plays in professional development? What makes mentoring different from other types of professional relationships?**

**Rahul:** Traditionally, mentoring is a partnering relationship with someone who knows more about a topic than you do. You reach out, build a supportive relationship, and get help answering questions. I define it more loosely: it's reaching out for a different perspective—on a problem, a challenge, or a career decision—and getting input from someone whose viewpoint might help.

In tech, this is especially important. Unlike fields like food, retail, or law, we don’t have a strong apprenticeship tradition—those first years working closely with someone who guides you. So having someone to reach out to becomes crucial.

**Q: Does mentoring always need to be a long-term commitment, or can it be more flexible? What are the different types of mentoring relationships?**

**Rahul:** It depends on your needs. I recommend having a long-term mentoring relationship, but people often have small, specific questions too—and that's totally fine. It can be as simple as: "I'm a Java developer and want to move into data analysis—is this the right move for me?" That's also mentoring.

## Experiencing mentoring

**Q: Looking back at your career journey, what role did mentorship play in your professional development? When did you first experience mentoring?**

**Rahul:** For my first ten years, it didn't play much of a role—and that gap is part of why I got into mentoring. I didn't even know what mentoring was. That changed when I joined Thoughtworks, which has a rich culture around mentorship—every employee has a sponsor or mentor. That's when I started having both mentors and mentees.

**Q: Could you tell us more about how Thoughtworks structured their mentoring program and what made it effective? What were the key components?**

**Rahul:** You're encouraged to find a mentor yourself; if you can't, the people team can help. Typically, your mentor isn't from your immediate team. The idea is to get impartial guidance, so it's better if the person isn't your manager.

## Finding a mentor

**Q: What advice would you give to someone looking to find a mentor outside of formal mentorship programs? Where should they start?**

**Rahul:** That's often the hardest part. You want someone with relevant experience who can offer actionable advice—and who can actually play the role of a mentor. It's iterative: don't spend ages searching for the "perfect" person; try a few. Ask in your network. If your company has a program, use it. Otherwise, personal networks and platforms like The Mentoring Club make it easier. I've also seen people reach out directly on LinkedIn. It may take a few tries before you find the right fit.

**Q: Do you have any advice for reaching out to potential mentors you don't know personally? What makes for an effective cold outreach message?**

**Rahul:** Building a relationship first helps. Participate in communities—meetups, Slack groups like DataTalks.Club—so people see how you contribute. Then reach out. But don't be afraid of a well-crafted cold message either. Be specific: who you are, what you're struggling with, what you've already tried, and what question you need help with. Share some background. Vague "can you help?" messages are hard to respond to. Specificity and authenticity go a long way—and don't be discouraged if someone doesn't reply. Keep trying.

## Benefits of being a mentor

**Q: From your experience as a mentor, what are the main benefits you've gained personally and professionally? How has mentoring impacted your own career development?**

**Rahul:** There are several. First, helping someone and sharing experiences is rewarding—it's a way to pay it forward. It's also made me a better listener; mentoring requires careful listening. As a team lead, mentoring gives me perspective on my own leadership—when someone brings me a challenge, I can reflect on whether I'm creating similar issues for my team. Finally, it's expanded my network; through The Mentoring Club, I've connected with many other mentors.

There's another subtle benefit: pattern recognition. Five people may bring different problems, but you start recognizing common themes underneath—imposter syndrome is a big one. You become sensitized to these broader issues and start noticing them in your own team and environment.

## Mentoring beyond your domain

**Q: Is it possible to effectively mentor someone outside your area of expertise? Can you share examples of how you've navigated situations where you weren't familiar with the mentee's domain?**

**Rahul:** Absolutely. People reach out from marketing, construction—fields far from my background. At first it feels like there's no overlap, but simply offering a listening ear is part of mentorship; sometimes that alone helps them clarify their thinking. Many workplace issues are universal. I might say, "I don't know your environment exactly, but this sounds similar to something I've seen; here's what I did." You look for connections you can make.

## The Mentoring Club

**Q: Could you tell us about The Mentoring Club? What is it, how did it start, and how does the platform work for both mentors and mentees?**

**Rahul:** It started earlier this year in Berlin, founded by a few of my (now ex-)colleagues. The motivation was simple: reach people who need career mentorship or coaching. It's grown to around 300 mentors and roughly a thousand sessions (if not more). It's completely free: you book a session with a mentor and then it's between you and them. Mentors come from product, tech, marketing, sales, design, entrepreneurship—many are CXOs across Europe and beyond.

**Q: What are the specific areas or topics you typically help people with in your mentoring sessions? What kinds of challenges do people bring to you most often?**

**Rahul:** Career navigation: workplace challenges, career decisions, switching tracks, whether to pursue higher education. I also cover technical topics from my recent background in data engineering—e.g., data stacks for startups.

## Preparing for mentoring sessions

**Q: What advice would you give to someone preparing for their first (or next) mentoring session? How can mentees get the most value from their time with a mentor?**

**Rahul:** A common pattern: first, contact the mentor with context—your background and what you're looking for. Take time to reflect: what do you want from the session—one-off idea-bouncing, validation of a decision, or a longer-term relationship? Don't over-prepare; it's not a job interview. Share the basics and let the conversation flow. One common misconception: people expect very specific, definitive answers. Often there isn't one. A mentor's job is to offer pointers, probe deeper, and plant seeds—to help you think. It's a process; understanding that helps set realistic expectations.

## Common mentoring challenges

**Q: Based on your experience, what are the most common challenges or concerns people bring to mentoring sessions? Are there recurring patterns you've noticed?**

**Rahul:** Imposter syndrome—more than half the people who reach out feel "not good enough." Another big one is tech vs. management. After five or six years, people are nudged toward leadership and worry it's a binary choice: people management vs. hands-on tech. And of course, career moves: which company, whether to do a degree, and so on.

There's no single answer to imposter syndrome. Imposter feelings have different root causes. My process is to go deeper: what's underneath? Often it's a perception shaped by external factors, sometimes internal ones. We scratch the surface, question beliefs, and try to define the feeling more specifically. "I'm not good enough"—what does that actually mean in your context? The "advice" emerges from understanding the root, not from a template.

## Learning people skills for mentoring

**Q: Mentoring requires strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence. How can technically-focused professionals develop these softer skills to become effective mentors?**

**Rahul:** A natural inclination to help is useful, but most people have it. Work is social—even programming and data work are team sports. You onboard newcomers and help colleagues, so you already practice people skills, even if you don't label them that way. Then there are learnable "tricks of the trade": be a better listener, avoid becoming the "advice monster" (as a colleague calls it), don't jump straight to solutions. It's a skill that grows with practice. If you look closely, you're probably already doing parts of it—mentoring just takes it to the next level.

## Balancing tech and leadership

**Q: Many people worry that as they take on more leadership and mentoring responsibilities, they'll lose their technical edge. What's your perspective on this, and how do you personally balance technical work with people leadership?**

**Rahul:** I get this question a lot. It's rare to remain a pure individual contributor forever. As you gain experience, you naturally help others. The myth is that you must choose: people leadership/mentoring **or** tech. In reality, these worlds converge. I still write code almost every day while leading a team, doing stakeholder management, and joining architecture deep dives. You can shape your day—decide your own mix of coding versus people work. In most companies (and as a freelancer), that balance is manageable. Don't surrender control of your time; define it.

The key is accepting that a blended path is viable. Once you commit to that, you can design your schedule. The ratio won't be identical every day, but over time you can delegate more, create space, and keep coding. The first step is the mindset shift: there's nothing wrong with wanting both, and you can make it work.

## Q&A from the Audience

### Mentor motivations

**Q: Beyond the obvious benefit of helping others, what drives people to become mentors? What have been your personal motivations for taking on this role?**

**Rahul:** Several things: you become a better listener, you start seeing patterns across different problems, and it's intrinsically rewarding to help. For me, there's also a personal reason—for my first ten years, I had no mentor. I came from mining, had no software people in my family, no apprenticeship culture, lots of uncertainty, and years of imposter syndrome. My motivation is to provide the support I didn't have. Everyone will find their own reason, but those are mine.

### Long-term mentoring and finding mentors

**Q: What are your thoughts on long-term versus one-off mentoring relationships? And is it better to find a mentor within your organization or look externally?**

**Rahul:** I have a few long-term mentees—from Thoughtworks and the club—but it's tricky. Time investment matters, and sometimes long-term mentorship becomes a paid relationship. Many mentors do it professionally. One-off sessions are fine; for long-term relationships, align on expectations—sometimes that includes a fee. I recommend longer relationships because you can't grasp the full context in one call. Getting to know each other over time makes the work more productive.

As for finding mentors within your company—not necessarily. If your organization has a program or people you can approach, that's great. Otherwise, external mentors can be equally (sometimes more) unbiased and helpful.

**Q: There's often confusion about the distinction between a manager and a mentor. Can your manager effectively serve as your mentor, or should these be separate roles?**

**Rahul:** Managers run 1:1s and handle delivery and career topics, but their role isn't fully neutral. It's advisable to also have a mentor who isn't your manager—they can be more unbiased (they can even say "quit this job," which a manager likely won't). Also, don't limit yourself to one mentor. Build a small "personal board of directors" for different needs (e.g., domain guidance, leadership, identity-related perspective).

**Q: Long-term mentoring relationships can be wonderful but also complex. What advice do you have for setting healthy boundaries and expectations on both sides?**

**Rahul:** Start with clear expectations. Paid setups often make boundaries easier—both sides commit and know what to expect. Even in unpaid cases, I'll say, "Let's not meet again unless something changes," because weekly chats without progress have diminishing returns. I'll ask, "What's different from last month?" If the answer is "nothing," we skip that session. Both sides need to be mindful of this.

### Paid mentorship

**Q: There's sometimes debate about whether mentorship should be free or paid. What are your thoughts on paid mentorship, and do you think compensation changes the dynamic or effectiveness of the relationship?**

**Rahul:** Absolutely—it can be more constructive and accountable. Like a gym membership: if it works for you and is fairly priced, it increases commitment and goal clarity on both sides. It's more common for senior leaders (e.g., CXOs). For early-career folks, I see fewer paid, long-term mentorships, though paid interview prep or tech coaching is more common.

If you provide real value, there's nothing wrong with charging—just like training in data science or engineering. Paid setups often clarify expectations and boundaries. Some people even do this full-time. If mentees benefit and you deliver value, it's a valid path.

### Building meaningful mentoring relationships

**Q: Mentoring works best when it's more than just a Q&A session. How can mentees cultivate a genuine, reciprocal relationship with their mentors rather than treating it as a one-way advice channel?**

**Rahul:** Treat it like any relationship. Invest over time and be authentic. Don't treat it like a job interview or a highlight reel—share challenges, strengths, and weaknesses. Periodically run a small retrospective: what's working, what isn't, what do you need more of (e.g., book suggestions, frameworks, exercises)? Co-create the approach.

### Starting as a mentor

**Q: Does your mentoring approach differ when working with junior professionals versus senior leaders? Do you need different skills or techniques for each?**

**Rahul:** Not really. The problem spaces differ, but the depth of struggle is similar. The approach—listening, probing, pattern-spotting—remains the same.

**Q: For someone who's interested in becoming a mentor but doesn't know where to start, what practical first steps would you recommend? How can they begin their mentoring journey?**

**Rahul:** Start by reaching out to your network, but don't give unsolicited advice. Offer support as an option: "I'm here if you want to talk through something." If you want a formal path, join a platform like The Mentoring Club (there are others, like Plato). Skill-wise: lead with empathy, listen more than you talk, and remember that people's contexts differ from yours. Avoid the "advice monster"; ask good questions first. It's learnable, and you get better with practice.

### Personal development and well-being

**Q: Many personal development plans are created with good intentions but end up forgotten. What's your approach to building and actually following through on a development plan with a manager or mentor?**

**Rahul:** It depends on your goals; format matters less than follow-through. Most plans fail because we don't revisit them. Review the plan together regularly—weekly 1:1s or monthly check-ins. Keep it visible so it doesn't gather dust. Planning is easy; practice and process are the hard parts.

**Q: This is a bit personal, but many people struggle with feeling overwhelmed at work. How do you personally deal with these feelings, and has mentoring changed your perspective on managing stress and overwhelm?**

**Rahul:** I'd love to say "take a break and reprioritize," but I don't always do that well myself. Overwhelm is a mental state; go a layer deeper. What's driving it—fear of a tough meeting? Too much work? Decisions piling up? Name the source, then break it into pieces you can tackle. Mentoring has made me reflect more on how I handle this and become more empathetic when others face it.
