title: Recruiting Data Engineers
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about recruiting data engineers. We have a special guest
    today Nicolas. Nicolas is a technical recruiter who is hiring for a wide variety
    of engineering and AI roles. He worked for many years as an in-house recruiter
    for companies in retail. Welcome Nicolas to our event.
  sec: 47
  time: 0:47
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Thanks for having me.
  sec: 72
  time: '1:12'
  who: Nicolas
- header: Nicolas’ background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of recruiting data engineers, let's start
    with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 75
  time: '1:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yep. In terms of education, I've studied international business for several
    years. Then I did a Master's degree in HR. That was a broad topic. Then I started
    my career in the tech industry. I've been working for the tech industry, really,
    since the beginning. I first joined after graduation, a company called Criteo
    – they are leaders in online digital advertising and personalized advertising.
    Here, I started as a sourcer, also known as a recruiter, and I've been hiring
    for different kinds of roles. Most of them were software engineering and I had
    a focus on anything data, so recruitment for data analysts, data engineering,
    data science, machine learning engineering, and also research scientists as well.
  sec: 83
  time: '1:23'
  who: Nicolas
- line: I helped build the AI Lab of these companies, which is pretty successful.
    Since last year, I've joined a company called Onfido, which is a British company.
    Basically, they are in the field of online identity verification. Here, I’m doing
    pretty much the same thing. Both companies are very data and machine learning
    oriented/focused. Here, I'm working and hiring for four different locations across
    Europe.
  sec: 83
  time: '1:23'
  who: Nicolas
- line: Which countries?
  sec: 190
  time: '3:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: We have the UK. Then we are hiring in France, Portugal, Netherlands and Germany.
    Maybe more soon, we hope.
  sec: 192
  time: '3:12'
  who: Nicolas
- line: You said you were hiring – maybe it was for Criteo – but you said you were
    hiring research scientists. But now at Onfido, what kind of roles and levels do
    you recruit for?
  sec: 206
  time: '3:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For now, we are hiring for mostly I would say, intermediate to senior
    levels in terms of profiles. Literally I have a bit of everything. I do hire backend,
    frontends, I do DevOps, I do security engineering, I do research. I also work
    on the data analytics piece. You can have BI analytics, data engineering, and
    we are also hiring for machine learning engineering. Basically, I'm just hiring
    for everything for software. I'm not really working for products, for example,
    roles at the moment. But I can help if needed.
  sec: 220
  time: '3:40'
  who: Nicolas
- header: The tech talent market in different countries
- line: You mentioned that you are looking for candidates in four countries – the
    UK, France, Portugal and Germany. I’m wondering how different are the candidates
    that you find in these countries and processes? Is it the same or different? Did
    you see any differences in these countries?
  sec: 273
  time: '4:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. This is more about the market, really. The UK and London, more than 10
    years ago, I would say was the place for tech. Then Berlin grew a lot, and Paris
    too. Obviously, the Netherlands, as well. But you do have some countries where
    you have a more lively tech scene, I would say. Portugal is also doing pretty
    well, over the last few years. For me, I would say the difference is more the
    number of tech companies that you have. We could observe a difference like 5-10
    years ago. Now, it's less different.
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Nicolas
- line: I imagine in London, when you hireded people, you needed to compete with all
    the big names – all the big tech companies, right? But in Berlin, you mostly compete
    with startups. Maybe this is the difference.
  sec: 362
  time: '6:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but it depends. Because now you have companies hiring across different
    countries, you have less and less borders, especially in Europe. In the end, for
    example, when you hire within the EU, whether you hire for example, in Germany,
    it's not only Berlin – you can hire someone who's basically anywhere in the country.
    But yeah, there’s competition in the sense that you have more and more companies
    – more and more high-demand jobs as well. Now it tends to be borderless recruitment.
  sec: 375
  time: '6:15'
  who: Nicolas
- header: Hiring data scientists vs data engineers
- line: Okay. Interesting. Actually, the reason I reached out to you a couple of weeks
    ago and invited you to this podcast is because we had a different podcast episode
    that was about hiring data professionals – where we talked to Alicia, who was
    a guest here – but we mostly talked about data scientists. Then some people reached
    out to me saying, “Hey, that was a cool episode, but we want to hear more about
    data engineers.” So here we go.
  sec: 419
  time: '6:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'We’re talking about hiring data engineers, but I also wanted to ask you –
    you are recruiting for a wide range of positions: ML engineers, data scientists,
    data analysts, data engineers – in your opinion, what is the main difference between
    hiring data scientists and data engineers?'
  sec: 419
  time: '6:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I would say that there's two different things. You have kind of a ratio
    between tech and business, in terms of skills. After all, it really depends. In
    data science, you have data analysts who call themselves data scientists and vice
    versa. For me, a data scientist is someone who will work on things like feature
    engineering, for example. So you don't have the same ratio between tech and business
    in terms of skills. The other thing is really that, as we've seen in the last
    five or six years, there’s this very big hype about data science. We've seen that
    it was purported to be one of the hardest jobs, or one of the most high demand
    jobs in the market. So the difference, I would say, is that for a data science
    role, I have plenty of applications, because you have this hype around it.
  sec: 468
  time: '7:48'
  who: Nicolas
- line: For data engineering, it's less so. It’s starting to be hyped, though. To
    me, this is also something that is in the natural order of things, really. Because
    when you have companies who would much prefer to hire data scientists in the last
    years – now some of them realize that maybe it could be a good idea to have engineers
    that will deal with the data and data pipelines and all these spots. So to me,
    this is really in the natural order of things. The other thing is that, we’re
    also seeing lots of universities and engineering schools providing data science-specific
    tech training and diplomas, which is not at the same level nowadays. I'm not sure
    there's that many purely data engineering Bachelor’s degrees or Master’s degrees.
    I mean, not yet.
  sec: 468
  time: '7:48'
  who: Nicolas
- line: If it follows the same trend as data scientists, this should happen pretty
    soon. For me those are the main two differences. Yeah. One is much more hyped
    up than the other one and we don't necessarily have formal training for being
    a data engineer. I'm sure it's gonna happen, but you have to be a bit patient.
  sec: 468
  time: '7:48'
  who: Nicolas
- line: I think data science was quite commonly romanticized like, “This is the perfect
    job where all you do is machine learning.”
  sec: 666
  time: '11:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, like “This is the job of the century – machine learning, AI, etc.” But
    in the end, if you don't have data, and if it's not well organized – you don’t
    take good care of the pipelines and the data – data is the key for data science.
    So that's why they just ask “Oh, yeah, I need a professional to handle these parts.”
  sec: 676
  time: '11:16'
  who: Nicolas
- line: To summarize what I heard from you – the first thing is that there is this
    balance between technology and business. You see more business in data science
    roles compared to data engineering roles. And the second thing is data science
    is pretty much still hyped – you see a lot more applications for data science
    roles, but for the engineering positions you receive fewer applications at the
    moment, so there is less competition. Is that right?
  sec: 716
  time: '11:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. And the candidates know a bit less about data engineering than data
    science as well. Because as you said, you have all this storytelling and communication.
    Especially some companies that say, “Oh, yeah! We're doing machine learning with
    AI.” And in the end it’s just some ‘if and else’, [chuckles] they’re not very
    advanced models. So you also had these marketing things. It’s the same for schools
    and universities, “Yeah! We have a brand new data science degree!” So they kind
    of play with this.
  sec: 747
  time: '12:27'
  who: Nicolas
- header: A spike in interest for data engineering roles
- line: Have you observed a spike of interest in data engineering roles recently?
    I am judging from the blog posts that I see on the internet. For a year, maybe
    a bit longer, I've seen posts on Hacker News, and in general, Reddit and on social
    media, that you don't need data scientists and you need data engineers. So companies
    realize that data engineers are actually needed – they are in demand – and more
    people learn about this role this way. Have you seen a spike of interest in data
    engineering roles?
  sec: 794
  time: '13:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I would say that I definitely have. We've seen more and more content
    where people are sharing about what they're doing. For me, that's also a trend
    that the big tech companies started. Basically, the FANG companies were the first
    to process huge amounts of data and were able to process a lot of it and analyze
    a lot of data as well. In parallel, we’ve seen that there were more and more tools
    that were available in the markets – open source ones or proprietary ones – that
    were helping to process more to analyze more. This definitely also helped, I would
    say.
  sec: 830
  time: '13:50'
  who: Nicolas
- line: Then you have all the cloud computing parts, like the Hadoop ecosystem. And
    so we continue to have more and more tools to automate. Data engineering is progressing
    a lot, it seems, and even the data engineering job is changing as well. Before
    you were doing a lot of things manually, but for a certain amount of data, or
    if you have very complex data, that’s not viable and that’s why you have these
    ecosystems that are used a lot. You also have like this change of some work and
    some jobs when you have more automation and more optimization of the processes.
  sec: 830
  time: '13:50'
  who: Nicolas
- header: The importance of recruiters having  technical knowledge
- line: I'm wondering, as a recruiter who recruits for data engineering roles, and
    in general, for technical roles – how much of this stuff do you need to know?
    You seem to know quite a lot already, because we're talking about quite technical
    things with you. So do you need to know things like what ETL is, what cloud computing
    is, what ARC, what Fling is, what Python is? You mentioned “It's not AI, it's
    a bunch of if/then statements.” As a recruiter, how much of this do you actually
    need to know to be successful?
  sec: 960
  time: '16:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Okay. First, I'd say it depends on the recruiter. For me, I'm passionate
    about technology. Each time I'm talking with someone like an engineer and have
    some stuff I don’t, I just always ask. I'm also just curious by nature. For me,
    it's important to know the concepts. For example, it helps to reduce the number
    of candidates who can ascend to a role like hiring manager without the relevant
    experience. For example, I know what cloud computing is – I know the big picture
    of how it works, but more on the high level. If you ask me exactly what the inner
    details are – I don't know, because this is not my job. But you need to understand
    the big picture.
  sec: 997
  time: '16:37'
  who: Nicolas
- line: It really helps me to spot very quickly, if someone’s experience is relevant
    for the job or for the project. It also helps me, for example, when I choose some
    resumes, I'd say, “Oh, I'm not sure this candidate would fit or match in this
    role, or this part of the tech organization, but this candidate might be interesting
    for another one.” So I would say yes, it's better to know. Also, you have some
    credibility as well. Because imagine if you're an engineer and you talk to a recruiter
    who doesn't know anything – even the basics. So you also have this image and credibility.
    That is also important, in my opinion.
  sec: 997
  time: '16:37'
  who: Nicolas
- header: The main challenges of hiring data engineers
- line: In your opinion, what are the main difficulties? What are the main challenges
    of hiring data engineers?
  sec: 1127
  time: '18:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: So, as I mentioned before, there's no formal training for it – no official
    diplomas. If you're looking for someone who is a senior, generally, you're gonna
    have candidates and engineers who are coming from software engineering, BI, or
    from some other roles. I've seen some engineers that come from data science, and
    they realized after a couple of years, “Oh, yeah. Actually, I like the data piece
    more than the rest.” I would say that's one of the challenges.
  sec: 1136
  time: '18:56'
  who: Nicolas
- line: I think the second one is pretty classic – in the market, it's very high demand.
    You have a lot of jobs as well that are close to data engineering, but that are
    not data engineering in the sense of what data engineers are working on right
    now. Sometimes you can have someone that is very senior, but hasn't worked on
    the classic data engineering problems that you can have. For me, I would say that’s
    one of the difficulties. So you really have to see and understand what the candidate
    is doing and what they want to do in the future.
  sec: 1136
  time: '18:56'
  who: Nicolas
- line: I imagine that you get a bunch of applications – or you reach out to a bunch
    of people – who do not yet have the title of data engineer in their portfolio,
    like a data scientist, BI engineer, software engineer. It seems like they're doing
    something irrelevant, but you need to find out if this is actually relevant. I
    imagine there are already a lot of software engineers that are building data pipelines
    – they just don't know that they're doing data engineering.
  sec: 1257
  time: '20:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. I mean, you can have that with data science as well. You can
    have people who have data scientist as a title, but they are only doing R or MATLAB,
    for example, or R and SQL. But yeah, that's one of the reasons. I would also say
    that, although the job title is important, to me, the most important thing is
    really what you are doing on the job and the kind of projects you are working
    on. I've seen some people with a software engineering title and they've been working
    on Hadoop, or a combo of Hadoop, Spark, and Scala stuff. Yeah, it is software
    engineering, but you could have called yourself a data engineer.
  sec: 1286
  time: '21:26'
  who: Nicolas
- line: It's the same when you have some people who call themselves a BI engineer,
    but they are doing data engineering. So, hopefully, the more we're going to talk
    about data engineering, the more training there is, the more blog posts there
    are, etc. I do hope that people will realize that “Oh, in the end, I'm doing data
    engineering.” I think there's a bit of branding still to be done.
  sec: 1286
  time: '21:26'
  who: Nicolas
- header: The difference in hiring junior, mid, and senior level data engineers
- line: Do you think there are a lot of differences between hiring junior data engineers,
    middle level data engineers, and senior engineers? [cross-talk]
  sec: 1375
  time: '22:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Definitely. I would say that junior engineers are very task-oriented.
    When you start working as a data engineer and join a team, they will say, “Okay,
    we have these projects and this task –and you're gonna do it.” When you move to
    someone who's an intermediate level, they are not only task-oriented, but they
    are more proactive in the sense that they have a pretty good understanding of
    programming, they are able to make some design decisions, and they can manage
    some project with ambiguity, when you have some complexity. In the end, they start
    to take on their own projects. It really also depends on the size of the company
    you work for, the type of the company you work for. They might have some focus
    on designing new products or to improve some system flows, for example.
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Nicolas
- line: For the senior level – when you're a senior data engineer, of course, you
    have the skills – you should have expert technical expertise. This, combined with
    the number of years of experience, you're basically able to manage a bunch of
    products. You have better reflexes and know what to do depending on the case or
    on the technical situation. Basically with the multiplication of the trial and
    the error you’ve made like, “Oh yeah. I remember that pretty well. I already did
    that.” Or like, “Here, I did that pretty poorly.” And of course, to finish – you
    have the influence. You have influence on the technical decision, also you have
    influence on the way of doing things, and influence over the less senior data
    engineers. So this is also like a grower in the influence zone, I would say.
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Nicolas
- line: When you actually recruit them – when they go through the recruitment process
    – I imagine at the beginning, they have a call with you (the recruiter) at the
    initial first stage of the interview. I imagine that for each of these levels,
    you would have a different approach. Right? You said the seniors are more task
    oriented – then maybe you would just ask about the things they did, the technologies
    they know.
  sec: 1553
  time: '25:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Then maybe for the intermediate level, you would maybe ask about cases when
    they showed this proactiveness that you talked about – when they made a design
    decision. Then for a senior, you would ask them how they showed this influence
    that you talk about? Is this a correct assessment?
  sec: 1553
  time: '25:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So the goal in the recruitment process – you have a framework. The process
    is the same but, of course, you do not expect the same whether you're talking
    to a junior or a senior engineer. For junior candidates, yes. What I've seen in
    general, in terms of recruitment process, you have different steps. Of course,
    you always have an intro call with a recruiter. Here, it's more about getting
    to know each other like, “What are you working on right now?” What the company
    I’m recruiting for is doing, etc.
  sec: 1598
  time: '26:38'
  who: Nicolas
- line: Then, usually, it depends on companies, but you have a first discussion with
    someone from the data engineering team. Here, it's more about talking a bit more
    in detail on the candidate’s current project. After that, you have this mix of
    technical interviews, during which you have a coding interview. Of course, the
    coding interview is data oriented.
  sec: 1598
  time: '26:38'
  who: Nicolas
- line: The last one is certainly a bit more of a practical, analytical exercise.
    For example, when you start as a junior data engineer and you talk to someone
    like the hiring manager, for example, something that is important is also to care
    about the business. Because as a data engineer, you talk with different kinds
    of stakeholders and you also have to understand the business. Of course, if you
    are more senior, you will be able – on any technical question or discussion –
    to be able to say, “Why would you do it this way and not that way? What would
    be the drawbacks and what would be the benefits?”
  sec: 1598
  time: '26:38'
  who: Nicolas
- line: You need to be able to explain the different trade-offs – trade-offs, in terms
    of time, money, and performance as well. So the more senior you are and the more
    you tackle all these problems, you can say, “Oh, for this kind of problem, I would
    go for this solution,” and explain why this solution. But also to be able to say,
    “Okay, this solution might work, but you might have some drawbacks and some bottlenecks.”
    So you have to be aware of all this. Of course, it is not something that you can
    necessarily ask of someone who is just starting the job, because the goal is to
    multiply the technical challenges that you find during your career. The more you
    tackle them and the better reflexes you have like, “Oh, yeah. I already had a
    similar problem. Now I know what to do.” So basically, what we expect from junior,
    intermediate, or senior has to reflect on what we ask during the recruitment process.
    So you have a parallel between the two.
  sec: 1598
  time: '26:38'
  who: Nicolas
- header: Things recruiters look for in people who switch to a data engineering role
- line: There is a related question. We talked about different levels – talking about
    people who are switching to data engineering. What do you look for in these people?
    I think you did mention one thing – for people who are just starting their career
    in data engineering, they need to care about the business and do some research
    about the domain of the company that they’re interviewing for, right? Are there
    other things you look for in these candidates who are just getting started in
    data engineering?
  sec: 1839
  time: '30:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. There’s several things. First, I would say that it helps a
    lot if you have done internships, for example. That's a good way to start. Now,
    there are a lot of online trainings coming up in resumes, whether it's on their
    own, with different technologies – the basics and data engineering use cases.
    This is also a good start. On technical skills, I don't need someone who's going
    to put on their resume, like 40 or 50 different skills. I prefer to have a reduced
    number of technologies and tools that were used – that you really used. If someone
    asked you a question in an interview about this or this tool – you should be able
    to answer.
  sec: 1876
  time: '31:16'
  who: Nicolas
- line: Basically, on the resume for data engineering, of course, you have SQL, Python.
    I would say, this is the bare minimum. Also, in terms of projects, if I put myself
    in the shoes of candidates, it's really important to have a balance – whether
    it’s your resume or LinkedIn – to have the right balance between, no details and
    too much information. Because recruiters, we're kind of lazy [chuckles] so we
    like to read quickly – to go straight to the point. I do check for projects, whether
    it's an internship or a project that you've done on your own. Also, a thing that
    is important – if you’ve done an internship, whether it's a startup or a bigger
    company, post about what kind of problems and what kind of data you've been dealing
    with, as well. In general, I would say (except some companies) the data engineering
    problems look very similar.
  sec: 1876
  time: '31:16'
  who: Nicolas
- line: The exception is when you have a massive amount of data – that’s where it
    complicates things and it's a bit more specific. For example, if you go to companies
    like Criteo, for example, the amount of data is huge. Here it was pretty specific.
    Yeah, but here, for example, at Onfido, we have less data – but privacy is at
    the core of the data. Privacy and security in general is at the core of the data.
    If there's anything specific as well, that's the main thing that I'm looking at.
    Generally, I don't pay that much attention to the title. [laughs] Maybe I'm one
    of the few. But yeah, I'd say be precise and have some details and say, “Okay,
    the company is doing this. I've worked on these projects. I've used this tool.
    That was the problem and this was the outcome.”
  sec: 1876
  time: '31:16'
  who: Nicolas
- line: Yeah, so speaking of titles, you just mentioned that you don't really care
    about them. But I imagine that right now, many data scientists, many software
    engineers, BI engineers, data analysts, see this interest in data engineering
    roles. They see this demand for data engineering roles and they want to switch,
    right? For these people, who may already have several years of experience – maybe
    even more than five years working in IT in these roles – they are not really starting
    from scratch compared to somebody who is fresh out of university.
  sec: 2107
  time: '35:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Do you think these people should also apply for junior positions – let's say
    somebody who currently works as a data scientist. Or should they go directly to
    the usual intermediate or senior data engineer roles?
  sec: 2107
  time: '35:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you're someone who has a lot of years of experience, like backend, full
    stack or BI engineering, I think you can start with a junior role. To me the thing
    that is very important when you apply is to see how the team is. Because it happens,
    once you're just starting to work at a company and have like 10 years experience
    that’s not necessarily related to data engineering, but you will be the one handling
    all of the data piece, it might be complicated. Most companies, like startups
    and ones that don’t have a particularly huge amount of data or a privacy focus,
    the projects and the way data engineering is done doesn't change that much, it
    seems. You’ve got to start somewhere, but I would say the first thing is really
    to go and check on the internet how the team handles their cases and projects
    in order to start having your own reflexes.

  who: Nicolas
- line: So then you can say “Oh, yeah – for this kind of problem, I've already tried
    some things. I've seen some tutorials and videos.” I saw that you have a webinar
    coming in May. So hopefully this will be useful to you to get more insights. I
    would say when you just go for data engineering, there are three things you have
    to keep in mind. Now, data engineering is Python, mostly – so get yourself into
    Python. If you're more of a coder just check on SQL you can see all the different
    tools that you can have like Tableau, Looker and all those things. And also care
    about the business, because data engineering is not only “Oh, yeah – I'm just
    coding or doing some tech stuff.” You're also going to talk with data analysts
    and you're gonna talk with BI people, analysts, etc. since you serve the business.
  sec: 2161
  time: '36:01'
  who: Nicolas
- line: That will be my advice – SQL, Python, the basics of data engineering, and
    also care about the business, because you have an impact as a data engineer on
    the business. After you, the data is used by data scientists, business analysts,
    and even sales. You have to always have in your mind that these people will rely
    on you.

- header: The importance of knowing cloud tools
- line: How important is it for data engineers to know cloud tools like AWS, Google
    Cloud Platform, and others? Most of the jobs, at least from what I see in Berlin,
    require that to some extent. For the rest of Europe, is that also what you see?
  sec: 2381
  time: '39:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Generally, for the companies I've worked for, we were mostly tech-agnostic.
    For example, for cloud, if the company is using GCP and you only know AWS –that's
    fine. You know how cloud computing works and I think that's the most important
    thing. It's the same if you use Looker and not Tableau – okay, it's different,
    but there’s some stuff that is similar as well. For me, you don't have to know
    all of the technologies – you have to understand how they are used and why. Then
    you just have a bunch of differences with the different features that they have.
    For me, it's not really important.
  sec: 2406
  time: '40:06'
  who: Nicolas
- line: But, of course, if you say on your resume, “Oh, yeah – I’m an expert with
    Tableau. I know Tableau.” Maybe I’ll ask you a specific question about Tableau.
    So you should be able to answer that. Just don't pretend you’re an expert and
    that you've used all the tools, etc. No one is super human. Or if you are, at
    least hide it [chuckles]. So for me, it's not that important, but if you have
    used similar ones – you really used them and you have knowledge about them – this
    is the most important thing, really.
  sec: 2406
  time: '40:06'
  who: Nicolas
- header: The importance of knowing infrastructure tools
- line: Then the question goes on, “How important is it to know infrastructure tools?”
    By this, I think they mean tools like Kubernetes or setting up databases, or whatever
    we use for data pipelines, like Kubernetes, Terraform. Is it something you also
    look for in candidates or is this secondary?
  sec: 2510
  time: '41:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: It really depends on your organization. So here, for example, at Onfido we
    do have DevOps engineers that are specifically working on the cloud platform.
    If you join a smaller company as a data engineer – if you don't have DevOps, the
    data engineers might have a broader scope. If you're targeting midsize to large
    companies, I'm sure this is very important to know. Or at least to be aware of
    what it is and what it is used for – that's the main thing, really. Generally,
    now most of the organizations have DevOps folks who are working with this. Then
    after, it really depends on the synergy between how DevOps and data engineers
    are working together. Here, it also depends on the companies.
  sec: 2542
  time: '42:22'
  who: Nicolas
- line: It's actually not different for OLX – the company where I work. Because we
    do have DevOps (we don't call them DevOps) but there are people who will take
    care of the platform stuff, so then it's easier for us data scientists and engineers
    to just use these things.
  sec: 2619
  time: '43:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Now it’s crazy because you also have machine learning Ops, for example, who
    are like the DevOps for ML. But now, we have also seen a sort of split – because
    in some organizations, you have data engineers, but you have like BI engineers
    and analytics engineers. So it depends also on the organization, because it's
    all organization. You're just called a data engineer, but you’re doing a bit of
    all three. It also depends on the companies and how they split and organize themselves.
  sec: 2637
  time: '43:57'
  who: Nicolas
- header: Preparing for the interview
- line: Yeah. Another question, “What would you recommend that job applicants do before
    talking to a recruiter or a hiring manager?”
  sec: 2675
  time: '44:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna repeat myself again [chuckles], but yeah. Care about
    the business. As a recruiter, I would say I always plan the intro call with candidates
    – whether they applied or if I reach out to them. I never call by surprise. I've
    seen this – honestly, this is really bad – I've talked to someone who had absolutely
    no clue about what the company was doing. How to prepare? See and check on the
    business and the product. Of course, you don't have to know perfectly about the
    business or the products. But at least understand the problem that the company
    is trying to solve. After, if you have any specific questions about the product
    or the business, the recruiter will be there to give you more details and more
    insights.
  sec: 2683
  time: '44:43'
  who: Nicolas
- line: Personally, I also ask the same questions each time, such as , “How did you
    hear about the company?” So, if they heard about the company before? This is also
    useful for the data engineering process, but you have to be able to explain the
    projects you've worked on – currently, or in the past – but you have to be able
    to explain it to a non-technical person. Maybe I might be a bit more technical
    than some recruiters, but that's also something that is very important to train.
    Just train talking a bit more about yourself, like, “This is what I've done. This
    is the project I've worked on. This was the challenge.” And also say why you applied.
    Or if it was a reach out – why are we talking right now?
  sec: 2683
  time: '44:43'
  who: Nicolas
- line: If you have any specific career explorations, things that you want to learn,
    etc. This is important to share. There's really no very technical discussion with
    a recruiter. It's pretty high level, but some candidates might not be that comfortable
    talking about themselves – what they've done and what they would like to do.
  sec: 2683
  time: '44:43'
  who: Nicolas
- line: I've made this mistake of not preparing well for interviews. This strategy
    of just spraying and praying is what I did like a couple of years ago. I would
    just go to LinkedIn and other websites and just apply to everyone. Standard cover
    letter – the same CV. Then, of course, recruiters were answering me. Then I had
    a call with one of the recruiters who asked me as the first thing, “Okay, tell
    us what you know about us?” And they was like… [cross-talk]
  sec: 2863
  time: '47:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I always ask this question. [laughs] I always ask, “What do you know
    about the company? Just tell me everything that you know, and if there's something
    that is not true. Then I will complete the gap and give you more details.” Because
    also, especially as a data engineer, if you apply to a company where the business
    or the product looks particularly interesting to you – this is a huge plus. When
    you're going to start talking with a data engineer manager, for example, and you
    say, “Oh, yeah – I've used your product!” Or, “I think the product is pretty cool,”
    etc. It shows that you do care about the business. In the end, generally speaking,
    it's positive.
  sec: 2893
  time: '48:13'
  who: Nicolas
- line: It's a positive thing, definitely. The end of that story wasn't very positive
    because I asked, “Okay, can you remind me of the company’s name?” [laughs] That
    was already a bad thing. After she told me the name, I thought, “Sorry, I don't
    remember what you actually do.” Then, of course, needless to say, they didn't
    call me. They didn't write back after that interview. For me, the lesson there
    was “Okay, maybe instead of just applying to everything I see, maybe it should
    take a little bit of time to actually care and read about companies.”
  sec: 2945
  time: '49:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, and target the companies that you think are interesting, whether you
    like the business or the product, or the kind of data. Are you seeking a company
    where you have big amounts of data? Or maybe less data, but a more privacy-oriented
    company, for example. Maybe you want to deal with data from healthcare, ecommerce,
    financial, etc. So yeah, if you have any specific interest in one of the domains,
    you can also have targets there. But also, a thing that can help as well is to
    network. There are all these communities – go and listen to people that are doing
    data engineering, read articles, and then you're going to reinforce your own opinion
    on what kind of problems you find super interesting. Then you can target the right
    companies.
  sec: 2977
  time: '49:37'
  who: Nicolas
- header: The importance of a formal education
- line: What would you say about people without a formal computer science degree?
    Would you hire somebody without a formal degree, but someone that has a set of
    data engineering projects?
  sec: 3045
  time: '50:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so I'm gonna be very clear. I don't care if you have a diploma or not,
    as long as you have the skills and the experience. As long as you learned what
    you need to. I've hired some self-taught engineers. I remember, I think it was
    a couple of years ago, for a company I've hired so someone who has a generic engineering
    degree and studied as a data analyst. Then this person got interested in more
    of the data piece and kind of trained herself. So you may have a diploma or a
    formal education that is not exactly computer science – that's one of the things
    that I find really cool about computer science and tech, in general.
  sec: 3057
  time: '50:57'
  who: Nicolas
- line: Generally it’s not that focused on “Oh, this person didn't graduate from this
    or this university.” “Oh, they just have a bachelor's degree.” I mean, you're
    in high demand if you have the skills and you show to everyone that you've learned,
    and you keep learning. That's also something very important. Just keep learning.
    See, if you spot any trends, any new tools. You should be aware. Because you can
    be stuck in old technologies that you used 10 years ago – data science moves fast.
    There's always new stuff. So yeah –the degree doesn't matter, but just be aware
    of what the trends are in the market on the technology side, and follow that trend.
  sec: 3057
  time: '50:57'
  who: Nicolas
- line: For me, personally, the only institution that was interested in my degree
    was the foreign authority in Germany. To get a work permit – to get a visa – there
    are some requirements foreigners need to pass in order to get the work permit.
    And that was the only time I actually needed my degree. Nobody else cared about
    that.
  sec: 3172
  time: '52:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For me, I've never been a fan of a five years minimum experience in
    this or this technology and in this role. Because you can have a very senior person
    with three years experience. The number of years of experience doesn't matter.
    The formal education doesn't matter to me as much. The only thing I'm going to
    focus on is – skills, experience, and the projects you've been working on. If
    you had a diploma in finance back in the day, I don't read that. I just look at
    the last five years and what you've done. And if it's interesting, okay, then
    we'll talk. That's why, when you have a resume – give some details. Not too much,
    but get straight to the point.
  sec: 3199
  time: '53:19'
  who: Nicolas
- header: The importance having a project portfolio
- line: So, you mentioned projects like 10 times by now. Do you maybe remember some
    of the projects that really stood out, where you thought “Wow! Cool! This candidate
    is definitely passing my screen into the next step.”
  sec: 3265
  time: '54:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For example, if you have some kind of project – [laughs] I’m not technical
    enough to explain – but, if you say that, “I've been hired at this startup and
    I was one of the first data engineers. We started to work on building the first
    pipelines.” or, for example, “We've built certain data pipelines or data sets
    for a very specific business need,” or something like, “Oh, yeah, with GDPR, we
    had to remodel and change the system workflow,” for example. Or maybe “We are
    dealing with private data, so I had to put in place some data deletion systems.”
    This is some stuff that is pretty cool.
  sec: 3281
  time: '54:41'
  who: Nicolas
- line: So it's not about the portfolio. It's not about your public GitHub profile
    with all the projects you’ve worked on – it's more about what projects you can
    talk about to the recruiter and explain it concisely in a way that any non-technical
    person would understand what the project is about. Right? So it's more about having
    these stories prepared for the interview, rather than published to GitHub. Do
    you actually look at the GitHub profiles of candidates?
  sec: 3353
  time: '55:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say when candidates share the link – yeah, I have a quick look. I
    do believe that my colleagues on the data engineering side definitely have a look,
    when you're applying as an engineer. But similarly, there's no obligation to share
    anything – you just share what you want to share. I mean, not everyone has a passion
    for it and wants to spend all their weekends on open source or doing their own
    projects. You know, people have lives, so you also have to find the right balance.
  sec: 3382
  time: '56:22'
  who: Nicolas
- line: In the end it is the same for resumes – anything that you think is worth sharing,
    please share. That's the only thing. So if you say that, “Okay, I'm not a data
    engineer yet, but I have done this online certification, I've done this one, etc.
    I did this online degree, and I worked on this project.” So as long as you're
    able to talk about it and go into the details to someone from engineering after
    the initial interview, you should put that in your resume. But you should be able
    to talk about it in detail. Because sometimes it happens like, “Oh, yeah, I've
    worked on this project.” But when the interviewer asks for elaboration, they just
    say, “Oh, but no. In the end, there were four people doing this.” And the candidate
    just touches on the spots of the project that they worked on specifically.
  sec: 3382
  time: '56:22'
  who: Nicolas
- header: How your current domain influence the interview
- line: There is a question from Dan. The question is about switching from one industry
    to another. I’m wondering, do you actually look at the industry where the candidate
    works in? Or do you care mostly about “Okay, this person is already a data engineer
    or knows some data engineer,” and then only after that you look at the industry
    where they work?
  sec: 3485
  time: '58:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I am not specifically looking for someone who's specifically working in
    one industry or the other. Some industries can be a bit more interesting, however.
    For example, if you're working with some regulated companies, like banks or trading
    platforms, etc. Or if you're dealing with private data – so if you're working
    in health care or insurance, for example. This can be a specific set of skills,
    or domain knowledge that can be interesting. But otherwise, no – I just look for
    the projects. The industry doesn’t matter, unless it's very specific.

  sec: 3565

  who: Alexey
- line: Sorry? [cross-talk] Yeah. We didn't know and I think that this is the first
    thing that we talked to each other about when we connected before the event. [laughs]
    Yeah, definitely not on purpose.
  sec: 3571
  time: '59:31'
  who: Nicolas
- line: Okay. I don't think we have time for more questions. There are still seven
    questions. Apologies. Yeah, I think we partly covered some of them. Maybe now
    word for word, but I think maybe half. [cross-talk]
  sec: 3587
  time: '59:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: If that's any other questions left, there's my LinkedIn or Twitter – you can
    send me any questions. Another thing I would advise – I think you have Alicia
    on podcast as well – she shared a lot of very good advice about the resume and
    how to source a job, etc. So you should have a listen to the event and the webinar
    next month, if you really want to dive deeper on the technical side, or actually
    how I'm doing it in terms of skills. It should be useful. I've done a bit of a
    trailer for the webinar. [chuckles]
  sec: 3599
  time: '59:59'
  who: Nicolas
- line: '[laughs] I’m the one who should be doing this. So thanks a lot for doing
    that.'
  sec: 3659
  time: '1:00:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, because I kind of feel that there’s some in-between in terms of the
    things that I have said. So if you listen to Alicia for more on the HR side. Also,
    I don't remember the name – Jeff, I think. Yeah. So it's more concrete. So, with
    the three of us – I hope it will help you.

    Yeah, it was nice talking to you. Thanks, everyone for tuning in, for asking questions.
