description: 'Discover building a domestic risk assessment: data cleaning, risk scoring
  models, and privacy compliance to improve triage, reduce bias, and ensure compliance.'
intro: 'How do you build an accurate, privacy‑compliant domestic risk assessment tool
  that frontline teams can actually use? In this episode Sabina Firtala — who leads
  Frontline’s AI product development and brings experience in data wrangling, model
  validation, and applied analytics from finance, SaaS, and mission‑driven projects
  — walks through a practical roadmap. <br><br> We cover problem framing and project
  scope; sources like case management, public records, and surveys; and hands‑on data
  work: cleaning, linking, and feature engineering. Sabina explains risk scoring approaches
  and model architecture, evaluation metrics and bias assessment, plus privacy, ethical
  considerations, and legal data governance. You’ll also hear about deployment into
  frontline workflows, user interface and decision‑support design, training and stakeholder
  trust, ongoing monitoring and drift detection, and examples of impact on triage
  and resource allocation. The conversation closes with collaboration strategies,
  funding and scaling, open documentation for reproducibility, and concrete lessons
  learned. <br><br> Listen for actionable guidance on data cleaning, building and
  validating risk scoring models, and ensuring privacy compliance so you can design
  responsible, usable domestic risk assessment tools.'

context: 'Context: The episode follows the end-to-end effort to create a domestic
  risk assessment tool—framing the problem, assembling and preparing data, designing
  and evaluating models, addressing privacy, ethics and legal needs, integrating with
  frontline workflows and interfaces, engaging stakeholders, monitoring performance,
  and planning for scale, funding, and reproducibility.

  Core theme: Designing and operationalizing a people-centered, data-driven domestic
  risk assessment that translates technical rigor into trustworthy, ethical, legally
  compliant, and user-friendly decision support—balancing accuracy, fairness, privacy,
  and sustainability so models meaningfully improve frontline triage and resource
  allocation in the real world.'
