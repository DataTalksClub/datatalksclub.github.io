short: Data Science for Social Impact
title: Data Science for Social Impact
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about data science for social impact. We have a special
    guest today, Christine. Christine is a writer and researcher of tech and social
    issues. She is currently studying data science for public policy, and previously,
    she spent years managing social programs and exploring Data Science for Social
    Good. Welcome, Christine.

  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi. So happy to be here. Thank you.
  sec: 90
  time: '1:30'
  who: Christine
- header: Christine’s Background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of data science for social impact, let's
    start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 93
  time: '1:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, absolutely. For me, I started wanting to really figure out how to serve
    marginalized communities, so I studied political economy and sustainable development
    in my undergrad. Then for the next four years, I worked as a program manager for
    sustainability initiatives. And then after that, I sort of became fascinated with
    data, or I saw how powerful it was in those roles.
  sec: 101
  time: '1:41'
  who: Christine
- line: I made sort of a pivot into working as a data analytics person in the private
    sector for over four years. At that point, my goal was always to bring those things
    together and that's what I'm doing now in Berlin. I came here for a graduate program
    called Data Science for Public Policy.
  sec: 101
  time: '1:41'
  who: Christine
- line: What do program managers do?
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, great question. In the social impact space, you're definitely managing
    different initiatives. For example, I was a program manager at a corporation doing
    their sustainability and corporate social responsibility. So I was the… I want
    to say “king” but that's not [laughs] – the “queen” of several initiatives that
    I took ownership of. So we had sustainability reporting, things like that, that
    I manage.
  sec: 153
  time: '2:33'
  who: Christine
- line: And by “managing” it means that you make sure that things get done? Or what
    does that mean?
  sec: 190
  time: '3:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's a little bit more than project management. I think the main difference
    is that you not only become the face behind the cause – these are initiatives
    which don't have an end. There's no end. For example, sustainability reporting
    – the organization hopes to do that forever. So there are a lot of long-term stakeholder
    relationship developments and managing large data sets. But yes, ultimately, you
    need to make sure to drive the situation forward.
  sec: 196
  time: '3:16'
  who: Christine
- line: So a “program” is a general direction and then “projects” would be individual
    steps that you need to do in order to move in this direction?
  sec: 234
  time: '3:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, projects are something with a known end. Yeah.
  sec: 244
  time: '4:04'
  who: Christine
- header: Private sector vs Public sector
- line: Okay. You said you worked as a data analyst in the private sector. What is
    the “private sector”?
  sec: 247
  time: '4:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: “Private sector” is any organization which does not have social benefits.
    I think that's one way to say it. So it's just corporations – businesses. For
    example, I worked at Toyota, Wells Fargo, Blue Cross Blue Shield – which is the
    largest health insurer in the US.
  sec: 257
  time: '4:17'
  who: Christine
- line: So basically, just companies. Right?
  sec: 281
  time: '4:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yep, exactly. Private companies. Yeah.
  sec: 285
  time: '4:45'
  who: Christine
- line: So the opposite would be “public sector,” which are government institutions,
    right?
  sec: 288
  time: '4:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Yes.
  sec: 293
  time: '4:53'
  who: Christine
- line: Okay. So you were a program manager, you liked data and you decided to go
    more into data, so you became a data analyst, and then you moved to Berlin to
    study data science for public policy.
  sec: 294
  time: '4:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Genau. [chuckles]
  sec: 309
  time: '5:09'
  who: Christine
- line: '[chuckles] For those who don''t speak German, you said “Exactly.” Right?'
  sec: 310
  time: '5:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly.
  sec: 315
  time: '5:15'
  who: Christine
- line: Okay. How's your German?
  sec: 316
  time: '5:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's coming along. I'm trying.
  sec: 318
  time: '5:18'
  who: Christine
- header: Public policy
- line: Okay. [chuckles] So you're studying data science for public policy and I was
    wondering – what actually is public policy? Can you tell us what that is?
  sec: 325
  time: '5:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, absolutely. Public policy is essentially – it's describing all of the
    laws which govern people and places. It's important in relation to social issues
    because it is the way that many social issues are addressed. Many social issues,
    obviously, have taken government intervention to address. For example, public
    libraries wouldn't have happened on their own – it requires funding, support,
    and space – things like that. So policies are the way that you get things done
    at that higher level.
  sec: 335
  time: '5:35'
  who: Christine
- line: So a policy would be something like “For every 1000 people, we need to have
    at least one library.”?
  sec: 381
  time: '6:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Something like that, yes. I'm not actually aware of any library laws. [laughs]
    But that would be a good example. I can give other real examples. But yes – ensuring
    public welfare.
  sec: 390
  time: '6:30'
  who: Christine
- line: What are the examples that you have in mind?
  sec: 404
  time: '6:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, yes. Something that I worked on, specifically in the States, was environmental
    legislation regarding electronics recycling. This was something that companies
    did not want to do, companies like HP – people that basically create printers,
    or monitors, or things like that – essentially, there was no easy way to recycle
    these at the end of their life. People would throw them away and nine times out
    of ten, they would end up on a ship for a developing country where children would
    break them down and be exposed to toxic chemicals. There was just a lot that was
    problematic with that situation and the companies were not willing to create a
    new way for people to easily rid themselves of these products in a sustainable
    way.
  sec: 406
  time: '6:46'
  who: Christine
- line: I worked as a grassroots organizer with a nonprofit to canvass neighborhoods
    and gather community support to petition lawmakers to eventually pass a law which
    required companies to take back those products. They put stations in every electronics
    store where people could bring these products and there would actually be checks
    in place to make sure these products were recycled in a sustainable way.
  sec: 406
  time: '6:46'
  who: Christine
- line: The companies did not have enough motivation to do this on their own, so they
    needed an extra nudge coming from the government saying, “Hey, you actually must
    give people a way to recycle products.”
  sec: 488
  time: '8:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 500
  time: '8:20'
  who: Christine
- line: The government came up with a law and you were kind of the driving force behind
    it – you did this as a program manager, right? Or were you a data analyst?
  sec: 501
  time: '8:21'
  who: Alexey
- header: The challenges of being a community organizer
- line: '[cross-talk] This was actually before that. I did this as a community organizer.
    There''s lots of stuff in between and exploring social issues. But yes, I was
    a community organizer. I knocked on doors, actually, gathered signatures and donations,
    and then we brought everything to the Capitol. Yep.'
  sec: 507
  time: '8:27'
  who: Christine
- line: You must be quite persuasive to accomplish this, right? Or is it easy to persuade
    people that “This thing is bad. This thing is good. Give me your signature.”?
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You know, actually, I've worked for over 10 years and seriously – that
    is still the hardest job I have ever done. [chuckles] Yeah, it's not easy. You
    knock on their door, they don't know you, they’ve never seen you, they’ve never
    heard of this issue – and now you want money. [laughs] And you want them to write
    their signature or print out some letters. People are doing this – community organizers
    are doing this – everywhere. It's just the hardest work I've ever done. [sighs]
    [chuckles] Yeah.
  sec: 539
  time: '8:59'
  who: Christine
- line: But I guess they don't have to give you any money, right? All they have to
    give you is a signature.
  sec: 571
  time: '9:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Both are definitely equally as important. The letter is what gets this issue
    noticed by our representatives, but the money definitely helps facilitate all
    of that activity – like going to the Capitol, all this time.
  sec: 577
  time: '9:37'
  who: Christine
- line: So you were a volunteer but somehow you still needed to get paid. Right?
  sec: 596
  time: '9:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, no – I worked there. It was my job to do that. But yes, the organization
    as a whole needed, obviously, funds to operate. So we would knock on doors for
    eight hours.
  sec: 601
  time: '10:01'
  who: Christine
- header: How public policy relates to political science
- line: Regarding public policy – I thought policy is maybe related to politics, or
    political science. But it's not, right? Or is it?
  sec: 614
  time: '10:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is, yes. I would say political science is just the study of the systems
    of governance and public policy is essentially putting it into action, I guess.
    I think one is an application, I guess, more so. Maybe that's a good way to say
    it.
  sec: 625
  time: '10:25'
  who: Christine
- line: I think you've partly answered that previously. I basically wanted to know
    how public policies are related to social impact and I think the example you gave
    is pretty good. I was able to understand it – companies need to recycle the products
    they do not want, so how can we encourage them or force them to do this?
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: The social impact is that the environment perhaps doesn't get harmed as a
    result – you don't have these chemicals that you mentioned and children do not
    play with printers. Is this how it's related? You come up with policies to have
    a social impact. Correct?
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely, yes. I think social issues tend to just be really, really complex.
    Usually, there's just multiple ways to address it. I'd say for example, in that
    situation, the bigger picture is like, “How do we increase sustainability? How
    do we increase well-being?” And this is just one little part of that. So yeah,
    exactly what you said. Yeah.
  sec: 701
  time: '11:41'
  who: Christine
- header: Programs that teach data science for public policy
- line: Coming back to “data science for public policy,” to prepare for this interview
    – I googled it. I found the program where you study and I found a couple of other
    programs. I think there was one in the States – in Washington University, I think,
    or it was from Washington, DC – and I saw a couple of other places. Then I also
    came across a book that has exactly this name “Data Science for Public Policy.”
    But, in general, is it mature as a discipline? Are there other textbooks apart
    from this book? Are there people who are seriously working on this? How can you
    (I want to save “marry”), but like how you can do data science for public policy?
  sec: 730
  time: '12:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. My sense is that it's very new. I started following this concept of
    ‘Data Science for Social Good’ maybe five or six years ago. At that time, (obviously,
    I was in the States) there was really only one program that I was aware of in
    the country – it was at the University of Chicago. They had a fellowship, actually
    – it wasn't an academic program – where they would help technical or policy people
    to bring these concepts together.
  sec: 776
  time: '12:56'
  who: Christine
- line: Actually, the reason I ended up in Germany is because, upon doing research
    – I had done research for years looking to answer “How can I combine what I want
    to work on?” And this was the first data science for public policy program I found.
    Now, yes, like you said, that there are so many that it feels like they're everywhere
    now. [chuckles]
  sec: 776
  time: '12:56'
  who: Christine
- line: Well, not so many. If you just look for university programs in data science,
    you will find millions of them. But specifically for public policy – maybe for
    social good and so on, there are more – but for this specific thing, public policy,
    there are not so many yet.
  sec: 827
  time: '13:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right, sure. Yeah. [cross-talk]
  sec: 846
  time: '14:06'
  who: Christine
- line: At least I wasn’t able to find many. [chuckles]
  sec: 847
  time: '14:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, you're exactly right. It's probably still like, less than 10. But that
    feels like a huge amount [laughs] when for years, there was nothing.
  sec: 851
  time: '14:11'
  who: Christine
- header: Data science for public policy vs regular data science
- line: I do data science at work and I'm usually dealing with things like… I work
    at an internet company, so we look at clicks and transactions and things like
    this. So we, as data scientists, deal with things like linear regression, logistic
    regression, classification regression, and so on. So I was really curious, what
    are the use cases for public policy?
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I checked out this book that I was talking about, Data Science for Public
    Policy, and in the table of contents I saw that there are chapters on transforming
    data, record linkage, exploratory data analysis, cluster analysis, NLP – to me
    it looks like “Okay, this is what I already do.” Does this mean I already know
    everything I need for public policy or are there some nuances?
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, there are definitely nuances. Yes, I investigated this book as well.
    I know it's fairly new. I don't know that I would consider it “the Bible” or the
    definer of the field at all. Just like you said, I do see that the majority of
    the book is just data science, so I think that that's something that's really
    targeted towards policymakers or political scientists that want to explore this
    field. But I actually think the goal of data science for public policy is more
    so data science for social impact.
  sec: 919
  time: '15:19'
  who: Christine
- line: In the field, I guess why you specify “public policy” is that I think there
    are not only a lot of tech issues – ethical and challenging issues with technology
    – that we are facing right now. We need people who are actually educated in what
    data science is, I think that's really critical. But also I think we're getting
    to a point where every type of organization, including social impact organizations,
    will need a data scientist to support them or help them make progress.
  sec: 919
  time: '15:19'
  who: Christine
- line: I think that's the future as well – having data scientists that have some
    knowledge of the landscape or the processes is very beneficial. From my experience
    being in both spaces, they are completely different. Working for a company, working
    in social impact, government, academia, everything – it's so different.
  sec: 919
  time: '15:19'
  who: Christine
- line: So it's aimed at people who are similar to how you were a couple of years
    ago before getting into the data world? It's aimed at educating them on what data
    science is, how it can be used, and how it can bring social impact, right?
  sec: 1016
  time: '16:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, our program has quite a few folks that have a background in technology
    and there are lots of folks that are social scientists and myself – I'm like a
    mix of both. So I do think there's space for everyone that wants to have a very
    specific impact. I appreciate the specificity because social impact has so many
    layers. The school I go to, Hertie, is actually a school of governance, so all
    they teach is policy. They're experts at that part. I tend to think that that
    method is one of the most important methods to accelerating change. I do think
    people can come from different ends into this space and they just need a little
    bit of knowledge from both sides.
  sec: 1032
  time: '17:12'
  who: Christine
- line: I can give a few examples of how this has worked. So for example, I am an
    organizer with Data Science for Social Good in Berlin, which is a great organization
    if folks want to learn more about this. We had a presenter come to our most recent
    meetup and they are supporting refugees that are making their way to the southern
    coast of Europe by flying drones, and then using that footage to identify boats
    in the water, which they can send aid to. This is actually a really challenging
    issue. They use computer vision to identify the boats. They shared some photos
    like, “Can you find the boats?” And I'm like, “No. No human could find these books.”
    [chuckles] So that's just a really critical way that this organization can support
    people that would otherwise receive no support.
  sec: 1032
  time: '17:12'
  who: Christine
- line: I know in Scandinavia, they're using satellite imagery to identify all the
    flat roofs so that they can assess opportunities for rooftop gardens or things
    like that, to increase sustainability and livability in cities. I think if you
    have a specific social cause that really speaks to you or resonates with you,
    there is probably a way that you can apply technology to scale up the support
    for this issue. There's lots of examples but yeah – it can be policy-related.
  sec: 1032
  time: '17:12'
  who: Christine
- line: So usually there is some social problem and then organizations like Data Science
    for Social Good and others have a list of problems that they think should be addressed,
    right? Then they get people who know data science, who know public policy, who
    know all these things you mentioned – they try to put them together into one place
    to solve the problem, right? This university that you mentioned, it kind of teaches
    how to oversee this process, or how to run this process, right?
  sec: 1191
  time: '19:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: At this point, they are more focused on teaching the subjects separately,
    but there's so much to learn about the policy process – economics, policy analysis.
    Having just finished my first year, I feel like there's so much more to know.
    [chuckles] But yes, I think Data Science for Social Good Berlin does have nonprofit
    partners with data issues that volunteers then help them support, specifically.
  sec: 1228
  time: '20:28'
  who: Christine
- header: The importance of ethical data science in public policy
- line: Coming back to the book – one of the chapters was not the usual regression
    or usual entity linking, but rather one of the chapters was about ethics. How
    important is the problem of ethical data science to public policy?
  sec: 1266
  time: '21:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, I think it's absolutely critical. It's generally critical for all data
    science [laughs] you always hope you're doing ethical data science. But I think
    the way that it relates differently for data science for social impact or public
    policy is that, ultimately, we hope that laws reflect our values and they reflect
    the society that we want to have.
  sec: 1287
  time: '21:27'
  who: Christine
- line: There are many things that are not illegal, but are unethical. So there's
    a gap where we, as policymakers, ideally step in and try to close. Yes, I'd say
    it's absolutely critical in helping these social impact causes and organizations
    to build a strong foundation in data science. But I also just think that we will
    have some challenges in the near future regarding new technologies and innovation.
    Folks need to understand ethics to deal with them, for sure.
  sec: 1287
  time: '21:27'
  who: Christine
- line: In your printer example – throwing away a printer would not be a crime, right?
    But still, it's not ethical because it can contaminate the environment. Bad things
    can happen, but nobody will put you in jail for that.
  sec: 1355
  time: '22:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Yes. If you know that a four year-old is going to be exposed to toxic
    chemicals when you throw it away, then you throw it away in a way that doesn’t
    result in that.
  sec: 1372
  time: '22:52'
  who: Christine
- line: Do you maybe have some examples where data science was applied to do these
    things, but not ethically?
  sec: 1386
  time: '23:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a good question. Let me think on that. Maybe I will remember something
    later.
  sec: 1400
  time: '23:20'
  who: Christine
- line: I guess people who work in these areas maybe think about these issues of ethics
    more than, let's say, the average data scientist. Maybe these topics of abusing
    something just to get the model right – these things do not come up.
  sec: 1406
  time: '23:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, sure. Yeah. Actually, now that I think about it, I can think of a few
    examples. One thing that I think we'll probably come to later is new legislation
    in the EU about AI – the EU AI Act. One of the things that it deals with – its
    core method is essentially to assign risk levels to different technologies. The
    highest risk level explicitly references this social scoring system in China.
    This system essentially, through all of your goings and operations in society,
    each thing will give you a score, which will give you more access in society.
  sec: 1429
  time: '23:49'
  who: Christine
- line: For example, if you get a car loan and you pay it on time or you pay it early,
    you might be able to get a visa faster. I think the consequences of that are actually
    big. Imagine you have one situation and your score is damaged and then your whole
    family is just… you're second class citizens now. I think that's kind of an abuse
    of big data and all of these technologies and things like that.
  sec: 1429
  time: '23:49'
  who: Christine
- line: You've given an example from China, but I was thinking, “Wait a minute, isn't
    there a similar thing in Germany called Trufa?” You can easily damage this and
    then nobody will give you credit. Maybe it's not as abroad as the system you just
    described.
  sec: 1515
  time: '25:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can understand that the intention is maybe to make people behave well, right?
    Pay their debts, not litter, or whatever – but then the consequences could be
    pretty wide.
  sec: 1515
  time: '25:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. And I think the opportunity for abuse is obviously huge. Maybe you
    offend one of the maintainers of this database, then they just give you a zero
    score and then you can't access anything in the social sphere.
  sec: 1559
  time: '25:59'
  who: Christine
- header: How data science in social impact project differs from other projects
- line: What is unique when it comes to applications of data science to social impact
    projects?
  sec: 1581
  time: '26:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think the main difference that I see from being in the social impact space,
    and also working with organizations like Data Science for Social Good and similar
    organizations in the States, is that I think a technical person has to sort of
    expand their thinking. The social issue ultimately will not be solved by this
    one data science project. Often the technical solution has to consider the longevity
    or the bigger picture of this social issue to really make it effective.
  sec: 1589
  time: '26:29'
  who: Christine
- line: Also talking to a lot of non technical stakeholders – people that, honestly,
    want nothing to do with tech and will not understand what you're doing – you need
    to really understand not only how these organizations work, you need to interpret
    all these different things about the specific social issue. What I observe is
    a lot of technologists saying, “Oh. Well, here's a project idea, but will that
    solve the whole thing?” And it's like, “Nothing on Earth will solve this one problem?”
    [chuckles]This is just one small part – we have one small goal and we need to
    make sure that it lends itself to further iteration.

  who: Christine
- line: Who are the usual people/stakeholders that data scientists working in this
    domain talk to? Are they policymakers? Who are they?
  sec: 1686
  time: '28:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think nine times out of ten, they’re people very close to the social issue.
    For example, Data Science for Social Good (I'll just say DSSG) had a hackathon
    in December of last year – that's something that they do. They had a bunch of
    NGO stakeholders give datasets that have a very specific problem. For example,
    the German Red Cross was one of the stakeholders and they were addressing a hiring
    issue within their organization. Their stakeholder was a hiring manager (an HR
    manager). So that person is very close to all of the challenges, and you need
    to sort of “mine” them for information to create a dynamic solution.
  sec: 1700
  time: '28:20'
  who: Christine
- line: Mine for information? [chuckles] How do you do that? I guess you ask them
    questions, fill out some questionnaires, right? Is this how you do this? Or do
    you just sit and talk with them?
  sec: 1757
  time: '29:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it takes a lot of proactive effort on your end and then, of course,
    you ask them questions. In this situation, for example, it would have been great
    if the data analysts did their exploratory data analysis and did research on the
    structure and history of the Red Cross so that they could be prepared for what
    the stakeholder will share.
  sec: 1776
  time: '29:36'
  who: Christine
- line: A stakeholder generally has very specific challenges that they face, but they
    don't have a sense of how it can be solved with technology. So they really can't
    help you with the technical aspect. You really have to go to them with “What does
    the technical system look like in their organization? Who manages it?” And things
    like that.
  sec: 1776
  time: '29:36'
  who: Christine
- line: And how technically advanced is this part? Is it just an Excel spreadsheet?
    Or is there an actual database? Or is there a website? Or is it something like
    old-school books where you take notes? Or all of the above?
  sec: 1832
  time: '30:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, all of the above. I feel like I've seen everything. I guess that's the
    one of the big challenges that these organizations face – they're donor funded.
    They live on donations. A lot of times, you need to understand that some staff
    members are funded for a temporary amount of time, and that later, that person
    might not be there. So maybe you shouldn't build your technical plan around that
    one stakeholder. But yeah, I've seen it all. Unfortunately, I personally have
    never seen a technically savvy organization – it's always a mess. [laughs] That's
    my experience. Really bad
  sec: 1846
  time: '30:46'
  who: Christine
- line: If you're not an IT company – you have an organization but you realize that
    you need some sort of IT system quite late in the life of the organization, right?
    You just try to put it somewhere, but it doesn't really fit.
  sec: 1897
  time: '31:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Yeah.
  sec: 1916
  time: '31:56'
  who: Christine
- line: That's the one of the challenges, I guess, that data scientists need to solve,
    “Okay, now you have a model that detects boats in the ocean for helping refugees.
    But so what? How do you use this now? How do you actually help these people who
    you can detect from the drones?” Right?
  sec: 1917
  time: '31:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right, absolutely. I think that digital and data literacy is really a challenge
    everywhere. Every type of organization that is not a tech company struggles with
    some level of digital or data literacy. But I think the challenge of a lot of
    social impact organizations is that they don't have the resources to do this type
    of investment into increasing that digital or data literacy. Due to funding, they're
    so focused on the cause, even if that hinders their efficiency or personal progress.

- line: There is a question, “Which book are you referring to?” We were talking about
    a book called Data Science for Public Policy. I think it is just one book of that
    name from Springer. I don't think there are multiple books with this title. I
    think it's just the one.
  sec: 1976
  time: '32:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: By the way, I think one of the comments you made when we were discussing a
    question was that there is another book – another source – where people can learn
    these things. Which one is that?
  sec: 1976
  time: '32:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, sure. Yes. I have a bunch of resources. I think if people want to explore
    this space – that will be great. But essentially, the source that I recommend
    for people that want to explore specific applications is actually the Data Science
    for Social Good Fellowship, originally hosted by the University of Chicago. They
    have an entire page of specific projects. So it’s DSSGfellowship.org/projects.
    I will put the link in the comments.

  sec: 2034
  time: '33:54'
  who: Christine
- line: So it’s a list of projects and what we can do with this list of projects is
    go there, check out what these projects are about, and see what kind of data was
    used there – what kind of outcome was achieved. Right?
  sec: 2038
  time: '33:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Yes, most of them have videos where people involved in the project
    talk about the challenges they face, what they did, and there's all types of tech
    used – computer vision, predicting text analysis, etc.. There's a great diversity.
  sec: 2052

- header: Challenges with getting data in data science for public policy
- line: One of the things that I asked you about a couple of questions ago was what's
    unique about using data science for social impact. We talked a bit about this
    and I was wondering – how difficult is it to get data? For example, in this case
    where there are drones flying over the sea, I guess it's not that straightforward
    to get data and then actually label it. You said that for you, as a human, it
    was difficult to understand which thing is the boat and where it is, right?
  sec: 2072
  time: '34:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Yes. This organization – I don't want to say their name wrong, so I'll
    share it in the chat – but they were creating their own drones, actually, because
    they had to be sort of special or fit their budget or things like that. They had
    to try multiple different things – they had to iterate their data pipeline and
    process to sort that out. I think the challenge in a lot of social impact spaces
    is that it's a challenge not only to gather data, but it's also really challenging
    to find clean data, especially coming from the outside. There are just a lot of
    gaps, I guess. So it is a challenge to get data, even if you're the one gathering
    it.
  sec: 2103
  time: '35:03'
  who: Christine
- line: I guess in a typical IT company, you join a company as a data scientist and
    there is a database – you just do select and you join a couple of tables. Then
    maybe one of a few features is missing, maybe the data is not the cleanest data
    on Earth, but overall, you can do something. But here, in this case, you come
    and there is nothing. There is a problem that needs to be solved. There is no
    data. There is no IT infrastructure – just a bunch of people who want to solve
    this problem. Is that right?
  sec: 2162
  time: '36:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right, exactly. Imagine a data scientist building their own drone. [laughs]
    That's amazing. You have to build your own drone to gather data. [chuckles] Yeah.
  sec: 2196
  time: '36:36'
  who: Christine
- header: The problems with accessing public datasets about recycling
- line: Yeah. So a question from Matt, “Are there models – guidelines, websites, templates
    – for recycling projects that would facilitate their implementation by a small
    group in the regional community?”
  sec: 2209
  time: '36:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hmm… Recycling in a regional community – am I hearing that right? Man, I think
    there are a few challenges there that have nothing to do with the data science.
    And I think there's probably a couple of ways that you can approach that. So I
    need a little bit more information – I'm sorry to give such an unsatisfying response.
    But Matt, if you do want to reach out to me, please do, and I’ll be happy to chat.
  sec: 2225
  time: '37:05'
  who: Christine
- line: But in general, is there any public information on recycling projects – like
    the one you mentioned about printers – for people to read and get inspiration
    about them? Is there public data about this?
  sec: 2261
  time: '37:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know that I'm aware of a public dataset about any type of recycling
    program. I don't know that they keep track of how much they gather, how many people
    are involved – these numbers might be buried somewhere in a public budget, but
    they will not… you only receive like one number, “We deployed 5000 cans,” and
    you don't know to where necessarily.
  sec: 2273
  time: '37:53'
  who: Christine
- line: I guess the companies, the industry, who produce this electronic equipment
    are not super incentivized to make all this data publicly available. Because,
    first, it’s bad for their image and they will have to do something about this.
  sec: 2309
  time: '38:29'

    one of my main goals in being in this process. I''m currently in a fellowship
    working on a few different areas to see where I think I can be the most effective.
    The issues that, not only do I care about, but I think are the most critical issues
    of our time, are: climate justice, women''s issues (like gender equality) or just
    women''s issues as a whole, and then ethical or responsible technology. I think
    there''s a lot of ways to address all those things. Obviously, they''re huge issues.
    But it would be my hope to find some data science applications to one of those
    areas, for sure.'
  sec: 2367

  who: Christine
- header: Gender inequality in STEM fields
- line: Speaking of gender inequality, just yesterday, we had another conversation
    where one of the points was that, just in general, females are not encouraged
    to go into STEM fields – to go into science. Some don't like these areas, but
    in general, society doesn't encourage them to follow this direction. Is there
    something we can do as data scientists, let's say, who work for public policy?
    Is there any policy that can help with this issue?
  sec: 2419
  time: '40:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, yes. I think there's a lot. I actually saw you yesterday with Olga –
    she was really grilling you too. I was like, “What's happening? Tables are turned.”
    [laughs]
  sec: 2453

  sec: 2463
  time: '41:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [chuckles] Good. That’s good. What I have observed and my understanding,
    is that a lot of times women are not only not encouraged, but they are actively
    prevented from joining this field. At one of my jobs, I have a manager who is
    a woman and she wanted to go into STEM, but was actually not allowed to.
  sec: 2464
  time: '41:04'
  who: Christine
- line: I think on many levels this needs to change, but I do think there are ways
    that we can encourage more transparency. Because I do think a lot of this discrimination
    or subtle discouragement is really nuanced. It's hard to say, “Make that illegal.
    Don't discourage.” You can't throw someone in prison for that. [chuckles]
  sec: 2464
  time: '41:04'
  who: Christine
- line: That's what I thought as well. It probably happens from the familial level,
    right? Maybe the dad says, “Hey, don't do this. Go study law,” or something like
    that.”
  sec: 2518
  time: '41:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. “Marry a lawyer. Don't study law – marry a lawyer.” [chuckles] Absolutely.
    I think these social issues are  so ingrained. I mean, we really have to all,
    individually, do the work to study the lessons our society has taught us. But
    I do think increasing transparency in this space is one way to sort of change
    the conversation.
  sec: 2529
  time: '42:09'
  who: Christine
- line: For example, in the EU we have this corporate social responsibility legislation,
    and one of the things that's not required but is a value in that space, is salary
    transparency. I think by requiring organizations to record this information –
    report the makeup of their companies – this is one way for people to see really
    clearly what's happening and keep companies accountable. I think there could be
    more education about creating safer organizations.
  sec: 2529
  time: '42:09'
  who: Christine
- line: I know y'all talked about writing job descriptions that are sort of gender-neutral
    and there's some material out there for that. But yeah, these are some ways I
    think policy could come in or community efforts could come in, and try to address
    that issue.
  sec: 2529
  time: '42:09'
  who: Christine
- line: Is it something that you can potentially work on as a part of your graduation
    project? Or as a part of what you do after the Master’s?
  sec: 2610
  time: '43:30'
  who: Alexey
- header: Corporate responsibility and why organizations need social impact data scientists
- line: The rest of my life after Master’s? [laughs] Yeah, we will have a thesis,
    sure – like any other graduate Master's program. But I definitely hope to. I think
    that corporate social responsibility really will be critical to addressing all
    those issues. Corporations have such a huge impact now – they have such a huge
    reach – we really need to require them to be responsible citizens of our world.
    Legislation will help with that, for sure.
  sec: 2618
  time: '43:38'
  who: Christine
- line: I imagine that in a project like that, the modeling part will not be the most
    difficult one. Maybe it will be just fitting a linear regression, but the most
    difficult part would be actually getting the data, analyzing the data, preparing
    the data, and then conveying the results in a way where the problem is clear,
    right?
  sec: 2653
  time: '44:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, yes. Because of this corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative
    in the EU – the amount of data in that space is actually growing really rapidly,
    so I think there will be potential for more sophisticated applications in the
    future. But you're right. I think right now, it's somewhat more of a policy issue
    for sure – a social issue. Yeah.
  sec: 2672
  time: '44:32'
  who: Christine
- line: What kinds of organizations need data scientists that specialize in things
    like social impact and public policy? Is it governments? Is it universities? Is
    it somebody else?
  sec: 2697
  time: '44:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I will be the annoying person that says “every organization” [laugh]
    in the future. And I say this because not only does every nonprofit hopefully
    have a data person, I honestly think that the whole data space is kind of evolving
    towards more of a data persona person. So I think, obviously, all of those organizations
    will hopefully have support in analyzing what they have so that they can more
    efficiently make decisions.
  sec: 2709
  time: '45:09'
  who: Christine
- line: But every corporation has a public policy department as well. Those people
    also need to understand the technology and the way that their business relates
    to technology. All the time, I see things like “public policy at Amazon” “public
    policy at Airbnb”. And these are tech companies, they need to understand what’s
    happening – the gaps in the AI Act and things like that. So I think in the future,
    that type of person will be very valuable.
  sec: 2709
  time: '45:09'
  who: Christine
- line: But right now, I know that in the States, there is a position called US Chief
    Data Scientist. What's the name of that person? DJ Patil. I think DJ was the first
    Chief Data Scientist. I'm wondering, what kind of problems does this role actually
    solve? All these problems that we talked about here in this podcast?
  sec: 2785
  time: '46:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. You know, I'm actually not too familiar with his tenure in the Obama
    administration. I did follow him quite a bit afterwards. He's very dynamic and
    is a really huge advocate of the humanities, education, things like that – diverse
    education for backgrounds of data scientists.
  sec: 2812
  time: '46:52'
  who: Christine
- line: I’ll need to investigate, because I think at that point, the US does lack
    a lot of complete open data as well. So I think it's like data science but maybe
    just data at first – I don't know.
  sec: 2812
  time: '46:52'
  who: Christine
- line: I guess the idea is like, “We already have so many data sets, now let's have
    somebody who can make use of this data.”
  sec: 2849
  time: '47:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. I think it was a savvy choice for Obama to at least send the message
    that “We want to be a country that values innovation and technology, and is proactive
    about accommodating this,” because I think at that time data science was like
    the buzzword. It was very foggy as to what data science actually was. So I think
    at that point, it was more like… I don't know what.

- line: Let's say somebody is interested in learning about this and working with data
    science, making a social impact, and making a difference with their data skills.
    What do they need to get started?
  sec: 2899
  time: '48:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I would just congratulate that person and really just encourage them
    to keep pursuing that. But I think I would recommend two things. Not only is Data
    Science for Social Good an excellent organization, but this is a global organization
    as well. So if you're not able to join – if you don't have a local Data Science
    for Social Good group, there are ones where you can volunteer remotely. If you
    feel ready to dive right in, this is a great way for you to learn from folks that
    have been doing this, get exposure to social issues and things like that.
  sec: 2917
  time: '48:37'
  who: Christine
- line: I think the second thing is I would really encourage you to see if you have
    a particular issue that resonates with you, and really start your research and
    understanding the current landscape of that issue. For example, I think we have
    the Sustainable Development Goals, created by the UN and that lists out very clear,
    specific social issues and goals. I think if you read through those, find something
    that resonates with you, and do a little research, for a lot of those (because
    they were presented a while ago) there's beginning to be more data for each of
    those specific social issues. So you could get far on your own if you do have
    a cause in mind.
  sec: 2917
  time: '48:37'
  who: Christine
- line: Is there a list somewhere? Because I know that there is Data Science for Social
    Good Berlin. I guess there is Data Science for Social Good Germany, then there
    is one in Portugal, there is one in Poland. We have quite a few organizations.
    Then there is Omdena, I think they're also doing things like that. Do you know
    of Omdena?
  sec: 3004

  sec: 3024
  time: '50:24'
  who: Christine
- line: I think they are also doing some projects and then they get data scientists
    who want to get experience so they can coach them and let them work on their data
    skills. So there are quite a few of them. It's quite… I want to say decentralized,
    for lack of a better word.
  sec: 3027
  time: '50:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: What I'm trying to ask is – is there maybe a place where all these problems
    are listed and then instead of your geographical area – where you go to Data Science
    for Social Good Berlin, for example – instead of that, you can see a list and
    think, “Okay, this problem really resonates with me, I want to work on that one.”?
  sec: 3027

  sec: 3066
  time: '51:06'
  who: Christine
- header: 80,000 hours
- line: Yeah, for example, or a list of issues that might need some help – sort of
    like a job posting or job board with these kinds of problems where help is needed.
  sec: 3070
  time: '51:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: You know, there actually is. This was another resource I wanted to share with
    the folks watching. There's an excellent organization – I think they're called
    80,000 hours –essentially, their mission is to help people effectively create
    impact. They do have a job board, and they do rank jobs based on how critical
    that issue is to saving the world, basically. [chuckles] Like, “What's the greatest
    risk to humanity?” They will rank all the issues and organizations affiliated
    with those issues, in that order. So I will also put a link to that organization
    in the comments.
  sec: 3083
  time: '51:23'
  who: Christine

    organization and they have their own Wikipedia page, which says that they’re previous
    serious.

  sec: 3142
  time: '52:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: 80,000 hours? Yes. I think this is how long the average person spends in their
    career. That's quite a long time if you think about it, and you can make a meaningful
    difference with that time, instead of just… yeah.
  sec: 3146
  time: '52:26'

    an impact instead of bringing revenue to yet another… corporation.

    they’re quite a savvy organization – they''re quite educational. I think there
    are many ways for people to make their career have a huge impact. An example I
    know they give is like this Google engineer who loves his job at Google – and
    he makes a pledge to donate like 20% of his income for the rest of his life, for
    the rest of his 80,000 hours. And there''s other things – they provide many different
    options and they give quite a lot of education as to why this is impactful, or

    your classmates. What kind of problems do you see that they’re solving, or you
    see in general that are being solved now with data science?

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so I think in my program right now, we're diving more into the deep
    end in both of these topics, and have not yet had much of an opportunity to bring
    them together. I know we had some group projects, for example, that addressed
    a lack of census data. I worked with a group, where we used satellite imagery
    to try to predict poverty levels.
  sec: 3256
  time: '54:16'
  who: Christine
- line: It’s an incomplete project, but essentially, there are some countries that
    don't have this census – Afghanistan is one of them – so it would be really helpful
    to have estimations of what poverty looks like in these countries so that aid
    or support can be accurately given. Of course, we use computer vision for analyzing
    the satellite images. It’s an incomplete project but I guess it’s one way that
    you can sort of combine those issues.
  sec: 3256
  time: '54:16'
  who: Christine
- line: Interesting. I guess as a part of a census – I don't remember the last time
    somebody actually asked me this question. I think it was like 15 years ago. I
    don't remember what was on there. They asked me my nationality, what I do, and
    I think that was pretty much it. So I don't know. Even though I was a part of
    the census, I don't know how much useful information they actually learned about
    me, apart from my nationality.

- line: Hmm. Interesting. Okay. Yeah.

- header: Coffee, Ethics & AI
- line: Um. Nothing comes to mind right now, but I do actually want to pitch one thing
    if you want to explore the space. I moderate an open coffee club that focuses
    on ethics in AI. The goal is to democratize this conversation. Every meeting,
    every other week, we have different ethical challenges in the space. It's just
    a one hour casual coffee chat – start your day with an existential crisis [laughs]
    (I’m kidding) a challenge for the human race.
  sec: 3382
  time: '56:22'
  who: Christine
- line: So what was the last challenge at your last meeting?
  sec: 3423
  time: '57:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we actually met yesterday morning and we talked about LaMDA, the Google
    chat bot, which people are debating whether it's sentient or not and maybe the
    potential consequences of the response, or just the situation. It was an interesting
    conversation.
  sec: 3429
  time: '57:09'
  who: Christine
- line: I’ve never heard about LaMDA. I heard about a bot from Microsoft that became
    racist pretty quickly. Like because it was trained on data from Twitter, so people
    on Twitter would teach the bot and then, of course, this would happen – if you
    just let people do this without controlling it. I should look LaMda up. Okay.
    If somebody wants to reach out to you, what's the best way to do this?

- header: Finding Christine online
- line: Sure. I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn. I do have a website with an email newsletter
    that you can try to contact or sign up. But yes, I think these are the main ways
    – Twitter, LinkedIn, and ChristineCepelak.com
  sec: 3486
  time: '58:06'
  who: Christine
- line: So that's first name, last name.com and then you have a newsletter there.
    Okay, we will make sure to include all these links in the description under the
    video. I guess that's it for today. Thanks a lot for joining us today. Thanks
    a lot for sharing your experience, the stories with us – all these problems.
