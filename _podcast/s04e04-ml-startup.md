transcript:
- line: Today we'll talk about building machine learning startups. We have a special
    guest today, Elena. Elena is the CEO and co-founder of Evidently AI, which is
    a startup that develops open source tools for machine learning model monitoring.
    She has been in the machine learning space since 2014. Evidently is not her first
    startup. Before Evidently, Elena co-founded an industrial AI startup, so Elena
    has a lot of experience with startups.

  who: Alexey
- line: "It's not the first time we speak with Elena, actually. Elena is a returning\
    \ star. In February, she gave a presentation about \u201CHow your machine learning\
    \ project will fail\u201D which is a great talk and I recommend it to everyone.\
    \ Check it out \u2013 it's on our YouTube channel. Before this week, it was the\
    \ most popular talk on our channel. Now it's second because of Santiago\u2019\
    s talk on Monday. But this is a great talk nonetheless, and I do recommend checking\
    \ it out. Thanks for joining us for the second time."
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks. I'm super glad to join.
  sec: 199
  time: '3:19'
  who: Elena
- header: "Elena\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go into our main topic of building machine learning startups, let's
    talk a bit about your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 202
  time: '3:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: In short, it has been either about startups, machine learning, or both, pretty
    much for the last nine years. Originally, I started in the startup scene in Berlin
    when I joined a startup that was doing some ecommerce search aggregation. This
    is how I was first introduced to both topics, because they also were using some
    machine learning. It was pretty basic things back then, but still. Then I joined
    Yandex, which is the largest search engine in Russia and I was running a startup
    accelerator there. That is one of the things that I'm still super proud of, because
    it was a very rewarding experience to help other people launch their companies.
    You meet so many people who are active and doing things. It's actually very, very
    inspiring.
  sec: 213
  time: '3:33'
  who: Elena
- line: So I got inspired too and I joined an internal startup with Yandex, which
    was called Yandex Data Factory. The idea was, since Yandex did so much machine
    learning internally, we could apply it elsewhere. So we were working with different
    industries, and I was doing business development mainly.
  who: Elena
- line: "Then I left to co-found the startup where we worked with manufacturing. Companies\
    \ like steelmaking, aluminum production, oil and gas \u2013 we helped them apply\
    \ machine learning. I was holding a product role, basically as a founder that\
    \ does many other things, because that's what you do when you do a startup. Right\
    \ now we're building a new startup that works with open source model monitoring.\
    \ You can check it out and try it, it's completely free and open source, which\
    \ is probably another topic that we will discuss \u2013 why we applied this strategy\
    \ to it."
  who: Elena
- line: "That said, I want to give a bit of a disclaimer \u2013 if you try to start\
    \ a startup, you'll get a lot of advice, whether it\u2019s solicited or not, so\
    \ please take everything I say with a grain of salt. No one is an expert in your\
    \ business, but you can still learn from someone else\u2019s mistakes and thoughts.\
    \ So just adjust to the experience when you listen to someone."
  who: Elena
- line: So including this podcast?
  sec: 309
  time: '5:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Including this podcast. Don't take it at face value.
  sec: 310
  time: '5:10'
  who: Elena
- header: Why do a startup instead of being an employee?
- line: Do you know why people start their own business? What motivates them? Why
    not just work for a company?
  sec: 318
  time: '5:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Well, I think it really depends \u2013 in different countries, there are\
    \ different circumstances. It's also important to distinguish between starting\
    \ a traditional business and building a startup. For example, you can open a restaurant\
    \ or teach a course \u2013 something that has a known business model. Or you can\
    \ go into startups, where you launch some tech company and try to solve something\
    \ really new \u2013 it's a very different approach to business. When I talk about\
    \ traditional business \u2013 for example, for immigrants, it could be like a\
    \ survival strategy. You come to the country and start a business because it\u2019s\
    \ the only way for you to build up wealth. Some people want to get rich \u2013\
    \ I would actually advise against that. If you want to get rich, there may be\
    \ other schemes than building a startup."
  sec: 328
  time: '5:28'
  who: Elena
- line: "Some people want to genuinely solve a problem that they see. Some people\
    \ just enjoy creating things from scratch \u2013 that's probably more about me,\
    \ because I'm a type of person who likes to start up things from the very beginning.\
    \ It can be inside a company or it can be elsewhere, but it's all about doing\
    \ something from scratch."
  who: Elena
- line: So getting rich is not what startups are about?
  sec: 382
  time: '6:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, you can succeed, but the chances are pretty low. There are more guaranteed
    paths to do that, I would say. Working for big tech is probably much more lucrative.
  sec: 385
  time: '6:25'
  who: Elena
- line: "I think I read an article somewhere where it said \u201CIf you take the expected\
    \ value \u2013 how much on average you would earn working in a big tech company\
    \ versus creating a startup \u2013 startups would give you smaller expected returns.\u201D"
  sec: 392
  time: '6:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: But many people enjoy the journey.
  sec: 414
  time: '6:54'
  who: Elena
- line: Yeah. I can imagine that when you make a startup, like you said in your previous
    startup and I guess in your current one, you took a product role. This meant you
    ended up doing many, many different things.
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's not just the product part, but basically everything that you need to
    get yourself to the next level, right? In different stages in the company that
    might mean different things.
  sec: 432
  time: '7:12'
  who: Elena
- header: Where to get ideas for your startup
- line: Let's say I am motivated to start a startup. I know some machine learning,
    so I want to build a machine learning startup. Where can I get ideas for that?
  sec: 443
  time: '7:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Well, first of all \u2013 don't. Don't start a machine learning startup.\
    \ What I mean by that is \u2013 when you frame it like this, you actually decide\
    \ on a solution before the problem. You already know the technology that you're\
    \ going to use instead of looking for the best way to solve a problem. Here's\
    \ a trick. You might know some machine learning, but ideally, if you can avoid\
    \ it \u2013 don't try to build a machine learning startup. Try to find a problem\
    \ that you can genuinely solve. A random example \u2013 say you want to help grocery\
    \ stores get rid of \u2018out of stock\u2019 situations. You think, \u201COh,\
    \ I'm going to build better forecasting models for them.\u201D But then when you\
    \ come and talk to them, you might learn that it's not the forecasting that\u2019\
    s the problem. Instead they maybe don't even have the data about what they have\
    \ in the store."
  sec: 454
  time: '7:34'
  who: Elena
- line: "The solution for them would be to actually build some sort of data collection\
    \ maybe through something else. If you solve this problem, you don't even need\
    \ machine learning. You can create value with just this. But if you come into\
    \ it with the mindset, \u201CNo, I only want to do modeling.\u201D You might pass\
    \ this opportunity by, right? So it's better if you come with an open mind, if\
    \ you can. That said, I know many people who will get stuck on a technology and\
    \ it becomes a \u201Chammer in search of a nail\u201D situation. Some people succeed\
    \ with this approach, but if you can, it would probably be best to try and avoid\
    \ it."
  who: Elena
- line: So if all I want to do is machine learning, then maybe a startup is not the
    best way of doing this? There's Kaggle and other websites, right?
  sec: 522
  time: '8:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I think in general, if you come to a startup, your role will change\
    \ so much. Therefore you shouldn\u2019t come into it with the mindset of \u201C\
    Hey, I want to do this and this is the only thing I know.\u201D You can take this\
    \ approach if you're an employee in a company with a predefined role and understand\
    \ what exists in the market. With a startup, you'll be constantly doing very different\
    \ things."
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Elena
- line: "That said, I think there are some ways you can search for ideas, whether\
    \ it might be related to machine learning or not. One would be actually to look\
    \ at your own problems or even better, the problems of your company. Because when\
    \ you are inside some business, you can observe some things like inefficiencies,\
    \ come up with an idea, and say \u201CHey, let's test it. Is it big enough of\
    \ a problem? Are people actually experiencing pain with this problem? Do they\
    \ want to pay to solve it?\u201D and these sorts of things."
  who: Elena
- line: "Specifically for machine learning, I would definitely advise trying to team\
    \ up with someone whose main expertise is in an area that you're interested in.\
    \ Just as an example, this can be people who are into insurance, finance, healthcare,\
    \ or whatever it is. I think the best way to create value in machine learning\
    \ right now is to apply it to other vertical domains. But for that, you would\
    \ typically need someone who can explain the fundamentals to you. You don't want\
    \ to be reinventing the wheel and coming up with algorithms and making things\
    \ that are obvious, like \u201CHey, I can do this great stuff!\u201D But it turns\
    \ out to have been done a million times before."
  who: Elena
- line: "I would also suggest maybe to follow other startups. Because if you don't\
    \ yet understand principles like \u201CWhat is a startup?\u201D \u201CWhat is\
    \ valuable on the market?\u201D \u201CWhat can become a company?\u201D You first\
    \ need to just develop this sense of what's going on by following what others\
    \ are doing by following investment news, what type of companies have been started,\
    \ and so on. This can give you an idea of what\u2019s going on in the market.\
    \ But don't try to search for an original idea. I think this is a caveat that\
    \ many people fall into. It\u2019s like a trap. \u201CHey, someone else is already\
    \ doing this. No. I should come up with something that has absolutely never existed\
    \ before.\u201D Typically, these become things that are not really needed. More\
    \ often than not, they just try to come up with some shiny thing that no one will\
    \ ever use."
  who: Elena
- line: "So basically, to come up with an idea, there are some ways to go about it\
    \ that are better than others. You can try to find some problems in your own life\
    \ and see if there is something easy that you can do to fix them. Or you team\
    \ up with somebody who has a background in insurance or some other domain that\
    \ you\u2019re interested in and they can tell you about the problems they have.\
    \ Then, together, you can think about the solution to these problems. So you would\
    \ need a non-technical co-founder who is a domain expert in some particular area."
  sec: 640
  time: '10:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I wouldn't say it's necessarily these are the best way, rather just some\
    \ of the ways how you can find better problems than just by searching for it yourself.\
    \ Ideally, if this person is as involved as they should be, they should become\
    \ a co-founder. But you can also start a startup with people you know, and you\
    \ don't have to be business people. Actually, I think a lot of companies are started\
    \ by technical founders. If you're ready to learn and pick up some things and\
    \ do some sales, probably \u2013 that is not comfortable for many technical people.\
    \ This doesn\u2019t mean that it will necessarily be this way. You can still learn\
    \ everything you need to succeed."
  sec: 672
  time: '11:12'
  who: Elena
- header: Finding a co-founder
- line: "Yeah, let's talk a bit about finding a co-founder. Let's say I am a technical\
    \ person. I know some machine learning. I know how to code. I'm not good at sales\
    \ \u2013 I don't enjoy selling things. I want to find somebody who might enjoy\
    \ doing these things and maybe also be the main expert in some area. How do I\
    \ go about doing this? Who do I need to start with and how do I find these people?"
  sec: 704
  time: '11:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think there is no silver bullet for this. This question is almost like\
    \ \u201CHow do I find my best friends?\u201D There\u2019s really no predefined\
    \ recipe to do it. One thing I can say is that, ideally, you should have worked\
    \ with this person before. In teams that have just met, it's very difficult to\
    \ check how compatible you are. Being co-founders is a lot more than just being\
    \ colleagues. When you\u2019re colleagues, you can maybe be okay with most things\
    \ \u2013 you don't have to agree about everything, especially on the values level.\
    \ But when it comes to being co-founders, if you're successful, you have to be\
    \ together for 5-10 years, working day and night. Therefore you should really\
    \ click with this person and understand each other. It's a very personal thing."
  sec: 736
  time: '12:16'
  who: Elena
- line: "There are people who can work together successfully and people who can\u2019\
    t, and you should really check for this kind of personal compatibility. Also consider\
    \ your motivations. Sometimes people say, \u201CHey, I'm gonna join you in this\
    \ startup, but only if you pay me this money.\u201D Or something like \u201COnly\
    \ if it's successful in the first year.\u201D But a startup is a really hard journey,\
    \ so you should check each other\u2019s expectations beforehand."
  who: Elena
- line: "In terms of how exactly to find these people \u2013 I think it\u2019s worth\
    \ looking at your past colleagues and people that you've worked with \u2013 maybe\
    \ as partners, maybe as clients, maybe you went to school with them \u2013 that\
    \ is usually the better way. However, I've also heard how people just sometimes\
    \ meet each other at hackathons or other events. Usually, they still work together\
    \ a bit, right? Maybe not at a startup, but for some projects or some events.\
    \ This way you can get a feeling of how well you communicate with person and in\
    \ general, how well you get along with them."
  who: Elena
- line: So maybe you can do a hackathon project together and then you see how well
    you get along?
  sec: 825
  time: '13:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Maybe. Yeah, but a hackathon is a bit of an artificial thing. I think ideally\
    \ you should have at least one situation when you had some adversity \u2013 where\
    \ something went wrong."
  sec: 830
  time: '13:50'
  who: Elena
- line: Like a conflict?
  sec: 844
  time: '14:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: A conflict, right. Or just a difficult situation. It will be helpful to see
    how you deal with that, not just some one-time project where no one really cares
    about what's going on.
  sec: 845
  time: '14:05'
  who: Elena
- line: "I also heard about this, especially in Berlin, there are meetups like that.\
    \ I think they're called \u2018co-founder dating meetups\u2019. What do you think\
    \ about these events?"
  sec: 853
  time: '14:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think it can work. You\u2019re still expanding your network, right? Naturally.\
    \ This is another way to expand your network with the people who are active and\
    \ interested. I think joining different communities is a great way to meet people.\
    \ But it often just happens organically, from your first work or something else.\
    \ But whether you need these meetups? It's a cool community conference, anything\
    \ can happen."
  sec: 863
  time: '14:23'
  who: Elena
- line: "But I think you said that it\u2019s best if you work with somebody."
  sec: 884
  time: '14:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Work as in work on something \u2013 not necessarily in the same company.\
    \ One thing I can add to this is that I think there is a thing called \u2018Founder\
    \ Market Fit\u2019. When you understand that you are the right founders to tackle\
    \ a specific problem. This is something that you should consider, but it\u2019\
    s just one example. Sometimes, there are companies that go after the enterprise\
    \ market, which is very sales heavy. You go on, you try to sell a very expensive\
    \ thing, and you sign a very long contract. Their sales is one of their core capabilities."
  sec: 894
  time: '14:54'
  who: Elena
- line: "Then there are startups where you can be creating a tool for developers and\
    \ your main capability is actually being able to understand these developers \u2013\
    \ communicating in their language, so to speak. There might be equally great ideas\
    \ and equally great market opportunities, but you as a founder of a team might\
    \ be better suited to tackle this or that idea. This is something that people\
    \ sometimes don't take into account. But I would definitely recommend checking\
    \ for this."
  who: Elena
- line: "Also you need to choose your market. Because, again, if you're successful,\
    \ you want to be in this market, following these trends, talking to these people\
    \ \u2013 for years to come. Even if the technology might look similar, you're\
    \ doing machine learning. In my previous startup, where we were working with manufacturing\
    \ \u2013 I was talking to heads of manufacturing companies. Now we are working\
    \ with data scientists. It's a very, very different market in how you communicate\
    \ with them. You should be comfortable with what area you choose."
  who: Elena
- line: "How do I choose? How do I know if I like manufacturing, for example, if I\u2019\
    ve never worked with it?"
  sec: 978
  time: '16:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Ideally, you shouldn\u2019t go to a market that you don't know anything about."
  sec: 982
  time: '16:22'
  who: Elena
- line: Or we should probably have a co-founder who has experience in the market,
    right?
  sec: 985
  time: '16:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. Or find someone who can help you get that.
  sec: 989
  time: '16:29'
  who: Elena
- line: "So what are the things that I should consider? Let's say there is an idea.\
    \ There is a co-founder. We seem to like each other \u2013 we go along well with\
    \ each other."
  sec: 995
  time: '16:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: At least you try to.
  sec: 1011
  time: '16:51'
  who: Elena
- header: What should you consider before starting a startup?
- line: Yes. Which things should we consider before we actually start a startup?
  sec: 1015
  time: '16:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I suggest that you should agree at least on a few things between you. It\
    \ makes sense to really spell it out for each other. Sometimes people expect different\
    \ things, but you don't understand it until you start talking to one another.\
    \ So be honest with yourself \u2013 why are you doing what you\u2019re doing and\
    \ how long are you planning to be in this game? I've heard about this problem\
    \ multiple times."
  sec: 1024
  time: '17:04'
  who: Elena
- line: "In general, co-founder breakups are probably one of the most popular things\
    \ for why early stage startups fail \u2013 when people really have different expectations.\
    \ They think, \u201CWell, I'm gonna be here for years!\u201D and then go to work\
    \ for Google. Another person says, \u201CHey, I'm going to really put everything\
    \ into this startup. I\u2019ll work days and nights for it.\u201D So you should\
    \ be honest in this communication. Why you're doing what you\u2019re doing and\
    \ how committed you are. It's better to know these things early on, if you have\
    \ very different views on what's going on."
  who: Elena
- line: "Then I think you should decide what type of company you want to build. Here,\
    \ if you're new to this whole startup thing, a very important thing to understand\
    \ is that startups are a very special breed of companies. If you want to raise\
    \ venture capital, you should build a fundable venture startup \u2013 something\
    \ that goes after a really big market. Something that can become a unicorn (1\
    \ billion dollar valuation). Something that can grow really fast. At the same\
    \ time, it doesn't necessarily need to be profitable in the early days. It can\
    \ bring you money later on. The core idea is that you want to build this company\
    \ that grows really fast and has a chance of becoming something really, really\
    \ big."
  who: Elena
- line: "At the same time, you can take a different route. For example, you can just\
    \ build a service company where you create projects, according to clients\u2019\
    \ needs \u2013 whatever they want, like custom projects \u2013 you build them,\
    \ you get revenue, you get profits, and spend them on your own things. This is\
    \ not the venture way. You cannot raise venture capital with that. Sometimes people\
    \ just don't figure these things out in the early days. Especially if they are\
    \ not accustomed to the way venture capital works. Many things there are really\
    \ counterintuitive. Like not having profits \u2013 profit is a bad thing. It means\
    \ that you're not spending money on growth, right?"
  who: Elena
- line: "You should really understand and learn a little bit about this and decide\
    \ if this is for you, because it really is a very special thing. You will have\
    \ to go raise money, talk to investors, pitch yourself, and so on. Maybe this\
    \ type of work is not necessarily for you. Maybe all you want is to have a relatively\
    \ small growing business. That\u2019s okay, too. You just need to really understand\
    \ which one you want."
  who: Elena
- line: How do I understand that?
  sec: 1160
  time: '19:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Well, you should really think about this venture capital startup concept.\
    \ Understand the benefits and the problems and then decide whether you want to\
    \ try it or not. If you don't, you\u2019re probably going after a more classic\
    \ business approach, right? Then you can maybe take out a loan, you can invest\
    \ in it yourself, and you can build it up. That's a great thing. Actually, you\
    \ can be better off financially by doing this type of business \u2013 compared\
    \ to a failed startup that tried to go to the Moon and didn\u2019t."
  sec: 1166
  time: '19:26'
  who: Elena
- line: So it's about how ambitious you are? If you're very ambitious, if you want
    to conquer the world, then you go into venture capitals. If you want to just have
    one client and start developing a solution for them silently, then you just bootstrap
    yourself.
  sec: 1191
  time: '19:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Well, bootstrapping can still be done for venture capital startups in the\

    \ very, very small team working with them, because one day you can just up and\
    \ say \u201CHey, we're gonna throw away everything we did. Now let's redo it.\
    \ Let's change the course completely.\u201D So it's better done in a very small\
    \ team and you don't want to spend a lot of money on it. But once you understand,\
    \ \u201COkay, this is the thing that we're building. There's a demand for it.\
    \ Now we are moving more to the scaling phase, or to building up more features\
    \ that the users want, or to being able to serve more users.\u201D That\u2019\
    s when you should hire. But you should be guided by the actual business needs,\
    \ not because, \u201CHey, I have a feature list of 100 ideas. I need to hire as\
    \ many engineers as I can to build all this\u201D. You should be more focused\

    \ getting, are they pivoting, what kind of clients do they have? Is there a specific\
    \ way for people to follow other startups?"

    \ Twitter, you\u2019re in some Slacks, you read TechCrunch. I wouldn't suggest\
    \ just going crazy and trying to keep up with everything that's happening \u2013\
    \ you just won\u2019t be able to. But it's just helpful, especially if you were\
    \ not exposed to this before, to look at some investment news, and maybe try to\
    \ decode, \u201CHey, what are they doing? Why were they attractive to investors?\u201D\
    \ Just learn and kind of reverse engineer their success a little bit."

    \ to try to do. Ideally, in a nicer way \u2013 so you don't have to risk all your\
    \ money or something like that. These days, there\u2019s a good opportunity to\
    \ do that. There is a lot of capital available, there are programs that support\
    \ you. But I also suggest being honest about your intentions. Don't just follow\
    \ the hype and think \u201CHey, I'm going to be giving talks everywhere because\
    \ I'm a startup founder!\u201D and enjoy this social part of it. Because it's actually\
    \ a very hard thing to do. You shouldn\u2019t go for it just for fun or just for\
    \ money. You should be genuinely interested in what\u2019s you\u2019re doing."
