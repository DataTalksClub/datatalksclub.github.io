transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about learning product management. We have a special
    guest today, Greg. Greg works as a technology manager at Amazon, where he builds
    AI products from the ground up. You've probably seen him many times on LinkedIn
    where he shares a lot of useful resources. Welcome to our event, Greg.
  sec: 66
  time: '1:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you so much, Alexey. Thank you for having me, letting me talk to you
    and lending the ears of the audience today as well. Hopefully, you're doing great
    on your side and that your year is off to a good start.

  time: '1:28'
  who: Greg
- header: "Greg\u2019s background"
- line: Thanks for joining us. So before we go into our main topic of product management,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 103
  time: '1:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Absolutely. I started in manufacturing \u2013 I'm an industrial engineer.\
    \ I also have a Master's in engineering management with a focus around supply\
    \ chain and business. In manufacturing, I had the opportunity to rotate around\
    \ different positions, whether it's supply chain ops management, quality/safety\
    \ management. In manufacturing I also had a chance to be a product manager who\
    \ was responsible for value chain optimization, and especially pricing optimization,\
    \ which was very fun. That was before I joined Amazon in building some systems\
    \ that are either AI-based or non-AI-based, which make sure to keep customers\
    \ safe when they go online and purchase the products."
  sec: 114
  time: '1:54'
  who: Greg
- line: So you were managing actual products, I mean, physical products before that,
    right?
  sec: 165
  time: '2:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Before that, it was physical products and understanding the value chain\
    \ from the time you put a strategy towards purchasing raw materials to putting\
    \ a strategy behind where you want to manufacture these products \u2013 how much\
    \ it costs you to produce them, which are the distribution centers, the price\
    \ of the products, and the marketing strategy \u2013 all that stuff. All of these\
    \ strategies in data that you're pulling \u2013 the role is to optimize the margin\
    \ for all of these products given that you're creating value for the customers\
    \ that you serve as a B2B company in the chemical industry."
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Greg
- line: "It was quite interesting to be able to collaborate with different groups\
    \ from the commercial team, sales folks, and also finance, marketing, and transportation\
    \ teams. It was good to be kind of in the middle, and to coordinate all of this\
    \ \u2013 to make sure that the execution of each department was done on time and\
    \ delivered exactly what the customer expected to receive or beyond."
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Greg
- line: So a product manager is not an IT-specific role, right?
  sec: 259
  time: '4:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No. I would say, it even varies by department and not only by company. Instead\
    \ of a company, there could be different roles a product manager can take. My\
    \ latest role in the manufacturing setting as a product manager was developing\
    \ what I call \u201Cdata products\u201D. What I call data products is kind of\
    \ like a hub aggregator of data that provides certain services to its clients.\
    \ My clients were internal \u2013 when you think about a group of sales folks\
    \ who often struggle to understand where to get data, how to get data, and perform\
    \ some quick analysis to make quick decisions or informed decisions."
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Greg
- line: "I would build key dashboards that were run on top of curated pipelines. That\
    \ helped them build different things such as putting together a contract in less\
    \ than five days, where they are able to explore the distribution routings, the\
    \ transportation capacity, assess the clients\u2019 demand over a period of time,\
    \ forecast this demand, assess the pricing, assess the pricing of their competitors,\
    \ work with marketing data to understand what kind of discount this customer needs\
    \ to have, or even understanding what the historical data of that customer was\
    \ \u2013 to understand what kind of new value proposition they can put on the\
    \ table for that customer."
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Greg
- line: The goal was to generate these kinds of contracts very fast so they don't
    lose the opportunity to book long-term contracts with these customers. For that,
    they needed access to curated data and to minimize the time it takes to transform
    that data in order to generate insights.
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Greg
- header: Responsibilities of Data Product Manager
- line: "That's quite a lot of things. You mentioned marketing, pricing, transportation,\
    \ and then building this internal data product. Is this what a typical product\
    \ manager does? Let's take a data team at a usual IT company, not a manufacturing\
    \ company. Let's say the company has a website \u2013 could be an ecommerce website.\
    \ What could the role of a product manager be in the data team of such a company?\
    \ What are they usually responsible for?"
  sec: 401
  time: '6:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's good to make the distinction between data product management and traditional\
    \ product management. In traditional product management, there are a lot of data\
    \ products that are being sold to external customers \u2013 that are being managed,\
    \ developed, and implemented via the traditional product management principles\
    \ and best practices. What I\u2019m talking about, specifically, is data product\
    \ management for products that are being served internally. In this case, your\
    \ customers are sales folks, marketing, finance, supply chain \u2013 any program\
    \ teams that can leverage these services, or these products, to consume and make\
    \ decisions that generate value for the company."
  sec: 433
  time: '7:13'
  who: Greg
- line: "When we think about the traditional product management best practices versus\
    \ data product management best practices, they have a common principle that they\
    \ both share, which is to always start with your customers needs \u2013 always\
    \ start with identifying the customers\u2019 pain points, and then derive a strategy\
    \ for addressing that pain point. This is where they both come together under\
    \ that same principle, from which they can work backwards to figure out how to\
    \ devise a solution for these problems \u2013 pain points \u2013 and also how\
    \ they can build a roadmap based on agreed upon strategy that they can deliver\
    \ for the customer in order to generate value."
  sec: 433
  time: '7:13'
  who: Greg
- line: "Most of the time, generating value means that the service or the agreement\
    \ that this product has made is served with regards to expected service-level\
    \ agreement. Whatever the problem these customers are facing, the mission of that\
    \ product is to solve that problem. If you think about a sandwich, the mission\
    \ of that sandwich is to fill up the belly to satisfy somebody's hunger, for example.\
    \ After the customer consumes that sandwich, the mission is that hunger goes away.\
    \ Just a simple example of the term. And if you look at the simple definition\
    \ of a product by itself, it simply means \u201Can artifact or a substance that\
    \ is manufactured into a service\u201D. So it\u2019s manufactured into a final\
    \ output that generates value for a consumer."
  sec: 433
  time: '7:13'
  who: Greg
- line: "Basically, the role of a product manager is to identify the needs of a customer,\
    \ think how these needs can be addressed, and then derive a vision/strategy. Then\
    \ you said that they work backwards and eventually build the service that solves\
    \ this particular pain point \u2013 this need. This whole thing \u2013 this service\
    \ \u2013 is what a product is, right? It\u2019s something that solves a particular\
    \ problem for a particular group of people."
  sec: 634
  time: '10:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That\u2019s correct."
  sec: 667
  time: '11:07'
  who: Greg
- line: "Then you mentioned that it is common for both traditional product managers\
    \ and data product managers \u2013 both have clients and both solve problems,\
    \ except that in one case, traditional product managers solve problems of external\
    \ clients, while data product managers usually address the needs of internal clients.\
    \ Is that right?"
  sec: 668
  time: '11:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Correct. For example, in data product management there could be a recommendation\
    \ system, which is something that I would call a data product. A recommendation\
    \ system is often used by external customers. Therefore, a traditional product\
    \ manager is capable of managing a recommendation system, given that this product\
    \ manager gathers specific skills to manage these recommendation systems. Let's\
    \ explore some of the skills in general. You're talking about designing skills,\
    \ strategy, analytical skills, and technical skills \u2013 in other words, skills\
    \ that let you become able to manage a data product for external customers and\
    \ to be able to have conversations with engineers from a technical design/technical\
    \ implementation or architecture perspective."
  sec: 692
  time: '11:32'
  who: Greg
- line: "A recommendation system can be managed through traditional product management,\
    \ but a leg up that traditional product management has is that there is this UX\
    \ design aspect of it, where, for example, these products can be served on the\
    \ website, they have a good design on the website. Whereas internally, when you\
    \ think about pure data products, the UX design is probably lacking \u2013 meaning\
    \ you're collecting all of the data, aggregating them under one roof, and then\
    \ serving them to downstream clients who can consume that. Think about how you\
    \ would design a user interface for something like this. There are limitations.\
    \ There's an opportunity for internal data product management to invite UX designers\
    \ to understand how to design that user interface for them. I'm hoping I'm making\
    \ the distinction between the two."
  sec: 692
  time: '11:32'
  who: Greg
- header: Understanding customer journey
- line: "With all these responsibilities \u2013 regardless whether it\u2019s internal\
    \ or external \u2013 it's quite a lot of things to do for a product manager. In\
    \ your opinion, why is it useful for data professionals who are not product managers,\
    \ such as data analysts, data engineers, data scientists \u2013 why could it be\
    \ a good idea to also learn a bit of product management?"
  sec: 843
  time: '14:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think it helps because it prepares your mental model for always starting\
    \ at the end \u2013 with the end in mind. \u201CEnd in mind\u201D meaning that\
    \ you\u2019re envisioning a \u201CNorth Star\u201D service or product that addresses\
    \ key pain points for your customers. With that mental model, you're capable of\
    \ figuring out \u201CWho are the stakeholders that allow you to fulfill this mission?\u201D\
    \ With that, they are also capable of understanding the customer journey, which\
    \ is a key part of designing a solution for your customers."
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Greg
- line: "What that gives you, as a data analyst or data scientist, or any other data\
    \ professional, is the ability to acquire domain knowledge. If you're able to\
    \ express and understand the customer journey for a data product, served on web,\
    \ for example, being able to design express details of that customer journey from\
    \ the time they enter the website, navigate through, click the different products\
    \ until conversion \u2013 meaning until they accept to purchase the product or\
    \ service and consume it and feel satisfied \u2013 being able to map that out\
    \ is something that will make you a more powerful data analyst, a more powerful\
    \ data scientist, or a more powerful data professional. Being able to acquire\
    \ these skills can only help to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical\
    \ teams."
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Greg
- line: "What is a customer journey? I think I understood from your description that\
    \ this is a journey that a customer makes. So let's say they want to purchase\
    \ a pair of headphones \u2013 they go to an ecommerce website. First, they need\
    \ to find what they need, \u2013 wireless or wired headphones, big ones, small\
    \ ones. So first, they look for what they need, then maybe look at reviews and\
    \ then finally they make a decision, click the \u201CBuy\u201D button, and then\
    \ enter their credit card details. A few days later they unpack their thing and\
    \ start listening to music. So that's the journey, right?"
  sec: 1000
  time: '16:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That's the customer journey. Exactly. If you're the product manager for the\
    \ website that serves all these products \u2013 headphones and things like that\
    \ \u2013 whether you're a product manager or a data professional, you need to\
    \ understand that customer journey. You can design key solutions, once you identify\
    \ those pain points, or the roadblocks that would prevent a customer from purchasing\
    \ your product."
  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Greg
- line: "How can I understand the customer journey better? Let's say as a data scientist\
    \ \u2013 what do I do for that?"
  sec: 1074
  time: '17:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Obviously, you will not be able to be on the grassroots of things where you're
    deep diving all the time. So that's why you need different teams. The best practice
    is probably to do interviews. Most of the time, data scientists don't have access
    to the external customers, or the final consumers. Therefore, it's best to interview
    your business partners, the product managers, or the department heads, business
    analysts, etc. to help understand the current standard operating procedures or
    operational steps when transactions are made for that product.
  sec: 1081
  time: '18:01'
  who: Greg
- line: "That's probably the best way \u2013 read documentation about these processes\
    \ \u2013 at this point, you will be able to gain knowledge. But one of the most\
    \ powerful tools that people often forget to use, which is available to us all,\
    \ is the will to ask questions, or rather people forget to ask the right questions\
    \ at first. Asking the right questions comes with experience. When you're new\
    \ in the field of data science or anything like that, I always find that those\
    \ who become very powerful, very effective, and very efficient, are the ones who\
    \ are willing to ask a lot of questions so they can learn and adjust and discover.\
    \ This is a soft skill that's definitely needed when it comes to discovering domain\
    \ knowledge. Good data scientists, or good data professionals, are good detectives.\
    \ That's probably the best way I can think about that."
  sec: 1081
  time: '18:01'
  who: Greg
- line: "So you need to be a good detective and find business partners, business analysts,\
    \ product managers, domain experts \u2013 and ask them questions. It doesn't have\
    \ to be great questions. You just need to ask something to understand the topic\
    \ better. With time, you will learn how to ask the right questions."
  sec: 1204
  time: '20:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely.
  sec: 1226
  time: '20:26'
  who: Greg
- header: Interviewing business partners and decision-makers
- line: "You mentioned that people need to interview. How would you go about interviewing\
    \ these business partners \u2013 how would you structure this? Let's say we want\
    \ to set up a meeting just to learn more about the customer journey, more about\
    \ operations. First, you just find a domain expert and then schedule a meeting\
    \ with them. So how do you structure this meeting? How do you structure this interview?\
    \ What do you ask them?"
  sec: 1228
  time: '20:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "What I would advise in that case is, again \u2013 start with the end in mind.\
    \ It's not good to just schedule a meeting without a structure. That's why I like\
    \ this questioning strategy, because you want to set a meeting with purpose. What\
    \ is the purpose of setting up the meeting? Are you setting up a meeting to simply\
    \ learn the general operations of the business? Or are you trying to surface the\
    \ pain points of the business? Or are you trying to learn what the key goals are\
    \ and then setting up a framework for identifying what the obstacles are that\
    \ could prevent you from reaching these key business goals? Or are you trying\
    \ to surface opportunities that will create an uptick or an increase in those\
    \ metrics that help you reach those business goals?"
  sec: 1258
  time: '20:58'
  who: Greg
- line: "Start with the purpose of the meeting. Most of the time, it's to understand\
    \ what the business is trying to do, which is understanding what the business\
    \ goals are. Then you need to create a list of questions to identify the different\
    \ obstacles that you're experiencing \u2013 that are posing a threat to reaching\
    \ these goals, or even identifying the current limitations you have that could\
    \ represent a threat to reach these goals. Then these data scientists can go back\
    \ and figure out how to generate, or deploy, new features that allow them to reduce\
    \ these limitations, add more capabilities, or remove obstacles so that these\
    \ goals can be met."
  sec: 1258
  time: '20:58'
  who: Greg
- line: "How do you identify these obstacles? What kind of questions to ask? Is it\
    \ like, \u201COkay, tell me about your day? What are you struggling with?\u201D\
    \ Or what kind of questions should be asked?"
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. That can be done through some specific use cases, right? One of the\
    \ most famous ones could be, \u201CWell, last year, we made a million dollars\
    \ (for easy numbers) and last year, around the same time, we're already at a million\
    \ dollars in the year. This year we're down 30% compared to last year. We're not\
    \ making money and we're trying to figure out what's going on.\u201D There are\
    \ a lot of frameworks, and me being from manufacturing, I typically go with the\
    \ \u201Cfive whys\u201D when I interview people. \u201CWell, why do you think\
    \ that's happening?\u201D \u201CWell, customers are leaving us. They're not going\
    \ to the website anymore to purchase.\u201D Asking those \u201Cfive why's\u201D\
    \ allows you to gather preliminary answers from the business, which most of the\
    \ time I think data professionals can take with a grain of salt."
  sec: 1400
  time: '23:20'
  who: Greg
- line: Business folks tend to leverage their intuition and their experience about
    the market to kind of deduct certain things. That is if they didn't have time
    to deep dive into data. This is where data scientists, or data professionals,
    can go back into the data and kind of reconcile these hypotheses, or make correlations
    between what they've first heard about the problems. With that, that could be
    a reason why customer churns are happening. With proper design skills, they can
    understand how to address this or find the root cause.
  sec: 1400
  time: '23:20'
  who: Greg
- line: "For example, for customer churn, they can find out whether it was due to\
    \ a feature that was released on the website that caused the customers to be confused,\
    \ and miss clicking the \u201CBuy\u201D button since that feature launch, which\
    \ has caused a reduction in sales. So all of these \u201Cworking backwards\u201D\
    \ tasks help you identify what happened. Maybe it was an external event that happened.\
    \ For example, let's say that COVID was the event that caused a downturn in your\
    \ sales. Being able to work backwards to figure out that root cause is what data\
    \ scientists can do when they're analyzing data."
  sec: 1400
  time: '23:20'
  who: Greg
- header: Products sense, product mindset, and product roadmap
- line: "Yeah, thank you. We have a question from Peter. Actually, I have a similar\
    \ one. The question from Peter is, \u201CWhat is product sense?\u201D What I would\
    \ add to this is \u2013 is it similar to the product mindset? To me, they seem\
    \ like synonyms \u201Cproduct sense\u201D, \u201Cproduct mindset\u201D. What are\
    \ these things? Do you know?"
  sec: 1585
  time: '26:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Product sense? I don't hear that term often, but I have an idea. There's\
    \ no firm definition for this. Product sense to me is a mindset, I would say \u2013\
    \ the mindset of being able to understand the characteristics and limitations\
    \ of your product with regards to your customers\u2019 needs and being able to\
    \ derive a roadmap and strategy that address these expected and unexpected needs\
    \ of your customers."
  sec: 1609
  time: '26:49'
  who: Greg
- line: "It\u2019s about understanding the trends of these products, the trends of\
    \ the market, the trends of your customers\u2019 behaviors \u2013 because needs\
    \ change over time. A product sense to me is more of a mindset that entails different\
    \ things from understanding the external and internal forces that drive the performance\
    \ of your product."
  sec: 1609
  time: '26:49'
  who: Greg
- line: "This is something that everyone can have? It's not only a thing that product\
    \ managers can have, but everyone on the team, every data professional, non-data\
    \ professional, frontend engineer, backend engineer \u2013 everyone can have that.\
    \ Right? It's about understanding the characteristics of your product and understanding\
    \ the limitations. You also mentioned defining roadmaps and strategies. This is\
    \ also part of that. So how, as the data professional, can I take part in defining\
    \ a roadmap? I assume this is usually what a product manager does. So how can\
    \ I help my product manager work on the roadmap? And what do I need for that?"
  sec: 1685
  time: '28:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: "If you're a data professional, you're on the business team as a data analyst,\
    \ a business analyst, or you're on the tech side, even an ML engineer or a data\
    \ engineer, etc. Since product roadmaps are led by product managers, the best\
    \ practice is involving all your stakeholders into this. You need to understand\
    \ whether you will be able to deliver what you're promised to deliver. That, especially\
    \ the technical side, will be responsible for \u201CT-shirt sizing\u201D the efforts\
    \ it takes to deploy the key features of your product."
  sec: 1733
  time: '28:53'
  who: Greg
- line: "As a data professional, the contribution that you can make is to provide\
    \ that \u201CT said sizing\u201D in terms of effort. For example, if a feature\
    \ requires the build of key data pipelines that require real time inference from\
    \ machine learning, a data professional on the technical side is responsible for\
    \ providing advice and aligning on timeline to ensure that the underlying infrastructure\
    \ is either present or there's a strategy for establishing that infrastructure\
    \ which gives you those key pipelines, which in turn enable these features that\
    \ you want to release in an XYZ timeframe."
  sec: 1733
  time: '28:53'
  who: Greg
- line: When you think about it, it's definitely something that data professionals
    are already doing. It's a matter of whether your organization is applying these
    best practices where product managers are inviting everybody at the table to provide
    their opinions and advice on how to move the needle.
  sec: 1733
  time: '28:53'
  who: Greg
- line: "What is \u201CT shirt sizing\u201D? Is it taking something big and complex\
    \ and chunking it into smaller things?"
  sec: 1874
  time: '31:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: "\u201CT shirt sizing\u201D is simply providing \u201CHow long does it take?\
    \ What is the cost of me spending time to build this? How long will it take me\
    \ to build this?\u201D etc. Basically, it's determining the effort that it takes\
    \ to build something."
  sec: 1881
  time: '31:21'
  who: Greg
- header: Working backwards
- line: "I guess another thing \u2013 I'm not sure if we talked about this \u2013\
    \ but you mentioned it a few times that you should start with an end in mind.\
