transcript:
- line: "This week, we'll talk about two different roles. We'll talk about the data\
    \ science manager role and the data science expert role. We'll also talk about\
    \ how they are not the same and why they are different. There are probably some\
    \ similarities there as well. We will cover that this week. We have a special\
    \ guest today, Barbara. Barbara is a data scientist by profession. You\u2019re\
    \ a data science manager, right?"

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly.

  time: '1:58'
  who: Barbara
- header: "Barbara\u2019s background"
- line: Welcome, Barbara. Before we go into our main topic, let's start with your
    background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, of course. I graduated with a degree in GIS (geographic information\
    \ systems) from the University in Poznan. I am a specialist in spatial analysis.\
    \ At the time, I learned how to work with very specific data, which are special\
    \ data \u2013 they are different. After graduation, I worked in telecommunication\
    \ components in a Java specialist position. Although I loved this job, after a\
    \ few years, I decided to come back to Poznan and find a new job and change something.\
    \ So, I became a SQL Developer and I learned very well how to work with databases\
    \ and reports. Quite quickly, it stood out that my strong points are analytics\
    \ skills and establishing contact with clients."
  sec: 148
  time: '2:28'
  who: Barbara
- line: "I continued my career as a business intelligence analyst, being responsible\
    \ for the analytic part of the data warehouse construction and reporting projects.\
    \ I also prepared some visualizations and data analysis. At the same time, I also\
    \ became one of the leaders in our BI department, which is how I also developed\
    \ my leadership skills. But I always found that we could do something more with\
    \ data \u2013 some advanced analytics. My goal was to gain more insight from data.\
    \ One day, we decided to build our own data science team. After some time, I became\
    \ a data science manager and I got the opportunity to build my own team and take\
    \ responsibility for the whole data science area. Now, along with my team, we\
    \ are building machine learning solutions. This is the very short story of my\
    \ career journey."
  who: Barbara
- line: What kind of solutions are you building?
  sec: 263
  time: '4:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Now, we have two main topics. One is a model that does predictions for people\
    \ who are suffering from bipolar disease or depression, whether their faces change\
    \ or not. This is important for doctors. The other solution is a small commercial\
    \ project that involves demand forecasting and recommendation, so \u2013 inventory\
    \ optimization."
  sec: 266
  time: '4:26'
  who: Barbara
- header: Do you need a manager or an expert?
- line: "That's quite interesting. Thanks for sharing. I've been following you on\
    \ LinkedIn for quite a while. I think you post regularly \u2013 maybe every week\
    \ or every two weeks I see posts from you. Then some time ago, maybe a few months\
    \ ago, you shared a post that started with \u201CDo you need a data science manager\
    \ or a data science expert?\u201D Can you tell us more about this post?"
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I remember this post very well. This post was about the differences between\
    \ data science managers and data science experts. These two positions are often\
    \ confused between one another, even in the data science world. Often, people\
    \ forget many aspects of managers\u2019 tasks. I often get job offers from various\
    \ headhunters on LinkedIn, and the job titles are \u201Cdata science manager OR\
    \ data science team leader\u201D. But when I analyzed the requirements, I could\
    \ see that 80% of them were very technical. For example, Python programming, machine\
    \ learning solutions, deployment, Kubernetes, Docker, advanced libraries, such\
    \ as TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc."
  sec: 336
  time: '5:36'
  who: Barbara
- line: Only 20% of the requirements had anything to do with soft skills that are
    typical for managers, such as team management, stakeholder expectation management,
    communication, building relations and strategies for the company. Very often people
    confuse a data science manager with data science experts. I know that data science
    is a young field and people don't know what the requirements should be for the
    particular position, and they don't know what kind of person they need in their
    companies. So I want to spread awareness and save time in the process of building
    a data science team in organizations.
  who: Barbara
- line: Who do you think creates such job listings? Is it coming from management who
    might not necessarily yet know what they actually need from a manager? Who usually
    creates these posts? Do you have an idea?
  sec: 433
  time: '7:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think that it\u2019s usually created by some guys from IT \u2013 Head of\
    \ IT, Head of BI, or somebody like this \u2013 and he or she doesn't know exactly\
    \ how data science works. They don\u2019t know what is more important for which\
    \ position. Or sometimes HR creates the job offers and they don't have enough\
    \ knowledge about these positions, \u201CData science. Okay, technical requirements.\
    \ OK. Management \u2013 one point or maybe two points.\u201D"
  sec: 448
  time: '7:28'
  who: Barbara
- header: Technical and non-technical requirements for managers
- line: "What do you think the balance should actually be? Say somebody is looking\
    \ for a manager \u2013 should it be 80% technical, and 20% non-technical? Or should\
    \ it be different?"
  sec: 491
  time: '8:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: It should definitely be different. I think maybe half and half, or something
    along those lines. But I think the most important are the managerial skills.
  sec: 502
  time: '8:22'
  who: Barbara
- line: "The next question I have in my list was, \u201CWhat motivated you to write\
    \ the post?\u201D I guess you answered that \u2013 many headhunters reached out\
    \ to you saying, \u201CHey, we have this amazing job as a data science manager!\u201D\
    \ You open this job, and then you see \u201COkay, this doesn't sound like a managerial\
    \ role.\u201D"
  sec: 516
  time: '8:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it happens.
  sec: 539
  time: '8:59'
  who: Barbara
- line: Do you see such job descriptions very often these days?
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Very often. I see this on LinkedIn and on different job websites. It happens
    very often.
  sec: 546
  time: '9:06'
  who: Barbara
- line: But do you think the reason this happens is because these people want to find
    a manager and just don't know what requirements to put? Or do these people actually
    want to hire an expert and they don't need a manager?
  sec: 558
  time: '9:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think it happens because people need or want to have a data science team\
    \ and they don't know how it works. They think that \u201COkay, we need a manager\
    \ \u2013 we need a team leader. Okay, this person is a data scientist with extremely\
    \ strong knowledge of technical issues plus team management.\u201D This is not\
    \ a good way to do that. This would be something like Head of IT. A data science\
    \ manager is something different from a senior web developer or expert in other\
    \ programming areas."
  sec: 571
  time: '9:31'
  who: Barbara
- header: Importance of technical skills for managers
- line: As I remember from your background story, you were saying that you became
    a data science manager. When you became a data science manager, how much experience
    in data science did you have back then?
  sec: 614
  time: '10:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It depends on how you define \u2018data science\u2019."
  sec: 637
  time: '10:37'
  who: Barbara
- line: "I would define it as knowing all these things \u2013 like machine learning\
    \ and these other technical things that you mentioned \u2013 do you think it's\
    \ important for a manager to know these things?"
  sec: 639
  time: '10:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Okay. So, before I was a manager, I worked for around five or six years.\
    \ This is why I asked what data science means to you, because I worked for 3 years\
    \ as a GIS specialist and it is a very specific part of analytics. But if you\
    \ say data science in general, not only machine learning analyst, but GIS as well\
    \ \u2013 I worked with databases and analyzed some data, prepared visualization,\
    \ etc. So I think before I became a leader, I worked something like five or six\
    \ years general with data."
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Barbara
- line: "Yeah. But I wanted to ask you \u2013 is it really important to get to know\
    \ all these technical things that you mentioned, like Python, Docker, Kubernetes,\
    \ machine learning \u2013 all these technical things? Is it really important for\
    \ a manager to know all that in order to be able to be a good manager?"
  sec: 700
  time: '11:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It is important to understand how it works but on a high level. Maybe I shouldn't\
    \ say this, but I don't use Docker. But I know how it works and this is the most\
    \ important thing. I can talk with my team and we can discuss it because I understand\
    \ how it works. But I don't actually use it. If you have a technical background\
    \ and you can understand how different parts or the technology works \u2013 that\u2019\
    s what\u2019s most important. It is impossible to know everything. Managers need\
    \ to have wide knowledge, but it will be quite shallow as a result. This is the\
    \ difference. Experts need a very deep understanding \u2013 very deep knowledge.\
    \ While managers need wide knowledge, it will be a little bit shallower compared\
    \ to an expert."
  sec: 722
  time: '12:02'
  who: Barbara
- header: Responsibilities and skills of a manager
- line: Yeah, interesting. So experts need deep knowledge and managers need shallow
    knowledge. They just need to know a bit of everything and know what to ask for
    and then just to go to an expert when they need deeper knowledge. Let's talk a
    bit about data science managers. What is a data science manager? What are their
    responsibilities and which skills do they need to have?
  sec: 784
  time: '13:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Data science managers help organizations use data to make the best management
    decision. Of course, he or she has to know what skill set and personality is needed
    for team members. Because a team means there are people. People are not robots.
    We need people to feel good together and work well together. Managers need to
    know who they need and who will fit into the organization and the data team.
  sec: 809
  time: '13:29'
  who: Barbara
- line: They also direct the personal development of each team member. Data science
    managers also show the directions of data science team development and prepare
    strategies for using AI and machine learning technologies in the organization.
    That's why we follow trends in AI and need a wide knowledge of techniques in data
    engineering, data analysis, data visualization, model buildings and deployment,
    ML ops, etc.
  who: Barbara
- line: Managers have a holistic approach to data science projects. They don't only
    know and use technologies and models, but they also communicate with stakeholders
    and business users. They understand all the requirements of the machine learning
    models very well and how it will be used by business users. With this holistic
    approach, they should be able to identify new opportunities to leverage data science
    in various business areas.
  who: Barbara
- line: Of course, like every manager, they should be able to manage problems, for
    example, team members, business expectations, give results for models etc. For
    that is useful to strong critical thinking and problem-solving capabilities. This
    all combines soft and technical skills.
  who: Barbara
- header: Importance of technical background for managers
- line: How hands-on is it? Does a manager actually sit and code? Do they open a Jupyter
    Notebook and tune XGBoost or not? Or not so much?
  sec: 934
  time: '15:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: "[laughs] Sometimes. It always depends on the structure and maturity of the\
    \ organization and the data team. It's also connected with the level of technical\
    \ skills and the background that the person has. So if he or she has trained models\
    \ before, and if not, it depends on his or her determination to learn how to do\
    \ it right. Some managers don't have time to write code and train models. Others\
    \ do, but spend a maximum 50-60% of their time on it. But building models is not\
    \ the core of our duties. It's kind of ironic that our tools are PowerPoint and\
    \ Excel \u2013 we do a lot of presentations."
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Barbara
- line: "But in my opinion, a data science manager should be able to understand technical\
    \ issues very well, analyze results from models, and give some tips on the direction\
    \ in which the team could go. It's important to pose the right questions to the\
    \ team and the business stakeholders. Because it's common for data scientists\
    \ to enter rabbit holes and spend months on a model without any progress. A good\
    \ manager can notice this and pull them out of the hole at the right moment and\
    \ say, \u201CThis is good enough\u201D or show them another direction. This is\
    \ much easier if the manager has a good technical background."
  who: Barbara
- line: You mentioned if the manager has previously trained machine learning models.
    Do you think that it's actually a requirement that they have this experience of
    training a model? Or could they be good managers without this experience?
  sec: 1041
  time: '17:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is possible to be a good manager without this experience. It's harder,
    I think. But it's also possible. It also depends on the organization. I know an
    organization that is quite big and I know that their head of IT (or head of data
    science) is very non-technical. Of course, he did some courses and has some knowledge,
    but he doesn't have hands-on experience. It happens, but it is possible. It depends,
    like always.
  sec: 1054
  time: '17:34'
  who: Barbara
- line: "When you were saying what kind of things managers do \u2013  it would be\
    \ thinking of the team\u2019s development, thinking of each team member\u2019\
    s personal development, preparing strategies, having a holistic approach and communicating\
    \ with stakeholders, identifying opportunities, managing expectations, and critical\
    \ thinking. None of these seem to require writing actual code, right? So people\
    \ can probably be good managers without necessarily having a deep technical background\
    \ in the past, right?"
  sec: 1099
  time: '18:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Right. But I think it's harder to develop a team and say which direction\
    \ they should go, or ask for something when you don't have this kind of background.\
    \ Because when you discuss things with your team, maybe you have some problems\
    \ with models, for example \u2013 and you don't understand how it works. It's\
    \ definitely harder."
  sec: 1144
  time: '19:04'
  who: Barbara
- header: Getting involved in business development and sales
- line: "Yeah. I already see a question related to the responsibilities of data managers.\
    \ \u201CDo you think data managers should be involved with business development\
    \ and sales of projects or not?\u201D"
  sec: 1166
  time: '19:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think yes, because a manager is responsible for the strategy and how the
    organization will prepare different machine learning solutions and who these solutions
    are for, as well as in which business areas they will be applied. I think yes.
    I think that's why managers have more time to do something other than coding,
    while experts don't have enough time.
  sec: 1180
  time: '19:40'
  who: Barbara
- line: "Yeah, because if you have all these responsibilities \u2013 even if you want\
    \ to code, you just simply don't have time."
  sec: 1218
  time: '20:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Yeah. I know this very, very well and have had this problem many,
    many times.'
  sec: 1225
  time: '20:25'
  who: Barbara
- header: Developing the team
- line: "Another related question to what we discussed, \u201CHow do you make sure\
    \ that your team is learning new data skills, trying new tools, and seeing new\
    \ applications every day? How do you do this as a manager?\u201D"
  sec: 1234
  time: '20:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. Well, my team is not too big, so maybe that's why it's easier. Because
    if you have a big team of 20-30 people or something like that, it's harder. My
    team is quite small, so I sit with them every week and we discuss these things.
    I know what they are doing on the product. Sometimes I see the code, because we
    have a repository. We discuss what is good and what's not. Sometimes I ask for
    help from a software engineer, because he has better programming skills and can
    advise me. After that, I can know how well they prepared the code and I see the
    results of the model, of course.
  sec: 1251
  time: '20:51'
  who: Barbara
- line: "I think that it's important to tell each member which direction he or she\
    \ should take and tell them what the goals for the year or for the month are.\
    \ For example, if we have some courses on the website, he or she should take two\
    \ or three courses or something like that. Then I see if they did it or not. I\
    \ also see the result that has on the project and how well it\u2019s working out.\
    \ Because taking the course is one thing and working a commercial project and\
    \ normal life is another. I look at the results and I discuss them with other\
    \ team members and see whether they are good or not."
  who: Barbara
- line: "If I can summarize \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong \u2013 with each team member,\
    \ you individually work on setting goals and choosing the right directions for\
    \ personal development. After that, you pick a couple of courses that should help\
    \ with this particular goal. Then the person takes the course and tries to apply\
    \ what they learned in their job, right?"
  sec: 1363
  time: '22:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, it could be a course or sometimes, if I think that it will be better\
    \ for somebody to learn from other team members\u2026"
  sec: 1391
  time: '23:11'
  who: Barbara
- line: You pair them up, right?
  sec: 1402
  time: '23:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I put them in pairs and I know that the senior will help the regular
    professional. After that I discuss the progress with them both.
  sec: 1403
  time: '23:23'
  who: Barbara
- header: "Checking team\u2019s work"
- line: "Yeah, the other question is \u201CDo you double check the work of your team?\u201D\
    \ I think you mentioned that you take a look at the code. But the reason you do\
    \ this is because you want to suggest the areas for improvement, right? It's not\
    \ like you're double-checking."
  sec: 1416
  time: '23:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I'm not double-checking. They have code reviews and others have different\
    \ things. Yeah, I look sometimes. But I do this maybe once per four models or\
    \ something like that \u2013 when I'm very curious. But I don't double-check.\
    \ They're better programmers than me. [laughs]"
  sec: 1434
  time: '23:54'
  who: Barbara
- line: Do you think managers should do this or not? Should they be technically involved
    in that? Should they review pull requests? If they want, they can do this? Right?
  sec: 1455
  time: '24:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. If they want, they can do this, but it\u2019s not obligatory. I also\
    \ do this sometimes for my own development. I'm curious how they code and what\
    \ is in the project, but this is not something I double-check. It\u2019s like\
    \ \u201COh, okay. We have done another function. Yeah. Oh, this code is better.\
    \ Nice option\u201D"
  sec: 1465
  time: '24:25'
  who: Barbara
- line: So it's more for your own personal development.
  sec: 1491
  time: '24:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I know that the project is going very well. It\u2019s usually like\
    \ \u201CWe\u2019ll have this function in a few months.\u201D \u201COh. Nice.\u201D"
  sec: 1494
  time: '24:54'
  who: Barbara
- header: Data science expert
- line: "So instead of spending time reading some articles, you just go and check\
    \ the code. \u201COh, nice.\u201D And grab some coffee. [laughs] Okay. We talked\
    \ about the manager and we talked about their responsibilities. From the list\
    \ of responsibilities, it doesn't seem super technical \u2013 there are many non-technical\
    \ things. Now let's talk about the data science expert role. So, what is this\
    \ role? Also when I hear the word \u2018expert\u2019 I think \u2013 are we talking\
    \ about the role that comes after senior? We have this usual progression of junior\
    \ professional, middle data scientist, senior, and then there is a role after\
    \ the senior. So is the expert somebody who is after the senior role? Or could\
    \ it be a senior just as well?"
  sec: 1502
  time: '25:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I could say generally, yes \u2013 experts are after seniors. Of course, the\
    \ expert role is different from the manager because he or she needs a very deep\
    \ understanding of algorithms and technologies from the area in which he or she\
    \ has many years of experience. As a result, this person solves many problems\
    \ in this particular field. Very often, an expert doesn\u2019t only have a good\
    \ knowledge of technology, but also domain knowledge. For example, if somebody\
    \ prepares sales forecasting, he or she knows not only time series, prophet or\
    \ GBM, but also how the company sells and what could influence this process. Or\
    \ if somebody works with NLP, he or she knows how the languages work. Or if an\
    \ expert has been preparing a model for logistics for 10 years, he or she has\
    \ not only a deep understanding of algorithms, but also domain knowledge. Thus,\
    \ this person combines these two things very well. That's why I think that an\
    \ expert is very often after a senior. Not always, but very often."
  sec: 1559
  time: '25:59'
  who: Barbara
- line: "So experts know one particular business domain quite well. They know what\
    \ kind of algorithms work there, what kind of feature engineering usually works\
    \ there, how to prepare the model, how to train the model and how to actually\
    \ apply this model \u2013 how to deploy it. So they know all this for this particular\
    \ domain, very, very, very well. Right?"
  sec: 1645
  time: '27:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That's what I explained. [laughs]
  sec: 1670
  time: '27:50'
  who: Barbara
- line: "Yeah, right. [laughs] That sounds very different from the manager's description,\
    \ right? The only kind of non-technical thing was their domain knowledge. But\
    \ I think if we dig deeper, it's actually quite technical. Because it's about\
    \ applying machine learning \u2013 applying data skills \u2013 to a particular\
    \ domain. So it's about using their technical skills to solve business problems.\
    \ I think it's still quite technical. Do you agree?"
  sec: 1674
  time: '27:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Experts are very focused on the technical side of data science. That's\
    \ why it's different from a manager. It\u2019s a different side."
  sec: 1701
  time: '28:21'
  who: Barbara
- header: Hiring experts

    \ \u201COkay, I can do it. Maybe I don\u2019t have all the requirements. Not 100%.\
    \ But 80-70% of the requirements are good enough.\u201D I say this because I see\
    \ that men don't have problems with this and may have only 70% of the requirements\
    \ for the job. But for women, this is a problem. I think this is the most important\
    \ thing. \u201COkay, maybe I'm not a 100% match for the job, but I match 70%.\
    \ Okay, I could try. Maybe not this job. Maybe the next one.\u201D Don't give\
    \ up."

    \ If you have a problem answering this, you should ask your friends or your colleagues,\
    \ and you should find a mentor. I think it's easier if you find a mentor, and\
    \ talk with him or her and ask him or her about everything. So talking with people\
    \ and networking."

    for sharing your stories with us. And thanks, everyone, for asking questions.
    We got quite a few questions. That is there are still six questions that we didn't

    Barbara.
