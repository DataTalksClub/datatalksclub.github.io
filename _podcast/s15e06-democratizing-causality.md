title: Democratizing Causality
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about causality. We have a special guest today, Alexander.
    Alexander is a machine learning researcher, educator, and consultant. He has worked
    with many companies across Europe, in the United States of America, Israel, where
    he designed and built large-scale machine learning systems. He is also known as
    the author of Causal Inference and Discovery in Python – this is the topic of
    today's interview. Welcome to the show, Aleksander.
  sec: 82
  time: '1:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Welcome, Alexey. Thank you for having me and thank you for the invitation.
  sec: 112
  time: '1:52'
  who: Aleksander
- line: You're more than welcome. As usual, the questions for today's interview are
    prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, for your help. Yeah, let's start.
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Alexey
- header: Aleksander's background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of causality. Let's start with your background.
    Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 126
  time: '2:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I started my journey with computers when I was a kid – I was like, 5,
    6, 7 years old – I was doing a little bit of programming, because my father was
    a programmer back then. Then I had a very, very long break. After studying, doing
    my second degree, which was psychology – social psychology, experimental psychology
    with neuroscience and so on – I fell in love with statistics. Looking into and
    Googling about statistics, because I was very interested in this topic, and I
    was also Googling about what is going on in computer science at this stage. I
    learned about Python – this led me to machine learning, and that was the start
    of my journey into this rabbit hole. One of my first machine learning projects
    (real machine learning projects) was a scientific one. We worked on predicting
    – on finding prediagnostic predictors of dyslexia in children. I was very excited
    about this project.
  sec: 135
  time: '2:15'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Actually now, after many, many years, there's a tool being developed that
    will help people diagnose the risk of dyslexia in very young children, which is
    very important because early diagnosis can help those children start specialized
    training that can help them overcome the difficulties in their adult life. From
    there, I started working with an international consulting company called Lingaro.
    That was a place where I started developing many more complex architectures for
    global clients, working with NLP and other models. That was the beginning. Then
    I worked for other companies. Then I moved to Tel Aviv and I worked with a cybersecurity
    company. And then recently, I finished writing my book and then moved to doing
    consulting for companies and focusing on my educator and causal ambassador – causal
    global advocacy work.
  sec: 135
  time: '2:15'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Do you remember as a kid what exactly piqued your interest in programming?
    I have a kid – he's seven years old – and I tried to show him what you can do
    with an algorithm. We bought a robot. It's possible to program a robot – there's
    like this visual interface where you can tell the robot something like, “First,
    take three steps forward, then rotate.” You can create loops there so it can rotate
    10 times or something like that. And he was not impressed at all after I showed
    him that. [laughs] So I'm wondering how to show him that programming is cool.
    Do you remember how it happened to you?
  sec: 285
  time: '4:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know how relevant this will be for you and for him (or for her). [chuckles]
    For me, you know... I didn't have a robot back then. I just had a monochrome display
    PC (186 or 286 or something like this) with GW Basic. I wrote myself a piano –
    I could play melodies using computer keyboards. That was my main achievement back
    then. [chuckles]
  sec: 326
  time: '5:26'
  who: Aleksander
- line: That's amazing. I have no idea what these terms that you mentioned mean, because
    I got a computer pretty late myself. But anyway, thanks for sharing that. I guess
    not every kid should be immediately impressed when they see an algorithm – a robot
    that could be programmed.
  sec: 354
  time: '5:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Perhaps. You know, everyone is different, so... [chuckles]
  sec: 372
  time: '6:12'
  who: Aleksander
- header: Aleksander as a Causal Ambassador
- line: Yeah, right. Now, you focus on education. And did you call yourself a causality
    ambassador?
  sec: 375
  time: '6:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's one way to think about what I'm doing.
  sec: 386
  time: '6:26'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So what does it mean? What do you do as a causality ambassador?
  sec: 390
  time: '6:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: I do a couple of things. I do my best to democratize the set of methods and
    the style of thinking – I think both things are very important here. I have a
    feeling that causality in general is a tool, or a set of tools, that can be very,
    very helpful for individuals and businesses alike. This is just something that,
    for one reason or another, we haven't learned in our curricula. Many people were
    not lucky enough to just get these ideas passed on to them from the teachers,
    from the environment, and so on, and so on. I believe that everyone deserves to
    understand how it works and to have a chance to apply this to their work.
  sec: 396
  time: '6:36'
  who: Aleksander
- line: You said your goal is to democratize this style of thinking. So what exactly
    is this style of thinking? What is causality? How is it different from the usual
    style of thinking?
  sec: 451
  time: '7:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, from the usual style of thinking – I don't know. It probably depends
    where you grew up and in what circumstances, what context, and so on. But thinking
    about the data science community, most people are going into a journey that is
    focused around traditional statistical machine learning, which means that we look
    at associations. Seeing associations is great – it gives us great opportunities
    in many different contexts. But sometimes, it also comes with a set of risks,
    which means that we can see an association and this association might be because
    of another variable that we do not observe. And for whatever reason, we can think
    about this association as a valid tool to make a conclusion that is either implicitly
    or explicitly causal. In other words...
  sec: 466
  time: '7:46'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Do you have an example, maybe? It's a bit abstract.
  sec: 532
  time: '8:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. Let me make it more concrete. So I was just going back from my
    lunch and I was watching YouTube Shorts. You know what that is?
  sec: 535
  time: '8:55'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Yeah, they're addictive. [chuckles]
  sec: 546
  time: '9:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, kind of like Instagram – short movies. And there was one where there
    was a guy speaking and trying to convince the audience that there is a correlation
    between the color of your skin and the likelihood that you will commit violent
    crimes. He was citing different types of statistics for this. So this is an example
    of associated thinking. Maybe we say something like, “Hey, there are people with
    certain properties – physical,  mental, or psychological properties – and there
    are some outcomes. And we think that these outcomes are more frequent for one
    group versus another.” Then if we just speak using this associational language,
    and we talk about those associations, “Here's one, here's another one, here's
    another one.” It's very easy to make people start thinking that this property
    of this group of people is linked to this outcome. Sometimes it might be something
    completely different. So maybe people with this certain property – physical or
    psychological – are also for whatever, let's say, historical reasons in a group
    of people who have much lower income.
  sec: 549
  time: '9:09'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Maybe they have less parenting skills on average within a certain geography
    or location. And this might be also related to the fact that there is more violent
    crime in this particular neighborhood or for a group of people that accidentally
    also have another characteristic. But if we don't look at this third variable,
    we might start implicitly thinking that those two properties that we are observing
    are related. We also usually say “related,” but what we think is “related causally”
    – so there is something that is causing the other thing. From a purely associative
    point of view, or a correlational point of view, we often cannot distinguish which
    type of situation we are in. We might see an association with temperature and
    I don't know... there's an example in my book – it's a very simple example, perhaps
    an intuitive one. Drownings are correlated with ice cream sales. Right?
  sec: 549
  time: '9:09'
  who: Aleksander
- line: I can see where you're going with this. Yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 710
  time: '11:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Somebody who is a scientist might hypothesize that, “Hey, there is sugar in
    ice cream. Maybe people who eat ice cream become a little bit slower to react.”
    And so on and so on. Sometimes after we eat, we feel a little bit like, “Hey,
    maybe I'll have a nap,” especially if it's carbohydrate-rich food. Somebody could
    make a hypothesis like this and invest a large budget in exploring this hypothesis
    – try to falsify it. While there is a common cause and it's temperature. When
    it's warmer, people are more likely to buy ice cream, but they are also more likely
    to go and swim. And if more people are swimming, more people are also, unfortunately,
    drowning (usually).
  sec: 713
  time: '11:53'
  who: Aleksander
- header: Using causality to make decisions
- line: I guess for some applications, we don't need to think about this causality
    – we just see a correlation and we train our logistic regression. I think maybe
    a good example is the famous “B feature” in the Boston dataset. It's also related
    to the color of skin as in the example you mentioned. I think it's the proportion
    of color  of people in the neighborhood in Boston. Then if you train a model,
    maybe this model is accurate, to some extent, because it uses this problematic
    B feature. For some purposes, we will not think about whether it's correct to
    use this feature or not. But maybe it improves the performance of the model. Right?
  sec: 761
  time: '12:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: What you're saying is a very interesting point because, well, statistics is
    just enough for predictive tasks. Now, the problem starts when we want to make
    a decision. Right? If you imagine... There was a very famous case some time ago
    of a company called Zillow. They were actually doing what you described – they
    were trying to predict prices of real estate. Then what they also did based on
    those predictions was deciding if they wanted to buy a real estate and then flip
    it (which means renovate it and sell for a better price, or maybe even without
    renovation – I don't remember what their business model was) or not. This turned
    out to be a very good business for them for a very long time. As long as the distribution
    of all the variables in the background was the same.
  sec: 808
  time: '13:28'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Machine learning models are IID machines, which means that they assume that
    we have the same identically independent and identically distributed dataset in
    training and in the test (or in the real world) and this is not always the case.
    Causal models (depending on the type of a causal model) might address this if
    you have a lot of information – if you have a rich causal representation, you
    can address a situation like this. So if Zillow had a very rich causal model,
    they would not fall because of the fall of the market.
  sec: 808
  time: '13:28'
  who: Aleksander
- line: What happened to them? I heard they...
  sec: 914
  time: '15:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: They went bankrupt, essentially.
  sec: 917
  time: '15:17'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Because of their machine learning models?
  sec: 919
  time: '15:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: They bought a lot of real estate and then the prices went down and they were
    not able to take it.
  sec: 921
  time: '15:21'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So the models were predicting that the prices would go up, but they did not.
    Right?
  sec: 931
  time: '15:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. As far as I remember, that was the case. And they made a decision based
    on this prediction. When we're making a decision... Let me give you another example.
    When we're making a decision – usually, not always... Sometimes we might have
    a decision threshold, like in credit risk, somebody says something like, “Hey,
    if the probability of default is higher than X, we're just not giving money to
    those people.” This might be good enough, depending on what you really want to
    achieve in the long run – this might be really good enough. But we can think about
    another scenario with, let's say, marketing or churn. In marketing, we are interested
    in targeting people who will respond favorably (which means they will purchase).
    If we target them, this will increase the likelihood of purchasing. Because targeting
    every person is spending a little bit of our marketing budget. But there are different
    people, right? Some people might react...
  sec: 936
  time: '15:36'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Some people might just not care if we target them and they will buy anyway.
    Some other people might not buy, regardless if we target them or if we don't target
    them. And there will also be some people that will buy only if we target them
    because maybe they just feel a little bit special when we send them this discount,
    or we give them this personalized email. But there's also the fourth group of
    people who will buy from you as long as you do not target them. And if you target
    them, they get angry and they say, “Hey, it's too much marketing – too much of
    this bullshit. I don't want this. Goodbye.” And they just stop working with you.
    For this problem, predicting the probability of the outcome is not enough. Because
    we might predict that there is something like a 60% probability that this person
    will convert (they will buy from us) but now we don't know if they will buy if
    we target them or if we don't target them – or maybe their probability will actually
    drop if we target them. For this, we need to model something that is called “counterfactuals”.
    We need to model how they behave under the campaign and under no campaign. Then,
    by comparing these two outcomes, we can make a decision.
  sec: 936
  time: '15:36'
  who: Aleksander
- header: Counterfactuals and and Judea Pearl
- line: Counterfactual? What does it mean, exactly, in broader terms? It's a complex
    word.
  sec: 1095
  time: '18:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. “Factual” means something that actually happens in the world. And the
    “counterfactual” means something that is not happening in the world, so we change
    something. In Pearlian language –  Pearlian comes from Judea Pearl, who is a computer
    scientist, who is the Godfather or even a father of modern causality (or graph-based
    causality) – in these terms, this means that we perform in a minimal intervention,
    as they call it, in the world. For instance, you have a red shirt today, a red
    t-shirt, maybe. I'm picking certain examples when you ask me and we could ask
    the question, “Would I pick different examples if you wore a blue shirt? Would
    that prime me somehow differently?” Now, if we have a very rich causal model,
    we could answer this question. This is not always very simple, but at least theoretically,
    it's possible.
  sec: 1102
  time: '18:22'
  who: Aleksander
- line: But we don't know what would happen if I wore a blue t-shirt, right? That's
    why it's contrafactual. We don't know what would happen “if”.
  sec: 1170
  time: '19:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. We will never observe it, moreover. We will never observe you in the
    same situation – you and me in the same situation – and you wearing a blue t-shirt
    instead of a red t-shirt.
  sec: 1179
  time: '19:39'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So the other example you gave earlier was... Let's say we targeted somebody
    and we saw how they reacted to the advertisement, but we don't know how they would
    have reacted had we not target them, right?
  sec: 1191
  time: '19:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Another example could be, let's say we have a recommender system and we show
    certain items. But there are other items we don't show. Maybe if we showed other
    items, they would have clicked, right? But they did not because we did not show
    them – and we have no idea what would have happened if we did that thing?
  sec: 1209
  time: '20:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. That's an amazing example. Recommender systems – it's the same,
    yeah. It's the same structure as you noticed.
  sec: 1230
  time: '20:30'
  who: Aleksander
- header: Meta-learners vs classical ML models
- line: So I guess our typical “classical” models like logistic regression, decision
    trees, XGBoost, whatever, classical neural networks – they do not really cover
    these cases, right? We don't know. In the example of targeting somebody, all we
    know is how people reacted to a campaign. We don't know how people who weren't
    targeted would have reacted. So what kind of models do we need to use to model
    this specific case?
  sec: 1244
  time: '20:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a great question. You are correct. Out of the box, supervised models
    do not have the capabilities to reason causally and there are many different types
    of causal models. But the one that I think is relatively the easiest to to grasp,
    and that also, behind the scenes, uses traditional machine learning models, is
    a family of models called meta-learners. The name is maybe a little bit unfortunate,
    because we also have meta-learners in traditional non-causal machine learning.
  sec: 1282
  time: '21:22'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Like Ensemble learners? Is it the same thing?
  sec: 1324
  time: '22:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. No, I think it's slightly different. But anyway, causal meta-learners
    are called meta-learners for a very particular reason – because they take regular
    machine learning models and they use them to produce those counterfactual worlds.
    Of course, they're estimated counterfactual worlds. Probably the easiest example
    of a meta-learner is a very simple meta-learner called T-learner. T-learner stands
    for two-learner because it uses two machine learning models. It uses one machine
    learning model to learn the response function for under no treatment.
  sec: 1327
  time: '22:07'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Let's assume that the treatment is binary, so we do something or we don't
    do it. And the second model is used to learn the response function, which means
    mapping from the treatment and maybe some features to the outcome. It learns the
    response function and the treatment. So we have one model that learns response
    function under no treatment and another one under the treatment.
  sec: 1327
  time: '22:07'
  who: Aleksander
- line: I just want to make sure I understand. We have two models – for the first
    model, let's say we're talking about this campaign example, when we targeted people
    with an advertisement. We have this pool of people who we target – our audience.
    We send them some sort of campaign and we collect the data. We know who opened
    the email, who ended up clicking it and we know who did not do this.
  sec: 1407
  time: '23:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: We have this dataset with the target variable. But then we also have other
    people to whom we did not send the campaign. We can observe what they do on the
    platform. We know that we did not send to this pool of people but they still may
    buy the thing we're advertising. So we just take all the other people and see
    who actually bought this thing in the end. And then we have two models.
  sec: 1407
  time: '23:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so we take these two groups of people – one that we sent the campaign
    to and the other one that didn't receive the campaign – and we train one model
    on one group, another model on another group. Now, you also said about clicking
    emails and so on, so there is compliance, which means that if somebody clicked
    on something, etc. – it makes the thing a little bit more complex. Let's put it
    aside for now and let's just focus on those two models. So we take those two models,
    and then for any new observation, we make predictions using both models. It only
    makes sense if we also have some features that describe our population.
  sec: 1464
  time: '24:24'
  who: Aleksander
- line: For each individual, we make a prediction using the “treatment” model and
    the “non-treatment” model. We take the outcomes from both models and we subtract
    the outcome from the non-treated model, from the treated model, and this gives
    us a quantity that is called a “conditional average treatment effect”. This outcome
    can be interpreted as a conditional average treatment effect only under certain
    circumstances, which means that the original data that we trained the model on
    has to be unconfounded (which means that there is no causal bias in this data)
    and this might be accomplished in two ways – either by randomizing the treatment
    in the training data, which means that we basically perform an experiment or...
  sec: 1464
  time: '24:24'
  who: Aleksander
- line: In the same way as an A/B test, right?
  sec: 1576
  time: '26:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, yes. It will be like a well-designed A/B test. Or the second option is
    to perform causal feature selection, which might be a little bit more difficult
    because we need to observe all the variables that can have impact on the treatment
    and the outcome at the same time and we need to exclude certain other variables
    that might have certain structural relation to other variables in the model. Basically,
    there are these two ways to do it.
  sec: 1577
  time: '26:17'
  who: Aleksander
- line: What do we do with the results? We subtract one from the other, we get some
    quantity so I guess there could be three possibilities, like negative, zero, and
    positive. Right? [Aleksander agrees] What do we do in each of these cases?
  sec: 1608
  time: '26:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, it all depends on the setting. If we just say that the outcome is binary
    – they either buy or they do not buy. Negative, as I understand it, will be if
    somebody would have bought unless we'd targeted him. If you want to make an optimal
    decision from your budget allocation point of view, you should only treat people
    who would buy if targeted – that will be an optimal decision for you.
  sec: 1625
  time: '27:05'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So only if it's positive, right?
  sec: 1661
  time: '27:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Only if it's positive and if it would be positive and if it would be negative
    otherwise.
  sec: 1663
  time: '27:43'
  who: Aleksander
- header: Average treatment effect
- line: Okay. Can you explain again? [chuckles]
  sec: 1672
  time: '27:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] I think we had different understanding, so let me expand on this.
    We should only target people who are positive under the treatment model and negative
    or zero in the non-treatment model. If we apply this ATE (average treatment effect)
    formula, that would be one minus zero, which means one – their outcome is one.'
  sec: 1673
  time: '27:53'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Okay. So the treatment model predicts that this person would buy, the non-treatment
    model predicts that this person would not buy – in this case, we go ahead and
    target. [Aleksander agrees] In other cases, we do not.
  sec: 1700
  time: '28:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, in other cases we do not, because people who would buy under no treatment
    and treatment – it doesn't make sense to target them because it makes no difference
    to them based on our estimation, of course. We don't target people who don't buy
    anyway because it seems that it doesn't matter to them as well. And of course,
    we don't want to target people who are buying under no treatment and stop buying
    under treatments, because this is just generating a loss on both ends for us –
    losing a client and actually paying to lose a client. It's like paying to lose
    a client.
  sec: 1715
  time: '28:35'
  who: Aleksander
- header: Reducing causal bias, the super efficient estimator, and model uplifting
- line: It's like the worst possible thing. [Aleksander agrees] You spent money but
    you also lost the client. I imagine it can introduce some problems. Let's say
    we take this model, deploy it, apply to the entire population (to all our customers)
    and start using it. We continue collecting data. The data we collect might be...
    We applied the model and now we introduce some bias by starting to apply this
    model. Should we maybe always do some sort of randomized test trial when we deploy
    this model? Or is it okay to go ahead and apply to everyone?
  sec: 1757
  time: '29:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is a great question. The short answer is that if you use a model like
    T-learner, you might have certain problems. For instance, you can show that those
    simple meta-learners will have a little bit of estimation bias, which is different
    from causal bias. We assume that causally we are okay – our data was either randomized
    or structurally, the variables were chosen in a causally meaningful way. Then
    we still might have some estimation bias from those models. There are different
    models (other models) like double machine learning, for instance, that are trying
    to remove this estimation bias from those models.

  who: Aleksander
- line: Just last week, I think Lasso Lars published another paper where he introduced
    triple machine learning, which uses another piece of statistical information,
    let's say, to debias the model. He achieved something that is called a super efficient
    estimator, which means that it converges to the true value much faster with the
    sample size than a traditional estimator. So this is one thing. But I think what
    is more important is that sometimes it might be difficult for us to also get rid
    of this causal bias.
  sec: 1803
  time: '30:03'
  who: Aleksander
- line: In this sense, if we are not sure that we were able to get rid of the causal
    bias, it will definitely be good practice – before the ultimate deployment – to
    deploy this model to have part of your customer base, if that's possible. This
    is something that I usually recommend to my clients – that we deploy a model to
    a part of the customer base and we always compare it to the baseline (whatever
    our baseline is). The baseline might be just a simple machine learning predictive
    model.
  sec: 1803
  time: '30:03'
  who: Aleksander
- line: In this case, “compare” means we compare using some sort of business metric,
    like what the revenue that these two groups brought is, right?
  sec: 1951
  time: '32:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we basically evaluate the policy. We can think about a causal model
    like this – this is often called “uplift modeling”. “Uplift” because we change
    whatever metric goes up when we use this causal modeling technique. So yeah, this
    is evaluating based on whatever metric matters to us. This might be revenue, this
    might be churn, this might be anything that would be relevant.

- header: Metrics for evaluating a causal model vs a traditional ML model
- line: There is a question from Taras. Taras is asking, “How do we estimate the quality
    of a causal model if the metrics that we use are the same as for plain regression
    (traditional ML models}? Or are the metrics different?”
  sec: 1994
  time: '33:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let's unpack this question. There are a couple of levels of evaluation of
    causal models. So the first one is regarding causal unbiasedness. Is there a causal
    bias in our dataset? Here, “traditional machine learning metrics,” or “traditional
    machine learning evaluation approaches,” like cross-validation, for instance,
    are not really useful. Why? Because the observational distribution (associational
    distribution) we can get the same  associational distribution from different interventional
    distributions or different counterfactual distributions. This means that we can
    have different data-generating processes that end up giving us exactly the same
    observational distribution. So this is not very useful and we need other stuff
    to make sure that it works. One of the ideas that we can use is actually what
    we just discussed – deploying the model and looking at how it works.
  sec: 2013
  time: '33:33'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Another way is using so-called “refutation tests”. So refutation tests try
    to falsify the causal structure within the model, which means these tests usually
    are changing something in the data, for instance, and they check if the causal
    coefficient that we are finding is also changing or not. This is a scientific
    method – Paparian scientific methodology. We're trying to change something in
    the world and we say, “Hey, if this model will react to this in a certain way,
    it means that it's almost certainly wrong.” Those tests cannot confirm that the
    model is correct, but they can falsify the hypothesis that the model is correct.
    Then we have statistical estimates. The question from Taras was, if I remember
    correctly, “If we use the same set of metrics for both models...” Yeah, we can
    do [that].
  sec: 2013
  time: '33:33'
  who: Aleksander
- line: If we want to evaluate the policy, which means – if we want to evaluate whether
    we make better decisions based on a causal model versus on a non-causal model,
    then we definitely should use the same metric. Because if we use different metrics,
    then we are not comparing apples to apples. There's also a third dimension, which
    is the quality of the estimator itself. Assuming that the cover part is okay –
    we don't have any causal bias in the model – we might be also interested in (we
    should be interested in) seeing what the quality of estimation of statistical
    parameters within the causal structure is. And here, things like cross-validation
    and all those traditional metrics can be helpful because now we assume that we
    split the dataset into the training and test part.
  sec: 2013
  time: '33:33'
  who: Aleksander
- line: We assume that they are IID. And we just want to see how well our estimators
    are estimating model parameters in the model based on the performance on the test
    set while the model was trained on the train set. In my book, you will find multiple
    examples of these procedures.
  sec: 2013
  time: '33:33'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Yeah, I was going to ask about your book. Because to me, it sounded quite
    abstract. In general, metrics is such a topic that, for me personally, without
    examples and illustrations and actually going and trying to implement these things,
    play with them – they are just too abstract. What you're saying is that if somebody
    felt lost during this description, or wants to learn more about that, they should
    check out your book. Right? There, you describe in more detail all these things
    that you just talked about?
  sec: 2257
  time: '37:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, definitely. In the book, we actually go almost from scratch. We start
    by talking about basic fundamental causal concepts and then we move gradually,
    step by step, towards machine learning methods, heterogeneous treatment effect
    estimation (which is another name for uplift modeling, let's say, plus or minus
    – this terminology is maybe not always consistent). Then we also talk about another
    topic, which is called “causal discovery,” when we are trying to discover causal
    structure within our dataset from observational data, or observational and interventional
    data.

  who: Aleksander
- header: Is the added complexity of a causal model worth implementing?
- line: From what I understood, these causal models are pretty useful and we should
    use them when possible (when needed) but they introduce an extra layer of complexity.
    Right? Right now, let's say you have a traditional model – you have just one model
    – you deploy it, you use it, and it seems to be working fine. But then if you
    start thinking about causality and causal models, then in the simplest case, you
    at least have two models.
  sec: 2334
  time: '38:54'
  who: Alexey

    Is it always worth it to introduce this complexity? Or maybe there are cases when
    we shouldn't worry about causality yet and postpone this to some later point?
  sec: 2334
  time: '38:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Great question. Great question and a very loaded question. So starting from,
    “Is it worth it?” As to this question, it depends on what you are trying to achieve.
    If you're only interested in predicting something, and you say, “Hey, this is
    an IID case and I just want to predict if this will be more than five or less
    than five.” Then there is no need for causal models. Because causal models...

    We're not interested in...”
  sec: 2417

    bets on reality based on a single model prediction.
  sec: 2424
  time: '40:24'
  who: Aleksander
- line: But don't we always...? In most cases, we have a machine learning model to
    make a decision – to act on this decision. “Should we give money or should we
    not give money to a prospective client?” “Should we target somebody or should
    we not target?” In most cases, for classification, we want to make a decision.
    Right? “Should we put this email in spam or not spam?” “Should we write a recommender
    system? Should we display it or should we not display it?” In most of these cases
    there is a decision.
  sec: 2432
  time: '40:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Always, when there is a decision and you also have some treatment that
    is under your control (which means that you can change something in the world)
    there is a potential of benefit for you in using causal models. But you asked
    me if it's worth it. I'm smiling because just two weeks ago, I got a message from
    my colleague, and he told me, “Hey, in my company, I just started analyzing the
    machine learning model that the whole marketing in the company is based on and
    I just discovered that for three years, we just have losses on our marketing.”
    This is making decisions based on the machine learning model. And it works. It's
    easy, because it's just one model – maybe. Probably they have more, but it's relatively
    easy. And everybody's happy.
  sec: 2474
  time: '41:14'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Then somebody comes and they do the math and it seems that the marketing is
    actually throwing money away. And then he started analyzing this. He sent me a
    screenshot of his like, “Hey, this is my causal model and how it works. What do
    you think about it?” Every time you have this kind of a problem, I think it's
    worth it to go into causal models. Now, there is a psychological block, I suppose,
    in some people because they think, “Hey, we have some status quo. It works. I
    don't know, maybe even how it works, but it seems it's okay. We are alive. We
    are moving forward. So maybe, let's not touch it.” But then it depends – it depends,
    again, on what your goals are. What are your long-term goals? If you really want
    to maximize your gains and minimize losses in the long run, maybe it's worth it
    to just stop for a while and say, “Okay, let's see how it works. Let's see how
    much the investment today is and then what we can expect in the future?”
  sec: 2474
  time: '41:14'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So we should think. Right? [chuckles] I think one of the things you mentioned
    previously is – when we deploy a causal model, typically there is a baseline.
    It's always a good idea to compare this causal model to the baseline. This is
    the data-driven way to see if adding one extra layer of complexity is actually
    worth it. Right?
  sec: 2605
  time: '43:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely. I think even if you feel internally convinced that your data is
    causally unbiased, I would always recommend this. Because sometimes we just cannot
    think about something. There's maybe a little thing we missed. I think it's always
    an incremental work, really, to make things better and so on. But I think this
    is the same in life and in business.

- header: Utilizing LLMs in causal models (text as outcome)
- line: There is one quite hot topic these days – these LLMs. Everyone is talking
    about LLMs – natural language models. In our podcasts, we were actually pretty
    late to the party. But recently, we had two podcast interviews that were about
    our LLMs. So better late than never. I guess LLMs are kind of hot because of ChatGPT.
    At least this is when I noticed them. Before, when it was just GPT-3, it was like,
    “Okay, so what?” But when I saw ChatGPT, it completely changed my perception of
    what these models could do. You recently gave a talk (I don't know how recently,
    but you did at some point give a talk) about causality and NLP and you tested
    LLMs with causal questions. Can you tell us more about this talk? Can you summarize
    it for us?
  sec: 2666
  time: '44:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. Since this talk, a lot has changed in the research community and
    also, in the LLM space something has changed so... I will give you a summary of
    the talk and then also a short summary of where we are today. In the talk, we
    discuss the idea of combining natural language processing with causality, in particular,
    large language models with causality. There are a couple of ways that you can
    think about the intersection of those two areas. One is about using language models
    as elements of a causal system, perhaps as some kind of a feature extractor –
    in the role of feature extractors.
  sec: 2721
  time: '45:21'
  who: Aleksander
- line: To me it's a bit abstract.
  sec: 2777
  time: '46:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Okay, so let's think about a more concrete example. Maybe we have a
    situation where we have a program that aims to help people write more clearly.
    There's maybe a one-week or two-week workshop – people are sitting, writing, learning
    how to write more clearly, and so on and so on.
  sec: 2779
  time: '46:19'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Without LLMs – just a workshop.
  sec: 2810
  time: '46:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Just people.
  sec: 2813
  time: '46:53'
  who: Aleksander
- line: There's a teacher. They learn and then, as the outcome of this workshop, they
    walk out knowing how to create a better copy – create a better article.
  sec: 2814
  time: '46:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Now, we might be interested in evaluating if this workshop worked. So
    if they are writing more clearly, really. If you want to do it at scale, it's
    challenging to engage (to hire) many people that will do the evaluation for us
    because they will need to read many pages of text, and so on, and so on. So we
    could potentially use an LLM (large language model) here and ask it for the clarity
    score for those essays. Then we could say – if we randomized the treatment, where
    some people got to the workshop and others did not based on a random assignment
    – we could basically compute the average treatment effect. So that's one way.
    This scenario is sometimes called “text as an outcome,” because the text is the
    outcome of some experiment. It also may be “text as a mediator,” which means that
    we have some treatment, then there's text produced and caused by this treatment
    (or some aspect of this text is caused by this treatment) and then we have some
    other outcome.
  sec: 2823
  time: '47:03'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So if I understood correctly – there are two groups of people. One is the
    treatment group – people who went through the workshop. The other group is people
    who did not go through the workshop. Then each person in these two groups produces
    some text and then for each of the texts, we ask an LLM, “Hey, what's the clarity
    score?” And then we just compare  using some sort of T-test or whatever, to see
    whether the workshop was actually helpful. Right?
  sec: 2902
  time: '48:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. That would be an example of the scenario that is called “text
    as an outcome,” because the text is the outcome where we expect some change (some
    difference).
  sec: 2938
  time: '48:58'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Okay. So what's wrong with that?
  sec: 2950
  time: '49:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sorry?
  sec: 2954
  time: '49:14'
  who: Aleksander
- line: What's wrong with that? Sounds like a good approach. [chuckles]
  sec: 2955
  time: '49:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, this is a good approach. Now we are talking about a scenario where we
    are using LLMs as an element – as an decoder or encoder within a system. We know
    that the system is causal. We know the causal structure of the system, and then
    the LLM is just one of the elements within the system that helps us turn this
    multi-dimensional entity that a text is, into some numerical summary. We can also
    use it in another way – maybe “text as a confounder,” which means that we have
    some treatment and we have some outcome and some aspect of the text is affecting
    both the treatment and the outcome. This is interesting because sometimes it's
    difficult to actually say, “Hey, this is one outcome. There's just one thing in
    the text that is influencing something. How do we extract this information?” Maybe
    its style. It's very difficult to quantify style and large language models can
    be helpful with this. Let me give you another example with text as treatment.
    So maybe we have a copy.
  sec: 2957
  time: '49:17'
  who: Aleksander
- header: Text as treatment and style extraction
- line: Do you mean “text as confounder” or “text as treatment”?
  sec: 3045
  time: '50:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: It will be text as treatment. I think it will be...
  sec: 3047
  time: '50:47'
  who: Aleksander
- line: It's the same as previously, right?
  sec: 3049
  time: '50:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, previously it was text as outcome and now it's text as treatment. So maybe
    we have a marketing copy and we have a bunch of people receiving this copy. And
    there's another version of this copy and another bunch of people are receiving
    this copy. Then we want to compare if they bought or they subscribed for DataTalk.Club.
    And maybe the copies are different. They have the same semantics – they're talking
    about the same stuff, but they just have a different style. Maybe just one is
    just like more...
  sec: 3051
  time: '50:51'
  who: Aleksander
- line: I've just thought of an example. Usually, we have a newsletter for DataTalks.Club
    that has a sponsored slot –  a sponsored block. Usually our sponsors give us some
    text but then what we do is look at this text and say, “Hey, we don't think this
    way of speaking will appeal to our community. Let's rewrite it right.” Usually,
    the marketing department gives us the copy and we rewrite it slightly so it doesn't
    have these words that marketing people use, because they're a turn-off for engineers.
  sec: 3091
  time: '51:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: So in this case, we rework the copy, and then we include it in the newsletter.
    But maybe what we should do is take the original one, take the reworked one, and
    test which one is better. Right? Because right now, it's just our gut feeling
    that the engineers (our community members) like the reworked version more than
    the original one. But it's just some gut feeling. We did not actually evaluate
    it.
  sec: 3091
  time: '51:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That's a great scenario for an A/B test. Yeah.
  sec: 3152
  time: '52:32'
  who: Aleksander
- line: But in this case, it's people who do this. But if we're talking about an LLM,
    it could be like, “Okay, there is a copy that a sponsor gives us and then there
    is an LLM that rewrites this.” Right?
  sec: 3157
  time: '52:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: There could be an element that rewrites this. There could also be, if you
    take many different copies that are written in style A and some in style B, the
    LLM would be able to maybe extract the style property. Because the embeddings
    in the embedding space could be encoded in a certain way that could be useful.
  sec: 3169
  time: '52:49'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Style can be something like “marketing language” or “engineering language,”
    right?
  sec: 3195
  time: '53:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: For instance, yeah.
  sec: 3202
  time: '53:22'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Formal, informal, right?
  sec: 3203
  time: '53:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Formal, informal – yeah.
  sec: 3204
  time: '53:24'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Instead of people going through this and saying, “Okay, maybe this text was
    written by data scientists, this text was written by a marketing person.” Instead
    of a person going through this, we can ask them an LLM to say what kind of style
    it is. Right?
  sec: 3206
  time: '53:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we could do this. We could also use it just to classify the style. Yes.
    So that's one way of thinking about this. We can have this text as treatment,
    as outcome, as a confounder, as a covariate, and so on. We could also imagine
    a situation – just to give you one more example – where we're interested in let's
    say whether gender predicts the popularity of your posts on social media. Gender
    is unobserved, but you have some description and we can assume that gender influences
    the style of your description. But it's very...
  sec: 3223
  time: '53:43'
  who: Aleksander
- line: What do we mean by gender in this case? If text was written by a male or a
    female?
  sec: 3274
  time: '54:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Male or female, whatever person identifies as. We might be interested
    in a hypothesis like this. You can observe a phenomenon like this in scientific
    citations as well. For for instance, it seems that from the observational point
    of view, female researchers are just getting less citations than male researchers.
    And it seems that this effect is stronger when those female researchers can be
    identified easily as female researchers – maybe there is a full name in the abstract
    and this full name suggests to another person that this person is female. In the
    Western culture, if somebody is called Stephanie, for instance, most people would
    assume that this person is female.
  sec: 3278
  time: '54:38'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So we might be interested if gender influences the number of citations or
    the popularity of a post on LinkedIn, but it might be the case that the gender
    is unobserved, but there is a style of text for instance that is influenced by
    gender. To what extent is this realistic? Probably in certain circumstances more
    and in certain circumstances less, but this is just an example. Then, this text
    style – or the way that gender manifests itself in the text – is very hard to
    capture. Now, if we use an LLM – and in particular, we this fine-tune this model
    on this core task – then we can assume that it will learn the important characteristics
    of how gender relates to the style of text, even if gender is unobserved and then
    we can do causal reasoning on this system. An LLM in this situation is just like
    a very fancy feature extractor. So it extracts from the text anything that was
    related to the gender.
  sec: 3278
  time: '54:38'
  who: Aleksander
- line: So in this case, there's a variable that we do not observe and typically what
    we would do without an LLM would be to build a model for extracting style, right?
    We would collect training examples, we would label them, we'd train a model with
    an LLM (just take GPT-4 or whatever). With the instructions, we can use it to
    extract these things. This is what we do. We extract the variable that we do not
    observe.
  sec: 3417
  time: '56:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, we could try an approach like this. The problem here is also that the
    gender is unobserved. Then it might be complicated to label this in an automated
    manner.
  sec: 3450

  who: Aleksander

    tip. In the library that we use, there was a bug in the code and I changed the
    implementation right before the presentation. So if you want the code that works
    properly, you can go to my book's repository and look for “CausalBert” and there's

    methods can be leveraged?” The first part of this question is “Are there cases
    when we can't use an A/B test?” I imagine that there are. In this case, “How exactly
    do we approach this situation?”

  who: Alexey
- line: Great question. Yes, there are cases where using A/B tests might be difficult
    for ethical, financial, or whatever technical reasons. If we can use causal machine
    learning in those cases, the short answer is yes. A longer answer is – it really
    depends to what extent you are able to fulfill causal assumptions. We didn't discuss
    this too much, but in order to make a causal model causally unbiased, we need
    to fulfill certain assumptions regarding which variables are observed. If we have
    some variables that are unobserved, we might use certain methods for something
    that is called “partial identification,” or we can perform things like causal
    sensitivity analysis and so on. And we might still get useful information out
    of those models, even if we cannot get a precise point estimate or precise confidence
    intervals. So the short answer is yes. The longer answer is, “in certain cases,
    when you cannot observe certain variables, this might be a little bit more difficult.”

  who: Aleksander
- line: In certain cases, it might also be impossible. But I think a great power of
    causal thinking, if you understand how those graphical structures relate to the
    problem of estimation and so on, is that you can very clearly state your problem
    and understand to what extent this problem is solvable. If you just drop a machine
    learning algorithm on your problem, you will get some answer. But if you don't
    analyze this problem in advance, you might not really know or understand fully
    what this answer is and to what extent it's useful for decision making.
  sec: 3596
  time: '59:56'
  who: Aleksander
- line: Thinking causally gives a lot of clarity in this regard, especially – in particular,
    I'm talking about graphical models, or structural causal models that Judea Pearl
    proposed – I think that's a great tool for clarity. So even for people who are
    not planning to use causal inference or causal reasoning in their business problems
    directly today, the idea of understanding this is something that can give them
    long-term and very, very pronounced benefits.

  who: Aleksander
- header: Graphical structures and nonparametric identification
- line: You mentioned one thing here in your answer – you mentioned graphical structures.
    In the previous part, when we talked about LLMs, you mentioned an architecture.
    I guess in both cases, you mean a way of designing a model in such a way that
    it's clear which thing causes which, and then you have this causality chain or
    whatever. We probably don't have time to go into this but your book, I assume,
    covers this in more detail. Right?
  sec: 3758
  time: '1:02:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, my book definitely covers this and your intuition is absolutely correct.
    Graphical model encodes the causal structure between variables. Let me take a
    step back and let's very briefly discuss the Pearlian definition of causality.
    The basic Pearlian definition of causality is, “A causes B, if B 'listens' to
    A.” “Listens to” means that if we change something in A, we expect to also see
    a change in B. We could have a deeper discussion on this, but I'm sure this is
    not for this format.
  sec: 3789
  time: '1:03:09'
  who: Aleksander
- line: One of the examples you gave was about temperature, ice cream sales, and the
    number of people who drowned, right? [Aleksander agrees] Here if we change the
    temperature, then both these variables will change as well.
  sec: 3830
  time: '1:03:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's what we would expect, yeah. On average. Of course, there are people
    who are drowning in winter and eating ice cream in winter, but in a statistical
    sense, we would expect that it's reasonable that they also go down. And then we
    express it in a graphical form, saying, “Hey, this is temperature and there's
    an arrow to ice cream sales and there's an arrow to the number of drownings.”
    And the interesting fact is that those graphical structures have certain properties,
    where we can identify causal structures without even looking at the data. So if
    we know the core structure itself, but we don't know anything about the data,
    we can already say something about the system.
  sec: 3843
  time: '1:04:03'
  who: Aleksander
- line: This is sometimes called nonparametric identification. Based on a structure
    like this, we can say, “We actually don't need to observe this very costly variable
    and this one as well. It's sufficient that we just observe these three variables.
    And if we have these three variables, we can build a causally unbiased model.”
    And this is a great tool because some organizations that treat the data stuff
    very seriously tend to invest a lot of money in observing as much stuff as possible.
    And sometimes, some of those variables might not be very helpful in answering
    their most pressing questions. Yeah,

  who: Aleksander
- line: Okay. Thank you. I guess the to-go reference for everything we discussed today
    would be your book. Then, also the talk that you gave at Berlin PyData, which
    I missed. I was at the conference.

  who: Alexey

  who: Alexey
- header: Aleksander's resource recommendations
- line: Can you recommend any other resources [besides your book] for people who want
    to learn more about the topic? I guess one of the things you mentioned was Judea
    Pearl's book?
  sec: 3967
  time: '1:06:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. If you're just starting, it's called the Book of Why. That's a great
    book for a starter. It's a great book if you're just starting and then if you
    want to go into more practical stuff, especially in Python, there's my book called
    Causal Inference and Discovery in Python. It also goes almost from scratch. I
    wrote it for people who have like 3–5 years of experience in machine learning
    and they want to learn about causality. But the Book of Why will also give you
    a lot of very, very nice motivation, beautiful examples from the history of science,
    how non-causal thinking failed, and how thanks to global thinking people were
    able to solve problems.
