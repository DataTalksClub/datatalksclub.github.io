short: Hiring Data Science Talent
title: Hiring Data Science Talent
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about hiring data scientists. We have a special yesterday,
    Olga. Olga is a delivery director – a delivery data science director at Microsoft.
    Olga has worked in AI for over 16 years. She has worked in different roles, from
    researcher to product manager to people manager. As a director, she's quite involved
    in hiring data scientists, so we invited her to talk more about this. Welcome.
  sec: 104
  time: '1:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you very much for having me.
  sec: 134
  time: '2:14'
  who: Olga
- header: Olga’s career journey
- line: Before we go into our main topic of hiring data scientists, let's start with
    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 137
  time: '2:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. I started really early with what you would refer to as data science.
    I was about 18 when I was studying at the university, and I was studying Applied
    Mathematics. And then out of all the subjects mathematics, statistics was basically
    the one that got me fascinated right away, because it made sense. It was something
    that was one of the most tangible. Then I discovered a lot of uses for statistics.
    I was also very, very lucky to have great lecturers and great professors along
    the way. So I think it's also important to have great teachers in your life. I
    was really lucky. And then I kind of stuck with this since then.
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Olga
- line: My first job was in 2006. I was working for a small consulting company – a
    boutique consulting company – doing forecasting of box office revenues of motion
    pictures. I think the model, or at least the approach, definitely evolved. But
    I think the approach is still in use by the subsequent derivation of that company
    today. Then I worked for a mogul in telecommunications doing the very classical
    use case template in communication, which is called churn prediction. Then I decided
    to pursue my BA – no, first, I think it was my Master’s, and then it was my PhD.
    All of the stuff that I've done was also kind of applied statistics, machine learning.
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Olga
- line: Then I worked in a bunch of places – five different countries, startup setting,
    freelance, more consulting. Now it's a very large, (I think the best in the world)
    software company. [chuckles]
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Olga
- line: Nameless company. [chuckles]
  sec: 255
  time: '4:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think I have always done things which have to do with financial services,
    mostly – or health. Basically, if you put them together, it's well-being with
    a small exception where I spent two and a half years working for an airline. It
    was a very romantic time. I was living in the airport. It was incredible. I do
    not regret it in the slightest. It was really kind of a separate experience. It
    was really great.
  sec: 257
  time: '4:17'
  who: Olga
- line: What did you do there? Also related to data science forecasting or something
    else?
  sec: 288
  time: '4:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's a German airline, which you might know. Yeah. [chuckles] I was
    working there, first as the lead data scientist and then I worked there, basically,
    not as part of the airline, but in a consulting company, which was working with
    the airlines that was devoted to it. I was leading AI projects, initiatives, and
    helping create personalized flight experiences.
  sec: 292
  time: '4:52'
  who: Olga
- line: So you did the PhD, you worked in a startup, then you freelanced, then you
    joined the consultancy company, and now you work in a corporation. It’s like you
    tried everything, right?
  sec: 320
  time: '5:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: I also did a postdoc. It was also always a dream of mine. It's something that
    many PhDs want to do. Sometimes they want to do it for reasons that they cannot
    explain to themselves. Alexey, I also told you, I think, while we were talking
    about preparation of the schools, one of the podcasts that you have made really
    moved me and motivated me to speak, which was about the transition from academia
    to industry.
  sec: 333
  time: '5:33'
  who: Olga
- line: This is also a story of my life as well as many other lives. This is why,
    if you have done a PhD, you want to do a postdoc. You consider this and you do
    not really know why. You just want it and you go for it. So it was the story of
    my life. I don't regret it in the slightest. I'm still friends with all the people
    I used to work with. Yeah, it was a fantastic experience.
  sec: 333
  time: '5:33'
  who: Olga
- line: By the way, check out this episode that Olga was talking about. I think I
    was talking with CJ Jenkins. It was called “From Academia to Data Science”. I
    think it was a couple of seasons ago, check it out. That was indeed the cool one.
    Olga, what was your PhD about?
  sec: 385
  time: '6:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was about the application of machine learning to assess air pollution.
    It was in the metropolitan region of Barcelona, precisely. This is important,
    because you could have many diseases that could be linked to certain levels of
    air pollution. They're not directly related, but they could be potentially linked.
    I think it's a little bit common sense that if you have highly polluted areas,
    the propensity of somebody getting an ailment is higher.
  sec: 408
  time: '6:48'
  who: Olga
- line: The idea was to create a measurement method to be able to come up with a pollution
    surface, to be able to precisely estimate the level of air pollution at a given
    point and thus be able to say what would have been the estimate of air pollution
    of a certain place. And the strength of this was one of the interesting methods,
    which is called conformal predictions. Instead of giving you a point estimate,
    it would give you an interval, but it will be a very valid and very reliable estimate.
    The more data you have, obviously, the narrower your interval is.
  sec: 408
  time: '6:48'
  who: Olga
- line: Was it something related to Bayesian statistics, where you get a distribution…
    [cross-talk]
  sec: 489
  time: '8:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: You could do that as well, but not necessarily. Yes, there were some parts
    of underlying methods that use Bayesian inference – so I haven't used the word
    in 75 years. But it was frequentist as well, so it didn't really have to be.
  sec: 493
  time: '8:13'
  who: Olga
- line: Okay. And what do you do now? If you can tell us.
  sec: 510
  time: '8:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: What do I do now? I lead a team of people who are much smarter than I am –
    much more intelligent and much more advanced in modern technologies, in modern
    data science, they’re much better versed. So I try to support them on their way
    towards supporting our customers and making a positive impact, especially a positive
    business impact, working with our customers. I mean, the customers of Microsoft
    are obviously very important. We also work…
  sec: 514
  time: '8:34'
  who: Olga
- line: I'm kind of on this podcast today as myself, not as a representation of my
    company. So everything I say, I have to say that this is my own opinion, and does
    not necessarily reflect or does not necessarily somehow match the opinion of my
    employer. But I'm very proud to work there, I have to say. I mean, our motto is
    to empower every person or organization on the planet to achieve more. And I'm
    just fascinated by how we work with different sizes of organizations from moguls,
    corporations, Forbes’ 500 list of companies, up to startups, essentially.
  sec: 514
  time: '8:34'
  who: Olga
- line: I have people in my team, me included – but I don't really spend enough time
    on this as much as I would want – to support startup founders and also female
    founders. We have a program, which is called Microsoft for Startups. This is also
    something which is quite cool. But going back to what I do, as well, essentially
    it’s supporting my team in driving the best and the most meaningful business outcomes
    for our customers with data science. I'm also responsible for business development
    in specific regions in EMEA, and to help drive technology innovation, essentially.
    And to do the right thing with AI.
  sec: 514
  time: '8:34'
  who: Olga
- header: Hiring data scientists now vs 7 years ago
- line: And, as I mentioned, you're involved in hiring, right? That's why we’re having
    this conversation today.
  sec: 638
  time: '10:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, actually, I have been involved in hiring for the last seven years, I
    would say. I’ve been hiring data scientists for about seven years’ time. It has
    not been a small journey, really.
  sec: 644
  time: '10:44'
  who: Olga
- line: Since you mentioned that, I'm really curious how the definition of a data
    scientist changed over these seven years. Was it the same seven years ago? Or
    now the data scientists you hire are completely different from the data scientists
    you hired seven years ago?
  sec: 660
  time: '11:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends, Alexey. Because if you hire senior people, they are the people
    from before. I think they are mammoths, like you and I, [Alexey laughs] who started
    studying when there was no such thing as data science. So my newest hire, they
    graduated from data science programs which are formally called Data Science Programs.
    When I started, there was no such thing. I studied applied statistics, you know?
    What did you study, by the way?
  sec: 676
  time: '11:16'
  who: Olga
- line: Information technologies.
  sec: 701
  time: '11:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: You see? So there are so many different walks of life from where people come
    to become data scientists. Physics, all flavors of engineering, neuroscience –
    social sciences as well. I think that sometime, so basically seven years ago,
    there were a little bit less expectations, let's put it that way – less expectations
    around what a data scientist would do. But I guess what has stayed in the variant
    is pursuit of excellence, to be honest. Because a great data scientist back then
    is still a great scientist now. You could have been excellent seven years ago,
    and you could be excellent now, if that makes sense.
  sec: 704
  time: '11:44'
  who: Olga
- line: The thing I observed – maybe it's just that my sample size is a bit biased
    – but what I saw is that now there is more emphasis on the engineering aspect
    of data science. And seven, eight years ago, the focus was more on mathematics
    and the mathematics behind machine learning. This is at least what I observed.
    But again, I myself was moving more into the engineering direction. That's why
    maybe – just the things around me changed, but not the environment, let's say.
  sec: 759
  time: '12:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right, I would agree with that because I think that five, seven years ago,
    we didn't have the infrastructure, really, to deploy. For instance, we couldn't
    even speak about MLOps, because we didn't really have infrastructures to operationalize
    whatever. Actually, the notion of data science is really, really old. If you think
    about, for instance – let's leave academia alone, because they have been doing
    this forever, kind of analyzing data and coming up with inference based on that.
    But if you look into the industry, for instance, these really old industries such
    as insurance, or for instance, banking – they have had their quant desks, they
    have had their analytics desks, they have had their actuarial practitioners for
    a very, very long time. [cross-talk]
  sec: 796
  time: '13:16'
  who: Olga
- line: 50 years, right? For 50 years or… 30 years, for sure.
  sec: 843
  time: '14:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Longer than that. The thing is, to be honest, were they doing data science?
    Absolutely. Were they putting it into prod? Not really. I remember seven years
    ago, there were a lot of use cases deployed on a local machine. This is true.
    But nowadays, it's definitely the growth of computational technologies and the
    rise of cloud which kind of goes to the whole thing. And I agree with you, there
    is now a lot of focus on engineering. Also, my honest opinion is that it takes
    a village to deliver AI sustainably. It’s not just one person who knows a bunch
    of algorithms, to be honest.
  sec: 849
  time: '14:09'
  who: Olga
- header: The two qualities of an excellent data scientist
- line: Now, when you're hiring data scientists – when you're looking for a data scientist
    – what are the qualities you're looking for, typically?
  sec: 889
  time: '14:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are two things which are very, very important. We always… and this prevails,
    it's true for me. It was true for me as a hiring manager in my current job, and
    it was true for me when I was working for another company. Two things, essentially,
    which are pivotal for me. One is technical skills – they have to be excellent.
    Really, really. This is something that you really need to bring your hard skills
    with you. You really have to work on them. If you are feeling that you're not
    quite there, there is no reason for you not to get there. It's all a matter of
    practice and studying.
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Olga
- line: Well, what do you mean by “excellent technical skills”? Can you maybe give
    an example? Great Python knowledge? Ability to solve different algorithmic challenges?
    Or?
  sec: 935
  time: '15:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a great question. What I mean by “great technical skills” is essentially.
    [sighs] How do I say this? You know, if you're a professional chef, you know that
    you’re good. [Alexey laughs] You know how to chop an onion very, very well, but
    you also know how to create masterpieces with it. What I'm trying to say is that
    essentially, for me, excellence is something which cannot be cataloged, guys –
    you cannot really put a definition on that. But for me, it manifests in understanding
    very, very deeply what you do. For me, an excellent data scientist understands
    what the solution does on the level of underlying algorithms, one that can really
    plot it, write it, describe it with a mathematical formula on a piece of paper.
    And they could explain very, very simply what it actually does, and how it does
    it.
  sec: 945
  time: '15:45'
  who: Olga
- line: What would be the underlying assumptions on data? What would be the risk?
    One of my favorite interview questions, for instance, which I asked a lot of people
    is, “What does it mean? What does data mean?” It sounds very, very obvious, but
    try it. You will see so many interesting answers to that. It gives you a lot of
    background of how people actually feel what they do. Then another thing, which
    is very, very important for excellence is, well, essentially practice. You have
    to have a passion for this. Because if you don't have passion for this, you will
    not be able to practice this over a long time. How they say “practice makes perfect,”
    there is no other way.
  sec: 945
  time: '15:45'
  who: Olga
- line: There is no degree of talent, in my experience, that will compensate for lack
    of practice. Something has to drive you forward. I mean, it's obviously discipline,
    but it's also practice. So yeah, through practice, an understanding of what the
    thing does, and constant learning, you eventually achieve excellence.
  sec: 945
  time: '15:45'
  who: Olga
- line: I guess this is pretty subjective. When hiring, you want to be objective,
    right? So how do you check if this person really has this deep understanding of
    what they do? I guess you just asked questions, like “Hey. What do you do? Can
    you explain it to me?” Right?
  sec: 1067
  time: '17:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Do you mind if I answer about the second aspect of what I'm looking
    for? You asked me about what I look for in a data scientist.
  sec: 1083
  time: '18:03'
  who: Olga
- line: Yeah, please. The first one was technical? Right? And the second?
  sec: 1091
  time: '18:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Attitude.
  sec: 1095
  time: '18:15'
  who: Olga
- line: Attitude. Okay.
  sec: 1096
  time: '18:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think that's equally important – one of the most important things
    is the attitude. You have to be a constant learner, you have to know your worth,
    you have to be humble – you have to love it, really. Also know precisely, or at
    least be honest with yourself, where you’re going to and what you're going to
    do there. Try to find as much as possible. So are you going to work on a product?
    Now you go to work for the customers? Are you going to work deeply in research?
    And then have the right approach to that.
  sec: 1097
  time: '18:17'
  who: Olga
- line: So how do you check love?
  sec: 1133
  time: '18:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: How do I check what, sorry? [cross-talk]
  sec: 1135
  time: '18:55'
  who: Olga
- line: You said attitude is important and that people should love what they do. How
    do you check if they actually love it and they are not there for the money? [cross-talk]
  sec: 1137
  time: '18:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: It shows. It absolutely shows. I mean, passion is something that you cannot
    really conceal.
  sec: 1145
  time: '19:05'
  who: Olga
- line: Can you maybe mention how it can manifest when you see that the candidate
    doesn't have this attitude or doesn't have this love that you talked about?
  sec: 1150
  time: '19:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I think, again, you are absolutely right – it's very subjective. I'm
    not a guidebook on hiring, to be honest. I'm a bunch of [cross-talk]
  sec: 1163
  time: '19:23'
  who: Olga
- line: I’m curious, but you don’t have to answer that.
  sec: 1171
  time: '19:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I promise you, a fair share of those experiences and views will potentially
    be corrected over time because I'm wrong very often, like every human person.
    Also it's a collection of mistakes that I have made, but what is true for me nowadays
    – “How do you check for attitude?” You ask about what I would do. –I would ask
    about motivation. “Why do you do data science?” Potentially not so directly, but
    you can ask a bunch of questions around this to understand what the person's motivation
    is to go to the field.
  sec: 1174
  time: '19:34'
  who: Olga
- line: So it would be behavioral questions like, “Tell me about a time you did something.”
    Right? These kinds of questions?
  sec: 1209
  time: '20:09'
  who: Alexey
- header: What makes Alexey do this podcast
- line: Let me try it. So, Alexey, why are you into data science? What makes you do
    this podcast?
  sec: 1216
  time: '20:16'
  who: Olga
- line: Okay. [laughs] I was not prepared for that. I guess meeting people, if we're
    talking about this specific podcast. Meeting people and learning from them – learning
    from you. Right now, I'm actually taking notes. For those who are watching it
    on video, not listening – I'm showing now the notes I make. Then after this episode,
    there will be a transcription. I can go through this transcription and really
    learn this again and again. This is super useful – with every episode, with every
    guest, I learn something new. I guess that's one of the motivations why I keep
    doing it.
  sec: 1223
  time: '20:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Perfect. That sounds really good.
  sec: 1262
  time: '21:02'
  who: Olga
- line: But your question was about data science, right?
  sec: 1263
  time: '21:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m still not done. Do you mind if I dig a little bit deeper? Of the episodes
    that you have conducted with your guests, what resonates most? I mean it doesn't
    necessarily have to apply to people – the topics or things. If I would ask you,
    potentially, wake you up in the middle of the night and say, “Alexey, what have
    been the most interesting topics? Topics that have been the most important to
    you that have been discussed here – what have those been?
  sec: 1265
  time: '21:05'
  who: Olga
- line: Usually those are around career, more soft topics, rather than hard topics.
    Not topics about things like how GPT-3 works, but more like how you progress in
    your career, why are you doing what you do, or how you became what you are right
    now – so the career trajectory, different roles – this is the kind of stuff I
    really like. One of the recent ones was, for example, yesterday I interviewed
    a person about his experience of becoming a company founder. He was creating open
    source and became a founder. These are the kinds of episodes I really love.
  sec: 1294
  time: '21:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Awesome. That sounds really, really good. And the last question around this
    – what have you learned doing this exercise, this podcast? What is that you have
    learned about people, about data scientists, about the human aspect?
  sec: 1339
  time: '22:19'
  who: Olga
- line: That is a pretty broad question. I don't know how to answer that. [laughs]
  sec: 1355
  time: '22:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: The most important thing – that kind of sticks.
  sec: 1359
  time: '22:39'
  who: Olga
- line: People are interesting. Everyone is different. And everyone has a story to
    tell. It's funny, when I reach out to people and say, “Hey, do you want to be
    on the podcast?” Some of them say “Yeah, but there’s nothing I can talk about.”
    But then it's like the best podcast episode.
  sec: 1363
  time: '22:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: How Alexey get the latest information on data science
- line: Right. And then another, almost last question – I also know that you have
    a day job as a principal data scientist. On your reading list – the stuff that
    you're reading right now – what is the most prominent source of where you get
    the news about the latest updates on data science?
  sec: 1381
  time: '23:01'
  who: Olga
- line: Yeah. Twitter, I guess. I check Twitter and then if something gets a lot of
    exposure, I look into this. But usually these are topics more around the engineering
    aspects of data science, rather than “the latest trends in AI”. I, of course,
    played with DALL-E, it was fun. I tried different prompts. You know what DALL-E
    is, right? You give it a prompt and then it generates nine pictures. I was trying
    weird stuff like, the guy from KFC is Colonel Sanders, right? He's on the logo
    of KFC, the fast food chain. So I was trying things like, “Colonel Sanders is
    having a Zoom call with puppies to take over McDonald's,” and then it will generate
    random pictures. So that was fun. But yeah, I'm just playing with this kind of
    stuff. But I am reading more about engineering stuff.
  sec: 1397
  time: '23:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I see. And I infer that this is why, probably because you have more
    passion for the engineering aspect of data science rather than the algorithmic
    one. Like you said, everybody's different. Some people, like myself, for instance,
    will be more driven to potentially… I mean, I'm very much into technological development.
    The first thing when I read about new technology, the first thing that I tried
    to infer for myself is how it works under the hood, so “What is the underlying
    method?” Today, when you said “Bayesian,” I was like, “Oh, my God,” because the
    level of conversations that I normally have in my daily job, I do not often get
    asked about it. And that's a shame. I should probably work on learning it myself.
    I probably should have more such conversations because I really, really love that.
  sec: 1455
  time: '24:15'
  who: Olga
- line: I just remember it from my university days – when you have point estimates,
    it's a frequentist approach, but when you have a distribution, that's Bayesian.
    That's why I thought, “Okay, let me show I’m smart too.” [chuckles]
  sec: 1503
  time: '25:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: You are. [laughs] You officially are. Stamp of approval. [laughs]
  sec: 1516
  time: '25:16'
  who: Olga
- header: How Olga checks a candidate’s technical skills
- line: I think I asked you a question, which you kind of diverted from. We were talking
    about two things that you look at – technical skills and attitude. I think both
    of these things are kind of hard to measure. They're more subjective, but there
    must be some objective way to measure this, right? Attitude is more like what
    you just tried to me by asking these questions. [chuckles] What about technical
    skills? Do you also do this by asking questions like, “Tell me about a project
    you did.”?
  sec: 1521
  time: '25:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You know, the thing about that – I have to be honest with you – I have
    had many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many interviews
    in my life. So this is something that you eventually get – it's like muscle training.
    You get a lot of intuition, just based on the experience that you would have had.
    Like you, I very much like getting to know people. For me, the interview process
    is always an opportunity for me to learn from another person – where they come
    from, what they have learned. Every time I have an interview, I learn something
    new. And that's absolutely fascinating. I think it's the most rewarding activity
    that you can do. [sighs]
  sec: 1551
  time: '25:51'
  who: Olga
- line: But I would be very cautious answering your question. Because you definitely
    do have objective criteria – and you have to have objective criteria. It's absolutely
    mandatory. I will elaborate on that in a second. However, you must not forget
    that you’re dealing with people and people are not necessarily always objective.
    So I think one of the fallacies of the data scientists (generally, any technical
    people, I think), who move into more kind of a soft-ish discipline, is not to
    forget that you’re actually dealing with people and not to expect them to follow
    a blueprint or kind of “if this, then that” approach. With human beings, it’s
    utterly wrong. At least I think so. But, on objective criteria.
  sec: 1551
  time: '25:51'
  who: Olga
- line: For instance, for me, it has always been very important to conduct a technical
    interview. You could have different shapes and forms of that. It could have some
    kind of code exercise, it could have some kind of analytical exercise as well,
    and then you would ask a bunch of questions. And one of them is, “What does it
    mean?” [laughs] Then it will also help you understand very many things about the
    depth of somebody's knowledge. For specific things, you also…
  sec: 1551
  time: '25:51'
  who: Olga
- line: I think one of the things that you need to also remind yourself of (or at
    least I do, when I interview) is to stay humble, and not dig into places where
    I know stuff. Because I can ask somebody, like, “Are there any kinds of distributions
    that wouldn't have a mean?” And then get a person completely lost and frustrated
    during the interview. But I also have in mind why I'm asking these questions –
    what do I want to test? What do I expect this person to be able to do in order
    to be successful at this job? So this is important as well, to also to prepare
    for your technical interviews and be very meaningful about what you're asking.
    Also, to be respectful all the time.
  sec: 1551

  who: Olga

  sec: 1756
  time: '29:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So I remember a person who we hired answered that question and they
    were very specific in their answer, because they also have given kind of a textbook
    definition of a mean, or an average, of the data. They have provided an example
    of potentially how you measure this in a sample, they have provided an example
    of how it extrapolates to whatever population you will take the sample from, and
    then they have provided a practical example of how this applies to life. This
    was really, really good. It was really impressive for me.
  sec: 1759

  who: Olga
- line: Yeah, that's pretty extensive.
  sec: 1802
  time: '30:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: The depths of knowledge. You know, for instance, one of the ways you could
    ask, if you're still not convinced with my favorite question. You could ask somebody,
    “Let's assume you want to move to a new country, which you know nothing about.
    Their currency also says nothing to you.” I mean, you can obviously check it at
    places like xt.com, but you will not live that and it will not be something that
    would be natural to you to operate in – in this environment. “And then you would
    want to buy or rent a house. And then you would definitely want to check the neighborhood
    and stuff like that – you would want to know the average level of prices in this
    neighborhood or in this country. Basically, what would be the main statistic?
    What will be the mean, essentially, and what would be the deviations of that and
    stuff like that.” So, on a human level, that makes a lot of sense to know why
    you want to know this. And this gives you an understanding, essentially, why you
    want to know this is what this means, and how it translates.
  sec: 1803
  time: '30:03'
  who: Olga
- line: Interesting.
  sec: 1875
  time: '31:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: One other thing, it’s also maybe it's because I'm a statistician – one of
    the things is that people very much talk about predictive statistics and prescriptive
    – this is very, very important. Definitely. But one should not underestimate the
    power of descriptive statistics. When I studied mathematics, they told me it’s
    elemental not because it's simple – it's elemental because there are elements
    there from which other more complex things are constructed.
  sec: 1876
  time: '31:16'
  who: Olga

    characteristics of data, of the sample you have, right?
  sec: 1906

    I have the time, I will just read old books like, for instance, Hastie/Tibshirani,

- line: Okay. Since we talked a bit about statistics and math – what do you think?
    What is more important, a strong mathematical background, or a strong engineering
    background when we hire people? Or do we just hire both? How do we decide?
  sec: 1952
  time: '32:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s a very interesting question. I think it depends on what you want to
    achieve.
  sec: 1970
  time: '32:50'
  who: Olga
- line: But let's say you have a team, and you want to hire a data scientist for the
    team. You have some objective –there is a product – you want to add artificial
    intelligence/machine learning to this product. Now you have a task to hire three
    data scientists. So how do you decide if you want to get people that have a stronger
    mathematical background or those who are stronger engineers?
  sec: 1976
  time: '32:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I hire my data scientists, I need to be able to, very, very disambiguously
    know what I want them to do. Just today, we have had a team meeting and we discusses
    things about the scope of data science work recently, because it's an emerging
    discipline still. It’s been very broad and it doesn't always play as a favor for
    data scientists. You know, in German, there is a concept of Eierlegende Wollmilchsau.
  sec: 2004

  who: Olga
- line: I have no idea what that is. [chuckles]
  sec: 2032
  time: '33:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s a very interesting animal. It's essentially a pig, which also gives wool,
    and also gives milk, and also gives eggs. So we should avoid having a data… I
    mean, a more polite way to call this is a Swiss army knife, or another way to
    call it is jack of all trades. But being that person is really no fun. Honestly.
    And it is also difficult to retain somebody like this in the long run. Because
    if you expect the person to be able to do everything, like “Yeah, whatever. You
    can, so you have to.” It's not necessarily fun to be that person.
  sec: 2034
  time: '33:54'
  who: Olga
- line: Okay.
  sec: 2074
  time: '34:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: So you have to be very specific. When you want to hire data scientists, you
    have to be very, very specific. What do you expect them to actually do?
  sec: 2075
  time: '34:35'
  who: Olga
- line: If what you expect is integrating with the backend of whatever the existing
    team is doing, then it's probably more engineering, but if you expect them to
    do more analytics, more talking to business, then it's probably more on the other
    side of the spectrum, right?
  sec: 2083
  time: '34:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Let's assume you are a startup and your budget is really limited. You
    want to deploy a very specific use case. And then you already have a couple of
    people. Let's say, with no lack of generality, your language is Python and you
    have everything. Then, for instance, you would want somebody who will have a deep
    understanding of the underlying algorithm, and will be able to develop a custom
    solution, and who will be able to put it into prod and ensure that it's not just
    kind of something that works in the research environment, that it runs in real
    time, its realizable, and so on, and so forth.
  sec: 2100
  time: '35:00'
  who: Olga
- line: You would expect this person to understand how this works, how this could
    be parallelizable. But potentially, if you already have a couple of very, very
    good software engineers, you will also be able and you will be willing to potentially
    forgive a lot of (forgive us the wrong word) but be kind of accepting of this
    person's potential coding skills or on par with those of the professional software
    engineer. And actually, generally, for data scientists an expectation should not
    be that they should be an awesome software engineer, because it's not their job.
    I mean, they can be. I have met people who are. I have respect for them, to be
    honest. I'm not one of them, unfortunately.
  sec: 2100
  time: '35:00'
  who: Olga
- line: But en masse, because you would also have expectations of a very deep understanding
    of algorithms – what the underlying thing does and how it basically stems from
    the data landscape that you have – what kind of they do have to have. You would
    not expect this person to have tremendous programming skills. They can write what
    allows them to research and that's okay. While it's commented. [chuckles]
  sec: 2100
  time: '35:00'
  who: Olga
- line: So if you need somebody with strong engineer skills, just hire a developer,
    not a data scientist? Right?
  sec: 2201
  time: '36:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Depends. Because, for instance, if you have a solution that you need to be
    able to productionize – if you need a solution where, essentially, the engineering
    aspect is more important for you, then you will look for somebody who has an understanding
    of underlying data science methods, but not necessarily so well-versed in different
    underlying algorithms. One who has an understanding that is potentially a little
    bit basic of how the mathematics under the hood works, but then you would need
    them to really, really be good in programming. It's also fine. It depends on what
    the business needs.
  sec: 2208
  time: '36:48'
  who: Olga
- line: We have quite a few questions. From the questions I prepared, we covered only
    two out of I don’t know how many. [laughs] But yeah, I think it’s time we also
    took a look at the questions from the audience.

    humans and hiring data scientists will not be necessary anymore?”

  time: '37:44'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 2271

  who: Olga
- line: Never. [chuckles] Why?
  sec: 2272
  time: '37:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Well, because of the human aspect. You know, there is a fantastic
    book called “Human and AI,” which is written by Accenture’s chief technology officer,
    I think in around 2015. And it talks about the professionals of the (so-called)
    future. Definitely AI is developing – Auto ML is tremendously powerful and this
    power grows day by day. And this is good, because we also want it to. Also, some
    no-code environments such as, for instance, from different designers. They''re
    also fantastic because they enabled so-called “citizen data scientists”.'
  sec: 2278
  time: '37:58'
  who: Olga
- line: This is the very, very right way to go, because you will have some of the
    solutions, really robustly tested and safe for a person with no degree in advanced
    mathematics to be able to safely use it to meet the goals of the business. But
    you would never… This is what we discussed in the beginning. Data scientists are
    first and foremost people. You will never be able to replace the human at the
    end of it. Because you do things for humans, essentially, so this is why I think
    it's never. I’m not a futurist, but I think you will need a human in the loop.
  sec: 2278
  time: '37:58'
  who: Olga
- line: I think one of the most common reasons that data science and machine learning
    projects fail is misalignment – miscommunication between different groups – like
    between the stakeholders, the product people, the users, and the data scientists
    who implement the solution. You have to have this conversation.
  sec: 2361
  time: '39:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: You have to have this communication with others in order to do what is the
    right thing to do. Right? Now if you replace data scientists who are okay with
    communication (maybe not the best ones, but okay) with machines who do not communicate
    at all, who expect clean data then, of course, it will not work. We still need
    communication. AI will not magically solve all the problems of your users.
  sec: 2361
  time: '39:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: You know, there is certain automation possible for data quality checks as
    well. So it's not about that. It's what you said – about the delivery, or the
    deployment of an AI project (or any project). The most important thing is vitamin
    C, which is Communication. And this is not my finding. I read it in a book. There
    is a woman from Spain, Araceli Segarra, and she is the first woman who has climbed
    Mount Everest and she wrote a book about this. I love this book. I think one of
    the things which resonated with me most was – essentially, she provided examples
    where the lack of vitamin C was leading to outcomes where people literally died,
    going up. So this is pivotal that people communicate, really. And this is why
    I think that you will always, always need people.
  sec: 2409
  time: '40:09'
  who: Olga
- line: Yeah, you can automate some things, but Auto ML aims at simplifying the work
    of data scientists, not replacing them.
  sec: 2471
  time: '41:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Essentially, you have hit the nail on the head. It's simplifying
    the work that you're doing. Because before, you would spend a lot of time trying
    and testing different algorithms, but now you have the opportunity to kind of
    have the machine do this for you very, very quickly, and then save a lot of your
    time and energy. But it's the same, like, before we all used to wash the dishes
    by hand and now we all have dishwashers.
  sec: 2478
  time: '41:18'
  who: Olga
- line: I recently discovered the beauty of having a dishwasher. I didn't know how
    to start it. We had a dishwasher for like, eight years? I just didn't know how
    to turn it on. My life will never be the same now, because I know how to turn
    it on now. [laughs]

  who: Alexey
- header: Should data scientists transition into management? (the importance of communication
    in an organization)
- line: Anyways, an interesting question, “Personally, I am good at data science,
    but my manager wants me to do a course in management, which I feel is not relevant
    for me since my passion is in data science.” Do you have any suggestions for people
    in this situation? What can they do? Let's say you don't want to become a manager,
    but your boss is kind of trying to push you a little bit in this direction, saying,
    “Hey, we need managers. We want to grow the team.”
  sec: 2529
  time: '42:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's a vitamin C thing. I think you need to have an honest conversation
    with the manager and understand, basically, where they are coming from. To understand
    what their motivation is and why they're pushing you to do that – what they want
    you to do. Do they want you to really lead the team? Do they want you to take
    more responsibility? And essentially, why you? Because, essentially, if you don't
    want to, you don't have to. That's the thing. The career path of a data scientist
    is a very, very hot and acute topic. People expect some kind of blueprints that
    will be robustly tested in this. And it's not possible, because discipline, especially
    in the industry that exists for about seven years. A little bit more maybe.
  sec: 2560
  time: '42:40'
  who: Olga
- line: But you still don't have enough examples of people who would reach C-level
    positions. I mean, there are, but there are not as many as you would have, potentially,
    in engineering – to be able to understand what your options would be. Because
    in many environments, people assume automatically that the only way up is through
    management. When you start managing, how my boss likes to say, which I really,
    really like – he says “Everybody can be a leader, but not everybody can be a manager.”
    Extending this quote, I will say that everybody can, and it's absolutely fine.
    You don't have to manage people to be a data science leader.
  sec: 2560
  time: '42:40'
  who: Olga
- line: Because you have to understand one thing – it's physics. It's the law of conservation
    of energy, right? So in order for you to give more to something, you will have
    to take this energy from somewhere else. So if you manage people or if you spend
    time in business meetings, it means you're less hands- on and you lose touch with
    the technology. I mean, you practice your craft much less, if at all. It's also
    something that you have to take into consideration. So it's essentially a matter
    what you do in your life, you know?
  sec: 2560
  time: '42:40'
  who: Olga
- line: Going back to this example, I would say to have an honest conversation and
    try to understand where the manager is coming from, and then provide an alternative
    solution. Say, “Look, potentially, if I do this, you will lose a great data scientist
    because I will kind of lose my practice. Are you ready to do this? Are you willing
    to do this? Does it go well with the goals of the organization?” Because maybe
    there is a better solution – you can hire somebody else to be a team lead, and
    let this person be a kind of advanced, as a manager/specialist or however you
    call them in your organization – a kind of a senior responsible person for technology
    or something like this.
  sec: 2560
  time: '42:40'

    get an average manager?

    want to be? Depends.
  sec: 2766
  time: '46:06'
  who: Olga
- line: Yeah, there are different one, like data scientists who are more leaning towards
    the business side of things. And then from analytics, I think the switch is not
    that difficult, right? And there are data scientists who are more into MLOps and
    engineering, and then it would require taking coding classes and getting practice.

    anything, because we all learn. This is something which is very, very important.
    What makes a great data scientist? A great education, and then how many hours
    of practice they have. You know how they say that in order to become an expert

    when we just started this conversation – about inviting you to this podcast. You
    mentioned that you managed to attract a significant share of excellent female
    candidates with excellent female talents to your team. I thought about this, and
    I'm also part of the hiring process – I'm a hiring manager, I also take part in
    hiring as the interviewer – and I don't see many females in the candidates. So
    maybe the ratio is 9 to 1, so 90% males and only one, one and only 10% females.

  sec: 2874
  time: '47:54'
  who: Alexey

    topic, which is very dear to my heart for obvious reasons. Probably I will open
    the gates of hell, but you know what? I guess it's the truth and it has to be
    spoken. It's very, very hard. I mean, it's much easier for us now, but it's generally
    very, very hard for us women in STEM fields, because the bias against us is systemic.
    It's more pronounced in some societies and less pronounced in other societies.
    But if you focus on this a little bit more, you would see that.

    and incentivized to go into things such as engineering, mathematics, or physics.
    Whereas girls are more expected in social pressure to prioritize stuff like liberal
    arts (which is a very honorable discipline) and care. But there are not too many
    girls who would choose mathematics. I will be absolutely honest, some women just
    don't care. They're not interested in it, really. And it's all right, because
    some people are interested in literature.

- line: Some people are interested in knowing history. Some people are interested
    in music. It's all right to not care about mathematics or engineering. But it
    has nothing to do with gender, but a lot with the social kind of pressure and
    the expectations. Also on what people intake from their families, which have also
    been brought up by generations of people thinking things a certain way. So it's
    not potentially some one person to be [cross-talk]
  sec: 2887
  time: '48:07'
  who: Olga
- line: I think I know what you're talking about. In my group, when I was studying
    at university, there was only one girl – in a group of 25 people.
  sec: 2986
  time: '49:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I started, we had 25% females and I think that was quite a lot. But then
    later on, something that happened also is that girls are a little bit overseen,
    oftentimes – not all the time, but oftentimes – when they study, because they're
    not expected to have a certain level of ability or dedication or whatnot. I have
    not encountered this myself, but I had friends who told me that they personally
    have encountered this discrimination, I would say, based on the agenda. They would
    say, “You will never attain certain heights because you're a woman,” directly
    or indirectly.
  sec: 2995
  time: '49:55'
  who: Olga
- line: Also, it becomes increasingly difficult for women when they enter the workforce,
    because there are many biases such as, for instance, like-like bias. So you would
    normally unconsciously be prone to like people who are more similar to you because
    you feel safer around (let's say, broadly) people who look like you, who are like
    you. And this is why if you go to an assessment center, or to a company, and it's
    populated with males – that's it. They're going to basically say, “Yeah, this
    is a safer choice,” unconsciously, with all the best intentions in the world.
  sec: 2995
  time: '49:55'
  who: Olga
- line: If you want to be able to attract diverse talent – basically, people who are
    different from you – you should potentially shift your mindset a little bit and
    also be more open and be more willing to understand where other people are coming
    from and what is important to them. That also applies to women, essentially. Another
    thing that is important to do is knowing – knowing that there are more males than
    females and the system is skewed (there’s kind of a male prevalence in this industry)
    and to apply more effort. Because I have seen a lot of people kind of expecting
    that somebody, all out of the blue, will source them outstanding female talent
    and just say, “Look, you choose.” It doesn't really work like this.
  sec: 2995
  time: '49:55'
  who: Olga
- line: You have to be able to go out on a limb and go and search for these people.
    You go search LinkedIn and you search your weak ties – this is actually one of
    the best ways because application through reference or hiring through reference,
    in my experience, works really well. Because if you know people who are excellent,
    chances are, the people from their surrounding are also excellent. Then you can
    just basically ask and say, “Hey, do you know any excellent female data scientists
    who are now looking for a job?”
  sec: 2995
  time: '49:55'
  who: Olga
- line: The last very important thing, which is also very important to mention, is
    that there is research (and I don't want to sound that I'm against men or anything
    – obviously, I'm not) but one thing also to say that there is research which shows
    that a woman would feel secure to apply for a job only when she ticks 100% of
    the requirement boxes.
  sec: 2995
  time: '49:55'
  who: Olga
- line: And males are found to be able to kind of go with it, when they tick around
    60% of boxes. So you would really need to empower and encourage, potentially sometimes
    convince and help somebody and also boost their self-confidence. Because guess
    what? Self confidence has been unboosted over generations for years, while the
    technical knowledge is actually brilliant. Women are also excellent in many things.
    I mean, every person is a different world. You cannot just attribute some qualities
    to a man or a woman. And I say this was my shallow knowledge of psychology. [laughs]
    But en masse, what I have seen is that women are really, really good at organizing
    work – excellent.
  sec: 2995
  time: '49:55'
  who: Olga
- line: One of the questions I wanted to ask is how to make job descriptions more
    attractive to female candidates. I think you partly answered that question by
    citing this research that women apply when they tick 100% of the boxes, but when
    men apply when it's 60%. So maybe one of the things that we can do is, when coming
    up with a job description, list only the skills that are absolutely necessary
    and omit all the ‘nice to have’ ones, right?
  sec: 3233
  time: '53:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think that's always a good approach. But it's my personal opinion,
    because at the end of the day, regardless of gender or background, you want to
    hire a person who can do the job really well. There is no such thing as a perfect
    candidate. You should also be very, very frank with yourself – what do you absolutely
    need the person to bring and what can they learn on the job? And you have to facilitate
    the resources for them to learn on the job as well. But I guess, yes – you don't
    want to end up hiring Eierlegende Wollmilchsau because it's not sustainable and
    they're not [cross-talk]

  sec: 3302
  time: '55:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so you would want to basically – my main suggestion is always to boil
    it down to what you actually need this person to be able to do.
  sec: 3303
  time: '55:03'
  who: Olga
- header: Changing a job description to find talent
- line: I came across a startup, or a company, where they offer you to upload a job
    description, and in this job description, they will highlight things that say,
    “Okay, if you include this word, it will discourage female candidates. Will you
    consider replacing it with a different word – a synonym.” Do you think this works?
    Is this how it actually works? I was quite surprised when I saw this. It was like
    replacing one synonym by another and they just say, “Okay, if you do this, then
    you will increase chances of getting more female candidates.”
  sec: 3313
  time: '55:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it does. I think generally, it does. Yes. Because I believe that there
    are some wordings which feel more appealing, potentially. I would not say to just
    try this, and if you rewrite your job description, you would also find it more
    appealing to men. Because normally, it will suggest that you focus on things such
    as collaboration, team spirit, psychological safety. I don't know a person of
    any gender who would not like that.

- header: Long gaps in the CV
- line: I see that we don't have a lot of time left, and I know you need to go. So
    maybe, I don't know if you can answer that quickly, but maybe you can try. “Will
    you consider a person who has a gap of six years while hiring?”
  sec: 3391
  time: '56:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, why not? Why not?
  sec: 3406
  time: '56:46'
  who: Olga
- line: Well, because of the gap. Maybe you think, “Okay, they don't have the skills
    that are needed.” Let's say, if I have a gap, I might think this way – that the
    hiring manager would not think I have the same level of skills as the person who
    just graduated from a data science boot camp or something. Or not a boot camp,
    but a university or whatever.
  sec: 3409
  time: '56:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: You know, the reasons people take gaps in their career are very, very different.
    And oftentimes, they have nothing to do with their ability to do things. [cross-talk]
  sec: 3432

  who: Olga
- line: Like kids, for example, for women?
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not only for women. For instance, I know people who are men who have taken
    gaps just to take care of their families, because they had. This is normal. I
    mean, life happens. But I don't think that it in any way reflects their skills.
    Absolutely not.
  sec: 3446
  time: '57:26'
  who: Olga
- line: Do you maybe have a tip for them to feel better, or more secure, when applying?
    When you have a gap, how can you feel better about it and just keep applying?
  sec: 3467
  time: '57:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: I guess, it’s what you said – keep applying and believe in yourself. The thing
    about that is – I can tell you a lot of encouraging things – but the thing is
    that it's on everybody to believe in themselves. Yeah, it's scary out there. Absolutely.
    You know, I feel insecure or kind of anxious or vulnerable many times – often
    and frequently – because I'm a human being and it's part of the human experience.
    But at the end of the day, you just think, “Okay, I already have a no as a baseline.
    What do I have to lose? That somebody basically makes a judgment about my gap.
    It's on them, really. I don't have to inherit this. I don't have to absorb that.”

    The word will be there. Okay. I think that's all. Thanks a lot for joining us.
    Thanks a lot for sharing your expertise with us. We didn't cover most of the questions
    I prepared, but that's okay, I guess, because the conversation we had was really
    nice. Thanks for asking me questions. This is not something that happens quite
