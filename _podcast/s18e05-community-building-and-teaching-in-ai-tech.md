title: Community Building and Teaching in AI & Tech
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about community building. We have a special guest today,
    Erum. Erum is a Lead Machine Learning Engineer and PhD researcher at Justus Liebig
    University. Did I pronounce it correctly?
  sec: 85
  time: '1:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 104
  time: '1:44'
  who: Erum
- line: So, Erum specializes in AI for education, she instructs at the Woman in AI
    Academy and leads Omdena Academy. Previously, she taught deep learning internationally
    and organized data science boot camps. And many more things. You will probably
    tell us about them. So thanks for joining us. Thanks for being here. Welcome.
  sec: 106
  time: '1:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you for having me. I'm so excited to share whatever I've been doing.
    Yeah.
  sec: 135
  time: '2:15'
  who: Erum
- line: So the questions for today's interview were prepared, as always, by Johanna
    Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, for help. And let's start.
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Alexey
- header: Erum's Background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of today, which is community building, let's
    start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 152
  time: '2:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so I'm Erum. I am from Pakistan. Currently, I am based in Germany, as
    Alexey shared. I'm doing my PhD over here. How did I start? I basically belong
    to a not-so-much-developed area of Pakistan, where females are not even allowed
    to get an education. But I'm the lucky one. I got an education, then I moved to
    the city, and then I started working with the community. In that manner, I was
    also lucky in that instead of joining and learning by joining some lessons or
    lectures, I started delivering workshops and courses which I used to plan.
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Erum
- line: "Then I have many networks, and interestingly, through those networks, I got\
    \ my research position in University Giessen, and that is Justus Liebig University\
    \ in Giessen. The community I was referring to was\u2026 Do you remember, in one\
    \ of the projects in Germany, I was doing the project and this university applied.\
    \ The project was selected, and then I was mentoring that project. Then I offered\
    \ them, saying that it is really a good project, so why should not start and offer\
    \ a PhD position on that? They gladly accepted that, and then they offered me,\
    \ \u201CWhy don't you send anyone for that position?\u201D And I thought, \u201C\
    Why not? I should join.\u201D So that's how I'm here today."
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Erum
- line: Which city are you based in?
  sec: 275
  time: '4:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I am in Giessen \u2013 it\u2019s near Frankfurt."
  sec: 277
  time: '4:37'
  who: Erum
- line: Uh-huh. Okay. So the big Frankfurt?
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 285
  time: '4:45'
  who: Erum
- line: Yeah. I have never been to that Frankfurt.
  sec: 286
  time: '4:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: You should visit sometime. [chuckles]
  sec: 290
  time: '4:50'
  who: Erum
- line: "Yeah. So you work at Omdena and you\u2026 What's your title there?"
  sec: 294
  time: '4:54'
  who: Alexey
- header: "Omdena Academy and Erum\u2019s Role There"
- line: Currently I am head of Omdena Academy, but I started as a Lead Machine Learning
    Engineer, and then we started delivering courses. Then we started with Omdena
    School, which we just changed to Omdena Academy. So currently I'm Head of Omdena
    Academy.
  sec: 303
  time: '5:03'
  who: Erum
- line: "It's amazing. I'm sorry to hear that in the area where you grew up, that\
    \ women cannot get an education. And it's a very lucky situation that you managed\
    \ to do this. Hopefully, this situation changes. Luckily, we can speak here because\
    \ you got the education \u2013 you went through all the things you said. Yeah,\
    \ I'm really interested to learn more about Omdena \u2013 what Omdena is doing\
    \ in general and what you specifically do there."
  sec: 328
  time: '5:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "So Omdena is also a global community. It started back in 2019 and I am one\
    \ of the collaborators. We call every participant a \u201Ccollaborator\u201D.\
    \ It works [as follows:] you have a real-world challenge and collaborators around\
    \ the world solve that problem with the help of AI. We started building a mental\
    \ assistive application in 2019, then finding anomalies on the surface of Mars\
    \ and figuring out if life is possible or not \u2013 something like that. But\
    \ the major learning is \u2013 we are not [an organization] that is working from\
    \ one country or from one educational/social background."
  sec: 364
  time: '6:04'
  who: Erum
- line: "There is a group of 50-60 people from different backgrounds, ages, qualifications\
    \ \u2013 and we learn together. Initially, it comes up to you like, \u201CThis\
    \ is the project and you have to get to the bottom of the solution to the problem.\u201D\
    \ That is when Omdena started. It was a really great learning platform. Firstly,\
    \ you learn by doing and that is [using] real-world datasets, which is very rare\
    \ in AI projects. The second thing is, you have people from diverse backgrounds\
    \ and you network with them \u2013 you learn how they deal with situations, and\
    \ they support you. If you want to do something, they refer resources for you\
    \ \u2013 they help you out. This is how Omdena works. What do I do there?"
  sec: 364
  time: '6:04'
  who: Erum
- line: "We started from this very first project \u2013 I was working as a collaborator.\
    \ Then I joined Omdena on and off \u2013 we started building the graphic. I had\
    \ a bit of experience in graphics, so I started building certificates. We thought\
    \ we should have\u2026 Because AI and data science courses are very expensive\
    \ and out of reach for underdeveloped communities, so why not build courses from\
    \ these projects that we are doing with real-world [data]? That could be a capacity\
    \ building for the collaborator. For example, if I want to be a teacher, I can\
    \ teach these people free of cost \u2013 it will be helping them in learning and\
    \ it will be helping them to be a good instructor. [Thus], we started this program\
    \ \u2013two people from that project can deliver the course and anyone, without\
    \ any geographical boundaries or financial boundaries, can join the course."
  sec: 364
  time: '6:04'
  who: Erum
- line: "At Omdena we provide them the platform for the instructors and students.\
    \ Once they do the project, then they can do the course \u2013 they can be part\
    \ of the Omdena projects. Because with the passage of time, the [people\u2019\
    s] competency level increases. There are 1000 applications and we need only 60\
    \ people for one project and everyone wants to join. So this was also helping\
    \ us out \u2013 we are training the people, they already know the process and\
    \ they can join Omdena itself as a collaborator for projects."
  sec: 364
  time: '6:04'
  who: Erum
- line: "So was it more driven by necessity? When you saw that when people join projects\
    \ by Omdena, you saw that, more often than not, some of the participants (collaborators)\
    \ lacked some skills, so you thought \u201CHow about we create a course?\u201D"
  sec: 580
  time: '9:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "So they go through the course, and when they join the course, they already\
    \ know the basics. Or was it more the demand from the students (collaborators)\
    \ who said, \u201COkay, we want to take part, but we're struggling with these\
    \ areas, so we want to have a course about this before we continue.\u201D? Or\
    \ maybe both?"
  sec: 580
  time: '9:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Basically, it's not 100% aligned with the requirement. It's no doubt addressed\
    \ towards the skillset that is required for the projects as well. But we deliver\
    \ the course after the completion of a project. So it is not directly linked with\
    \ the project itself. It is just like\u2026 We have done one project at Omdena,\
    \ and we want to teach how Omdena works so people would be able to learn in that\
    \ way. So it is [a way to learn] for them and then they have an idea of how to\
    \ do projects in Omdena. So it is somehow linked with an upcoming project, but\
    \ not 100%. Whatever they have learned, they will replicate the learning. It's\
    \ not\u2026 It's just parallel, not like\u2026"
  sec: 619
  time: '10:19'
  who: Erum
- header: "Omdena\u2019s Community and Projects"
- line: "From what I understood from you, it was more about the platform and the community\
    \ \u2013 how exactly you interact with people. Did I understand it correctly?\
    \ Or were there courses like the basics of data science, I don't know\u2026 Pandas\
    \ Intro, NumPy Intro \u2013 things like that?"
  sec: 673
  time: '11:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "There are now courses on that as well. Because when we were growing \u2013\
    \ we started it in 2021 \u2013 and it's been more than three years, so we have\
    \ started these basic courses. But initially, it was not like that. It was [projects]\
    \ like developing a computer vision solution for vision-impaired people in Germany.\
    \ That was a project \u2013 people did that, and then we developed a course on\
    \ that, like \u201CHow can people detect transportation if they are visually impaired?\u201D\
    \ Then there were courses on natural language processing \u2013 how to prepare\
    \ students for interviews and assessing the abilities where they can do better.\
    \ So courses like that are there."
  sec: 692
  time: '11:32'
  who: Erum
- line: "Then there was agricultural reform through AI [projects]. So it was not [courses\
    \ that were] just the basic introduction to computer science. But eventually,\
    \ organizations started reaching out to them, like the Bhutan government (we are\
    \ delivering courses through the Bhutan government). They started asking us to\
    \ develop a structured course. Then we had to start with\u2026 We have our foundational\
    \ data science course, where we teach the introduction to all these skill sets,\
    \ like pandas, Python \u2013 and then bring them independently to an AI project."
  sec: 692
  time: '11:32'
  who: Erum
- line: "Maybe I\u2026 My impression from talking to you was that the courses\u2026\
    \ So when you said the courses usually started after the project, was it something\
    \ you learned from the project and then you tried to teach? So it was like, \u201C\
    Okay, now I learned [this]. I seem to understand this, but how can I understand\
    \ it even better?\u201D \u201CYes, you can do this by teaching. How about you\
    \ just teach what you just learned?\u201D Was that the idea?"
  sec: 792
  time: '13:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. You're right. It's just like that.
  sec: 820
  time: '13:40'
  who: Erum
- line: Uh-huh. Yeah, that's awesome.
  sec: 826
  time: '13:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 828
  time: '13:48'
  who: Erum
- line: "Because that's the best way to learn something. Because, at the beginning,\
    \ you think, \u201COkay, I think I get it.\u201D But then, when somebody asks\
    \ you to explain it, you start seeing the gaps in your understanding. Right?"
  sec: 828
  time: '13:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Then, when you go back and try to fill these gaps  \u2013 to understand them\
    \ \u2013 the best way of doing that is actually coming up with structured content,\
    \ like a course. And then you will quickly see all the gaps. And that was the\
    \ idea, right?"
  sec: 828
  time: '13:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. That was the idea.
  sec: 860
  time: '14:20'
  who: Erum
- header: Course Development and Structure at Omdena Academy
- line: And how do you decide what kind of content to teach, what kind of courses
    to [provide]?
  sec: 864
  time: '14:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Basically, I've been working and am still working as a facilitator. I also\
    \ teach a few courses. I decide how I should teach the course, basically. I have\
    \ a degree in computer science and I want to learn something new. So instead of\
    \ taking paid courses, I started learning and then made notes, and then I delivered\
    \ the course. Otherwise the content just [stays] with me \u2013 I'm not doing\
    \ anything with the content. I prepare the course on that and deliver it."
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Erum
- line: "And when I'm delivering, I'm learning, \u201COkay, I have to solve it because\
    \ I have to teach it.\u201D That's how I learn. But for how we are using the platform\
    \ is that people\u2026 We have a web page for registration, so collaborators from\
    \ the projects apply for the instructor [position], and then we review their content\
    \ and their course outline. Then, after having a few sessions on how we can change\
    \ it, how it could be more realistic, we create a page and start a normal course.\
    \ That's how it [usually goes]. It depends on the person who wants to deliver\
    \ a course."
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Erum
- line: "And the courses are free, right? Aren\u2019t they?"
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Free. Free for both actually \u2013 for the instructor and the students\
    \ as well. So you're not getting anything if you are teaching."
  sec: 952
  time: '15:52'
  who: Erum
- line: "This is how it works at DataTalks.Club as well \u2013 the courses are free\
    \ for everyone, including the instructors. But there is also beauty in that, when\
    \ the course is free \u2013 the reach is wider. So you can reach places and people,\
    \ you wouldn't be able to reach with a paid course. And this is amazing, right?"
  sec: 962
  time: '16:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "True that. That\u2026 I always talk to my CEO, like \u201CWe should sell\
    \ them.\u201D And he always says \u201CEducation is something we cannot earn.\
    \ We should not charge the students.\u201D We are charging the organizations because\
    \ they are already self-sustained, but the students we don't charge. It's free,\
    \ of course, for them to learn."
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Erum
- line: "You mentioned organizations, this is\u2026? You talked earlier about that\
    \ \u2013 when an organization approaches you and says, \u201CLook, you have this\
    \ foundational data science course, and we want you to teach this course at our\
    \ company. Can you come and do that?\u201D And you say, \u201CYes, but it will\
    \ not be free.\u201D Right?"
  sec: 1016
  time: '16:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's how we work.
  sec: 1039
  time: '17:19'
  who: Erum

  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: True.
  sec: 1045
  time: '17:25'
  who: Erum
- header: Student and Instructor Engagement
- line: Uh-huh. Interesting. Do I have to be in the Omdena community to join the course?
    Do I have to do a project first, for example?
  sec: 1046
  time: '17:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No. For an organization that wants just courses \u2013 we just develop courses\
    \ for them from the Omdena platform. All the organizational stuff is taken care\
    \ of by Omdena. From [the side of] Omdena Academy, our responsibility is developing\
    \ curriculum and content and stuff like that. So they don't necessarily need to\
    \ do the project. With companies, it goes the other way round \u2013 they do the\
    \ course and then the graduates have to do those projects. We do first with organizations,\
    \ and then we offer\u2026 sometimes we open a local chapter in that country and\
    \ whoever graduated, we ask them \u201CLet's do this project.\u201D It's not a\
    \ bottom-up approach."
  sec: 1058
  time: '17:38'
  who: Erum
- line: "It's interesting, my original question was a little bit different. But what\
    \ you said is \u2013 so let's say that this country (let's say Kenya) and there\
    \ is an organization that wants to have courses there. They don't have a project\
    \ yet \u2013 you first do a course with them, you upskill the people in this organization,\
    \ and then once they understand the basics of data science (for example), then\
    \ it's easier for you to say, \u201COkay, it looks like you have some problems\
    \ that we can help you address. Let's make a project.\u201D And then the students\
    \ who graduated from that course can already do the project. Right?"
  sec: 1113
  time: '18:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, that's how it works. Sometimes they give us the problem, sometimes\
    \ we also define \u201CThis is the problem in this region, let's solve this.\u201D\
    \ And we already have the capacity \u2013 and the people who have graduated can\
    \ join. Anyone else from outside is also welcome."
  sec: 1153
  time: '19:13'
  who: Erum
- line: "My original question was actually for the students. So let's say if I'm a\
    \ student \u2013 I have not heard about Omdena yet. I have not done any projects\
    \ with Omdena yet. But I came across a course that is interesting for me \u2013\
    \ let's say this foundational data science \u2013 and I think I want to take this\
    \ course. Can I do this or do I need to first do a project with Omdena or somehow\
    \ be associated with the community, or, I don't know, have a friend invite me\
    \ or something like that?"
  sec: 1172
  time: '19:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, sorry. I did not understand. Yeah, I got your question now. Yes. Basically,
    to join a course, you don't need to be part of Omdena. But to deliver a course,
    you need to be a part of the Omdena community. So anyone can join an Omdena course,
    but once you graduate, you become part of the Omdena community, and then you can
    join any project of your choice.
  sec: 1203
  time: '20:03'
  who: Erum
- line: "Uh-huh. I'm curious, how does it usually happen? Do people just come to you\
    \ and say, \u201CHey, I want to be an instructor.\u201D? Or do you have to proactively\
    \ look for instructors for certain topics? Or maybe it's a mixture [of both]?"
  sec: 1232
  time: '20:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: "So it's a mixture. We have\u2026 The link is open \u2013 every single time,\
    \ anyone can apply for the instructor [position] at any time. Sometimes, there\
    \ is a demand for a new topic and people ask if there is an interesting project\
    \ going on. We also reach out like this \u2013 the project is very interesting,\
    \ and then I ask a project team that is active and that would be willing to deliver\
    \ the course, \u201CWhy not make a course on this X challenger project?\u201D\
    \ It also works in two ways."
  sec: 1248

- line: "At DataTalks.Club, we also have free courses \u2013 I mentioned that. And\
    \ one of the courses just ended today. It was a data engineering course, and we\
    \ had 2,500 registrations (signups) and 350-roughly people graduated. This means\
    \ that the completion rate is slightly above 1% \u2013 it's 1.4%. So this is between\
    \ the people who signed up and those who actually ended up with certificates."
  sec: 1296
  time: '21:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: The course is tough, yes. So I understand that there's some sort of natural
    selection. But also, when a course is free, it doesn't cost you anything to just
    sign up and not show up at the end. Do you see something similar with the completion
    rates of your courses?
  sec: 1296
  time: '21:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. We are trying to engage more people and trying some engagement activities\
    \ as well. It\u2019s the same with us. Our courses are not recorded \u2013 those\
    \ are live courses and we also have like 400\u2013500 registrations, but eventually\
    \ we only invite 100 people. Because we have some capacity and also, financially,\
    \ we have capacity to deliver free courses to 100 students. The graduation rate\
    \ is 33%. Graduation means\u2026 It used to be, most of the time, 50\u201360 students\
    \ from the 100 are always active \u2013 they are joining courses and stuff like\
    \ that, but they are not able to do the project."
  sec: 1349
  time: '22:29'
  who: Erum
- line: "The competency or difficulty level is maybe a little high, or they are not\
    \ submitting assignments. For the graduation criteria, they have to submit a final\
    \ project and assessment. If they don't do that, they will not get a certificate\
    \ of participation. There are people who attend throughout but are not doing the\
    \ project. So it\u2019s like 30% on average. We can say that our graduation rate\
    \ is 30%."
  sec: 1349
  time: '22:29'
  who: Erum
- line: "This is quite cool. So what you do is also\u2026 In our case, this is just\
    \ natural selection \u2013 people who are not motivated or who don't have time\
    \ or have difficulties \u2013 they naturally drop out. In your case, you do some\
    \ pre-screening. You have 500 applications, but only 100 can join the course.\
    \ Right? What kind of criteria do you use, if it's not a secret? [I\u2019m asking]\
    \ to understand who joins."
  sec: 1429
  time: '23:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Basically, we have criteria for the course \u2013 there are prerequisites\
    \ and there is motivation. We always have one question, \u201CHow many hours can\
    \ you spend in one week to continue the course?\u201D This really helps us a lot\
    \ to do that. After completion, they get a free subscription to other learning\
    \ platforms as well. I think you don't mind [if I mention them] like DataCamp\
    \ or others \u2013 we have collaborations. We give free vouchers for that as well."
  sec: 1458
  time: '24:18'
  who: Erum

- line: Yes. I will just conclude that we are actually going for shortcuts as well.
    A few of my friends have a company and I sometimes help them evaluate resumes
    or tests. When you [look over] those tests, they are plagiarized. How can a company
    hire you when you are copying something from somewhere? We know that. We know
    the code, but we don't feel like typing it and doing the projects or tests on
    our own. So I think the more we have access to resources, the more we have become
    lazy.
