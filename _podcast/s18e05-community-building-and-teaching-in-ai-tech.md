  sec: 135
  time: '2:15'
  who: Erum
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks,
    Johanna, for your help. Let's start.
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Background: Journey from Pakistan to PhD & community teaching'
- line: Before we dive into community building, let's start with your background.
    Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 152
  time: '2:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm Erum from Pakistan. Currently, I'm based in Germany, as Alexey mentioned.
    I'm doing my PhD here. I come from a less-developed area of Pakistan where females
    are often not allowed to get an education. I'm lucky to have received an education,
    moved to the city, and started working with the community. Instead of just attending
    lessons, I began delivering workshops and courses.
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Erum
- line: Through various networks, I got my research position at Justus Liebig University
    in Giessen. I was involved in a project in Germany, which this university applied
    for and was selected. I mentored that project and suggested offering a PhD position.
    They agreed and offered it to me, so I joined.
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Erum
- line: Which city are you based in?
  sec: 275
  time: '4:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Giessen, near Frankfurt.
  sec: 277
  time: '4:37'
  who: Erum
- line: Okay, near Frankfurt.
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 285
  time: '4:45'
  who: Erum
- line: I've never been to that Frankfurt.
  sec: 286
  time: '4:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: You should visit sometime. [chuckles]
  sec: 290
  time: '4:50'
  who: Erum
- line: You work at Omdena. What's your title there?
  sec: 294
  time: '4:54'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Omdena Academy: Evolution from projects to structured courses'
- line: I'm currently Head of Omdena Academy. I started as a Lead Machine Learning
    Engineer, then we began delivering courses and transformed Omdena School into
    Omdena Academy.
  sec: 303
  time: '5:03'
  who: Erum
- line: It's amazing. It's unfortunate that women in your area can't get an education.
    It's fortunate you managed to do this. Hopefully, the situation changes. I'm interested
    to learn more about Omdena and your role there.
  sec: 328
  time: '5:28'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Omdena Projects: Global collaborators solving real‑world AI problems'
- line: Omdena is a global community that started in 2019. Every participant is called
    a "collaborator." We solve real-world challenges with AI. We started with a mental
    assistive application in 2019, then projects like finding anomalies on Mars. Our
    major learning is through diverse, global collaboration.
  sec: 364
  time: '6:04'
  who: Erum
- line: There are groups of 50-60 people from different backgrounds, learning together.
    We tackle projects with real-world datasets, which is rare in AI. Networking and
    learning from diverse perspectives are key. What do I do there?
  sec: 364
  time: '6:04'
  who: Erum
- line: I started as a collaborator on the first project. Later, I helped with graphics
    and certificates. We aimed to make AI and data science courses accessible to underdeveloped
    communities by building courses from our projects. This helps both the learners
    and instructors.
  sec: 364
  time: '6:04'
  who: Erum
- line: At Omdena, we provide a platform for instructors and students. After completing
    a project, participants can join courses and future projects. This training increases
    their competency and allows them to join Omdena as collaborators.
  sec: 364
  time: '6:04'
  who: Erum
- line: Was it driven by necessity when you saw participants lacking skills? Or was
    it a demand from students wanting to improve in specific areas?
  sec: 580
  time: '9:40'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Project-to-Course Model: Teaching skills learned from projects'
- line: It's not 100% aligned with requirements, but we address necessary skill sets.
    Courses are delivered after project completion to teach how Omdena works, giving
    people an idea of how to handle projects.
  sec: 619
  time: '10:19'
  who: Erum
- line: From what I understood, it's about the platform and community interaction.
    Are there courses on basic data science, like Pandas or NumPy?
  sec: 673
  time: '11:13'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Foundational Data Science Courses: Python, Pandas, NumPy, NLP'
- line: Yes, we now offer basic courses. Initially, it was project-based, like developing
    a solution for vision-impaired people in Germany. Now we have courses on natural
    language processing and interview preparation.
  sec: 692
  time: '11:32'
  who: Erum
- line: We also had agricultural AI projects. Initially, we focused on advanced projects,
    but eventually, we started foundational courses due to organizational demand.
    Now we have a foundational data science course covering basics like Pandas and
    Python.
  sec: 692
  time: '11:32'
  who: Erum
- line: When you said courses start after the project, is it to teach what was learned
    from the project? Like understanding better by teaching?
  sec: 792
  time: '13:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. You learn more by teaching and filling gaps in your understanding.
  sec: 820
  time: '13:40'
  who: Erum
- line: That's awesome.
  sec: 826
  time: '13:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that's the idea.
  sec: 860
  time: '14:20'
  who: Erum
- line: How do you decide what content to teach and what courses to offer?
  sec: 864
  time: '14:24'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Course Development: Instructor application, content review, delivery'
- line: I work as a facilitator and teach a few courses. I create courses based on
    my learning experiences. Instead of taking paid courses, I learn on my own, make
    notes, and then deliver the course. This way, I effectively use my knowledge.
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Erum
- line: When delivering, I learn more because I have to solve problems to teach them.
    We have a registration page where collaborators apply to be instructors. We review
    their content, make adjustments, and then launch the course.
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Erum
- line: And the courses are free, correct?
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Business Model: Free learner courses with organizational partnerships'
- line: Yes, free for both instructors and students. Instructors don't get paid.
  sec: 952
  time: '15:52'
  who: Erum
- line: This is how DataTalks.Club works too. Free courses mean wider reach, which
    is amazing, right?
  sec: 962
  time: '16:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: True. We often discuss selling courses, but my CEO believes education should
    be free for students. We charge organizations, not students.
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Erum
- line: When organizations ask for courses, you provide them for a fee, correct?
  sec: 1016
  time: '16:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that's how we work.
  sec: 1039
  time: '17:19'
  who: Erum
- line: That's the business model.
  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: True.
  sec: 1045
  time: '17:25'
  who: Erum
- line: Do I have to be in the Omdena community to join a course? Do I need to do
    a project first?
  sec: 1046
  time: '17:26'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Access Pathways: Enroll without prior Omdena membership; pathway to projects'
- line: No. Organizations can develop courses through Omdena without doing projects.
    For companies, courses come first, then projects. Graduates can join projects
    later.
  sec: 1058
  time: '17:38'
  who: Erum
- line: Let's say I'm a student interested in a foundational data science course.
    Can I join without being part of Omdena or a project?
  sec: 1172
  time: '19:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, you can join an Omdena course without being part of the community. Once
    you graduate, you become part of the Omdena community and can join any project.
  sec: 1203
  time: '20:03'
  who: Erum
- line: How do people usually become instructors? Do they approach you, or do you
    seek them out?
  sec: 1232
  time: '20:32'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Instructor Pipeline: Open applications and project-based recruitment'
- line: It's a mix. The link to apply as an instructor is always open. Sometimes,
    we reach out to interesting project teams and suggest creating a course on a specific
    topic.
  sec: 1248
  time: '20:48'
  who: Erum
- line: At DataTalks.Club, we have free courses with a low completion rate. Do you
    see something similar?
  sec: 1296
  time: '21:36'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Course Engagement: Live sessions, selection process, graduation rates'
- line: Yes. Our courses are live, not recorded. We invite 100 out of 400-500 registrants
    due to capacity and financial constraints. Our graduation rate is about 33%. Many
    attend but don't submit assignments, so they don't get a certificate.
  sec: 1349
  time: '22:29'
  who: Erum
- line: So, you do pre-screening to select participants. What criteria do you use?
  sec: 1429
  time: '23:49'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Selection & Motivation: Prereqs, availability, and incentive programs'
- line: We consider prerequisites, motivation, and availability. We also offer free
    subscriptions to learning platforms like DataCamp, which motivates participants.
  sec: 1458
  time: '24:18'
  who: Erum
- line: That's interesting. How do you see the connection between teaching and creating
    and maintaining a community?
  sec: 1522
  time: '25:22'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Roles & Responsibilities: Teaching focus vs community management'
- line: Creating the online community isn't my main role. We have a community manager
    and others who handle it. My focus is on teaching.
  sec: 1600
  time: '26:40'
  who: Erum
- line: You've been involved in various communities like Women Who Code and Neuromatch.
    What motivated you to take on leadership roles?
  sec: 1761
  time: '29:21'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Leadership Development: Network-building and taking initiative'
- line: For Omdena, I joined a project and met people who referred me to other opportunities.
    It was gradual. I took on leadership roles to stay connected with the community.
  sec: 1788
  time: '29:48'
  who: Erum
- line: The motivation was gradual. You built your network, and more opportunities
    appeared. Communities have frameworks for motivated individuals to take on roles.
  sec: 1858
  time: '30:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: True.
  sec: 1899
  time: '31:39'
  who: Erum
- line: As a community manager, I want to empower people to take initiative. How do
    you create an environment where people feel motivated to lead?
  sec: 1903
  time: '31:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Community Growth Strategy: Start small and scale (AI Wonder Girl example)'
- line: In our community, we built AI Wonder Girl, starting with seven-eight girls
    and growing to 100+. We meet online, discuss topics, and motivate each other.
    Starting small and gradually growing is key.
  sec: 1983
  time: '33:03'
  who: Erum
- line: Small groups meeting regularly to discuss and explore topics is effective.
    Don't start with big aims that seem unattainable. Begin with doable tasks.
  sec: 1983
  time: '33:03'
  who: Erum
- line: Like a small WhatsApp group.
  sec: 2133
  time: '35:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 2138
  time: '35:38'
  who: Erum

    to take initiative?
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Empowering Sub-communities: Regional chapters, branding, ethics'
- line: As a bigger organization, allowing people to use the community's name can
    help. It provides authenticity and reach. Ethical guidelines are important, but
    empowering people to represent the community is beneficial.
  sec: 2400
  time: '40:00'
  who: Erum
- line: WhatsApp groups are limited. A public page or social network can help people
    from the same region connect and represent the larger community.
  sec: 2400
  time: '40:00'
  who: Erum

  sec: 2555
  time: '42:35'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Boosting Attendance: Clear takeaways and live event value'
- line: Engagement and providing value are crucial. People need to know what they
    will gain from spending time in the community. Define clear takeaways for each
    session or activity.
  sec: 2570
  time: '42:50'
  who: Erum
- line: How to compete with Netflix? Show the value of attending meetups versus watching
    recorded content. People need to know they'll miss out if they don't attend.

  sec: 2994
  time: '49:54'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Hiring Integrity & Tools: Originality, plagiarism, and responsible ChatGPT
    use'
- line: Sometimes, job applicants use plagiarized tests. Companies can't hire people
    who don't show originality. The more access to resources we have, the lazier we've
    become.
  sec: 3056
  time: '50:56'
  who: Erum
- line: With ChatGPT, I'm so lazy now.
  sec: 3099
  time: '51:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 3101
  time: '51:41'
  who: Erum
