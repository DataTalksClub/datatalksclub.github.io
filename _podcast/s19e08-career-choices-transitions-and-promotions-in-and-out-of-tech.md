title: 'DevOps to Data Engineering: Automation, Open Source & Volunteering'
transcript:
- header: Podcast Introduction
- line: We have a special guest today, Agita. She has done a lot in her career, including
    work in DevOps, DataOps, data engineering, management, community building, education,
    and facilitation, among other things. I’m sure that’s not even the full list!
    She has experience in corporate environments, startups, open-source projects,
    and non-governmental sectors. She also founded an NGO focused on integrating expats
    and locals in Porto.

  who: Alexey
- line: Agita and I first connected a while back when she was at VMware. Later, we
    met in Porto during the Data Makers Fest. We even hosted a DataTalks.Club dinner,
    and our chat there was so interesting that I knew she had to be a guest on this
    podcast. Finally, here she is! Welcome, Agita.

  who: Alexey
- header: Guest Welcome & Interview Agenda
- line: Thank you! It’s great to be here.
  sec: 156
  time: '2:36'
  who: Agita
- line: The questions for today’s interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thank
    you, Johanna! Let’s dive in.
  sec: 159
  time: '2:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Before we get into the main topics like career transitions, promotions, and
    moving in and out of tech, can you start by telling us about your career journey
    so far?
  sec: 159
  time: '2:39'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Beginnings: Trade School, Web Design, First Programming'
- line: Sure. To make sense of it all, I created a little chronological timeline for
    myself.
  sec: 182
  time: '3:02'
  who: Agita
- line: After ninth grade, I went to trade school to study art and web design. I quickly
    realized I wasn’t very good at art, but during that time, I had my first experience
    with programming. That’s when I discovered I had a knack for it.
  sec: 182
  time: '3:02'
  who: Agita
- line: After finishing trade school, I couldn’t find a job as a designer, especially
    since I wasn’t particularly skilled at it. So, I worked as a waitress in Riga,
    Latvia, for a couple of years. At some point, I decided to pursue a bachelor’s
    degree in computer science, which felt like a spontaneous but exciting decision.
  sec: 182
  time: '3:02'
  who: Agita
- line: Was the trade school at a bachelor’s level?
  sec: 253
  time: '4:13'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Education & Bootcamp: Computer Science, Accenture, C++'
- line: No, it wasn’t. It was a vocational school. I completed my 12th-grade exams
    and earned a professional education in web design alongside them.
  sec: 255
  time: '4:15'
  who: Agita
- line: For my bachelor’s, I moved to another city and studied computer science. I
    loved it. After graduating, I joined a boot camp at Accenture, focusing on C++.
    C++ was my favorite language because I had an amazing teacher who significantly
    impacted my learning and career.
  sec: 255
  time: '4:15'
  who: Agita
- line: At the boot camp, I was the only woman among 22 participants. Of those, six
    were selected for internships, and I was one of them. That’s how I got into Accenture.
  sec: 255
  time: '4:15'
  who: Agita
- line: Was your first project in C++?
  sec: 319
  time: '5:19'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Transition to DevOps: Configuration Management & Early Automation'
- line: Actually, no. My first project was in Python, which felt easier in comparison.
    I worked as an intern for Nokia for six months, but then Nokia experienced major
    financial challenges and shut down the project.
  sec: 322
  time: '5:22'
  who: Agita
- line: This meant that the 60 people involved were reassigned. All the interns, including
    me, were moved to a newly emerging area called DevOps. At the time, it was still
    referred to as configuration management.
  sec: 322
  time: '5:22'
  who: Agita
- line: We were a small team working in what felt like a basement, automating tasks.
    DevOps was still in its infancy, but within a couple of years, it grew significantly.
    By then, we had our own office and a team of over 100 people.
  sec: 322
  time: '5:22'
  who: Agita
- header: 'Burnout and Self-Discovery: Travel and Volunteerism'
- line: Eventually, I burned out. Despite an offer for another promotion, I couldn’t
    continue. I realized no amount of money could convince me to stay.
  sec: 377
  time: '6:17'
  who: I worked on two main projects during that time. The first earned me a promotion,
    and the second involved four years of extensive travel to Germany. I worked on-site
    every Monday through Thursday. My responsibilities grew to include leading a team,
    supporting project managers, and working closely with clients.
- line: To recover, I went on a self-discovery journey to Bulgaria. There, I volunteered
    for Erasmus Plus, which was my first introduction to that program and the world
    of facilitation.
  sec: 377
  time: '6:17'
  who: I worked on two main projects during that time. The first earned me a promotion,
    and the second involved four years of extensive travel to Germany. I worked on-site
    every Monday through Thursday. My responsibilities grew to include leading a team,
    supporting project managers, and working closely with clients.
- line: What is Erasmus Plus? Is it like a master’s degree program?
  sec: 452
  time: '7:32'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Erasmus+ Volunteering: Programs, Exchanges, and Training'
- line: Not exactly. Erasmus Plus is a program for young people to travel and engage
    in educational activities. These trips are typically shorter around 10 days and
    focus on learning and cultural exchange.
  sec: 456
  time: '7:36'
  who: Agita
- line: It's not really a big thing.
  sec: 469
  time: '7:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it's not long. Usually, it's something very short.
  sec: 472
  time: '7:52'
  who: Agita
- line: There are many Erasmus programs. The usual Erasmus is when you're doing your
    Bachelor’s, and you can spend a semester abroad. Then there’s Erasmus Mundus,
    which I participated in. It’s more like a master’s program where you study in
    multiple universities. Now there’s also Erasmus Plus, and I’ve heard of other
    Erasmus initiatives as well.
  sec: 477
  time: '7:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, there are many. I don’t even know all of them. For sure, there are youth
    exchanges for younger people, training courses for educators, and volunteering
    programs where you can help on-site for a month. I discovered this just as I was
    turning 30, which is the age limit for many of these opportunities. I found out
    just in time to join.
  sec: 498
  time: '8:18'
  who: Agita
- line: I spent a year volunteering, coordinating Erasmus Plus projects. After that,
    I continued volunteering and stayed in Bulgaria. I’m not even sure where my money
    was coming from during that time. Looking back, I lived quite comfortably for
    three years, all while volunteering. I just couldn’t make myself return to IT
    or any other job.
  sec: 498
  time: '8:18'
  who: Agita
- line: So, you’re not sure how you managed to survive financially during those years?
  sec: 549
  time: '9:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: There was always money somehow.
  sec: 555
  time: '9:15'
  who: Agita
- line: I wish that were always the case!
  sec: 557
  time: '9:17'
  who: Alexey
- header: Community Management at VMware & Versatile Data Kit (Open Source)
- line: At some point, my friends offered me a job as a community manager at a co-working
    space called Networking Premium. That experience was really important for my CV.
    It later helped me land a position with VMware.
  sec: 560
  time: '9:20'
  who: Agita
- line: VMware was looking for someone with a technical background and community management
    experience. They found me while I was planning to move to Portugal. They managed
    to hire me there, and I worked on an open-source project called Versatile Data
    Kit. My role involved community management, traveling for conferences, and more.
  sec: 560
  time: '9:20'
  who: Agita
- line: Eventually, VMware was sold, and they let go of everyone working in Portugalit
    was just a team of eight people. Honestly, getting laid off was the perfect scenario
    for me.
  sec: 560
  time: '9:20'
  who: Agita
- line: While working there, I also became a certified facilitator and started facilitating
    Erasmus Plus projects during my free time. After I was let go in March, I opened
    an NGO focused on inclusion through Erasmus Plus projects and began working on
    local initiatives in Porto. In January, I’m starting a mentorship program for
    teenagers aged 10 to 16 to help them with career choices.
  sec: 560
  time: '9:20'
  who: Agita
- line: Your story is amazing and inspiring. While listening, I was thinking of different
    titles for this interview. Maybe "From Waitress to DevOps Lead" or "From Waitress
    to Community Manager"? But it’s hard to pick because you’ve done so many different
    things. You seem to really enjoy volunteering with Erasmus Plus. You’re still
    involved with it, right?
  sec: 683
  time: '11:23'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Testing Passions: Flow, Energy, and Career Fit'
- line: Yes, I’m still doing it because it feels natural. I often test things to see
    if I’m good at them. For example, I tried art and found it wasn’t for me, but
    programming was. Facilitation seems to be a good fit too, as people keep inviting
    me to do it. I base my journey on where the energy feels right.
  sec: 717
  time: '11:57'
  who: Agita
- line: What do you mean by “where the energy feels right”? How do you test that?
  sec: 749
  time: '12:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s simple. I ask myself, do I like this? Am I good at it? If the answer
    is yes, I’ll enjoy doing it. If time flies while I’m working on something, that’s
    a sign it’s the right thing for me.
  sec: 761
  time: '12:41'
  who: Agita
- line: That sounds like being in the flow.
  sec: 788
  time: '13:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. There’s a whole theory about flow.
  sec: 792
  time: '13:12'
  who: Agita
- line: But you’re not always good at something when you first start, right?
  sec: 795
  time: '13:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: True, but sometimes I surprise myself. For example, when I started programming,
    I discovered I had a natural aptitude for it. I remember my teacher gave us a
    task to calculate something and left the room, saying whoever solved it would
    get the highest grade. I was the only one who figured it out. That’s when I realized
    I was good at programming.
  sec: 801
  time: '13:21'
  who: Agita
- line: What kind of problem was it?
  sec: 838
  time: '13:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'It was simple: we had to calculate a sequence of numbers and find the 1,000th
    term. It required writing a basic loop. While it wasn’t difficult, I was the only
    one who solved it.'
  sec: 840
  time: '14:00'
  who: Agita
- line: That’s impressive!
  sec: 866
  time: '14:26'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Automation Case Study: Scripting Repetitive Tasks and Rapid Promotion'
- line: Speaking of your LinkedIn, you mentioned automating yourself out of a project
    and getting a promotion for it. Can you share more about that?
  sec: 869
  time: '14:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. My first project at Accenture involved a repetitive task. On my first
    day, they gave me seven printed pages of instructions for migrating files updating
    some, testing others on Linux and Windows, and so on.
  sec: 902
  time: '15:02'
  who: Agita
- line: For the first two days, I followed the instructions manually. By the end of
    the week, I realized how repetitive it was and how prone it was to human error.
    For example, copying and renaming folders could easily go wrong. I thought, “This
    can be automated.”
  sec: 902
  time: '15:02'
  who: Agita
- line: It took some time to write the automation scripts, which made me fall behind
    initially. But once everything was automated, the process became error-free and
    efficient. Piece by piece, I automated the entire workflow. If something can be
    written as instructions on paper, it can usually be written as code.
  sec: 902
  time: '15:02'
  who: Agita
- line: Did they expect you to automate the process?
  sec: 1004
  time: '16:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not at all. By the end of three months, the whole process was automated. It
    was surprising for everyone, but it worked perfectly!
  sec: 1005
  time: '16:45'
  who: Agita
- line: Your first job...
  sec: 1009
  time: '16:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, my first position was like a junior engineer or something similar.
  sec: 1010
  time: '16:50'
  who: Agita
- line: Exactly, it was like getting a foot in the door. I think there were projects
    where people were doing repetitive daily tasks. After about three months, I had
    automated most of it and had nothing left to do. The team was impressed and decided
    to keep me on for another month, but there was still nothing left to fix or improve.
  sec: 1014
  time: '16:54'
  who: Agita
- line: They had a performance evaluation system where you set your own goals and
    then got evaluated. I received an "above expectations" rating for every criterion.
    Typically, promotions came after at least a year of work, but in my case, it took
    only five months. The technical lead even wrote to my career counselor to ensure
    I completed some learning tasks before officially getting promoted. So, less than
    a year in, I was already promoted.
  sec: 1014
  time: '16:54'
  who: Agita
- line: When you mentioned spring migration, it gave me flashbacks. I used to be a
    Java developer, and back then, we didn’t have support engineers to automate things
    like this. I had to handle it myself. Did you work with Java too?
  sec: 1091
  time: '18:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not really. I never properly learned Java. I find it very difficult. I even
    tried taking a course in Java during that project, but it just wasn’t for me.
    Instead, I used scripts and tools that didn’t require me to actually write Java
    code. I didn’t need to know the language to work on the project.
  sec: 1115
  time: '18:35'
  who: Agita
- line: As a DevOps engineer or platform engineer, do you think it’s necessary to
    know the programming language used in the systems you support?
  sec: 1140
  time: '19:00'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Problem-Solving as a Core Skill: Transferable Technical Competencies'
- line: Not at all. Sometimes I didn’t even know the language a tool or framework
    was built with. At one point, I worked with Ruby and had to learn it on the go.
    As you said, after learning C++, everything else seems possible. Once you understand
    the fundamentals, you can use any language or tool to solve problems. I realized
    that my core skill is problem-solving, and the tools or languages are just means
    to achieve the goal.
  sec: 1156
  time: '19:16'
  who: Agita
- line: Problem-solving is often listed as a required skill in job descriptions, but
    what does it really mean? How can someone prove they are a good problem solver?
  sec: 1203
  time: '20:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s a good question. For me, I enjoy challenges, which might explain why
    I solve problems effectively.
  sec: 1222
  time: '20:22'
  who: Agita
- line: So you see problems more as challenges than as actual problems?
  sec: 1235
  time: '20:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 1239
  time: '20:39'
  who: Agita
- line: You mentioned burning out in DevOps and deciding you couldn’t do it anymore,
    no matter the money. Then you turned to volunteering. What skills from your DevOps
    experience were most useful during that transition?
  sec: 1241
  time: '20:41'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Applying Corporate Processes to NGOs: Documentation & Agile Practices'
- line: My corporate experience, in general, taught me professionalism, understanding
    processes, and the importance of documentation. In NGOs, people often work chaotically
    without structured processes.
  sec: 1263
  time: '21:03'
  who: Agita
- line: When I joined an NGO, I introduced systems like ticketing, documentation,
    and agile processes. These organizational skillslike retrospectives, planning,
    and problem-solvingare incredibly valuable in any context.
  sec: 1263
  time: '21:03'
  who: Agita
- line: So, essentially, you applied your organizational and project management skills
    to structure and solve problems.
  sec: 1319
  time: '21:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. For example, I joined the Open Bulgaria project, which was completely
    new and volunteer-based. We created a website for foreigners living or moving
    to Bulgaria. I used all my skills to establish a sustainable system for managing
    the project, from volunteers writing articles to creating workflows.
  sec: 1335
  time: '22:15'
  who: Agita
- line: Were these projects mostly technical, or did they involve other types of work?
  sec: 1380
  time: '23:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was a mix. For example, while I wasn’t directly programming, I worked with
    a team to manage and support content creation.
  sec: 1391
  time: '23:11'
  who: Agita
- line: Managing volunteers is different from managing employees, isn’t it?
  sec: 1408
  time: '23:28'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Volunteer Management vs. Employment: Motivation and Process Design'
- line: Yes, very different. Volunteers don’t have to be there, so it’s all about
    motivation. You need to inspire them to believe in the project and dedicate their
    free time to it. Open source projects are similarthey rely entirely on motivated
    volunteers.
  sec: 1435
  time: '23:55'
  who: Agita
- line: When managing volunteers, you’re not really their "manager," right?
  sec: 1477
  time: '24:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. It’s more about providing structure. Volunteers pick tasks at their
    own pace, complete them, and then an editor or reviewer checks their work. The
    key is to create a smooth process.
  sec: 1489
  time: '24:49'
  who: Agita
- header: 'Spotting Opportunities: Transitioning into Volunteer Roles'
- line: If someone wanted to transition to a volunteer role, like you did, how would
    they go about it?
  sec: 1507
  time: '25:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it was about recognizing opportunities. I found the NGO role through
    an expat group. I tend to spot opportunities and act on them. It’s about being
    open to possibilities and trusting your intuition.
  sec: 1520
  time: '25:20'
  who: Agita
- line: You mentioned personality types. Are those the four-letter codes like introvert/extrovert
    and so on?
  sec: 1579
  time: '26:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, those are based on traits like introversion, extroversion, sensing, feeling,
    and so on.
  sec: 1595
  time: '26:35'
  who: Agita
- line: Do you think knowing your personality type is helpful?
  sec: 1603
  time: '26:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: Personality Types & Team Composition (MBTI relevance)
- line: Yes, it can be. Some companies even use personality typing to build balanced
    teams. For example, combining introverts and extroverts can improve team dynamics.
    Knowing your personality type also fosters self-awareness, which is always valuable.
  sec: 1610
  time: '26:50'
  who: Agita
- line: For me, personality tests feel more like a fun activity. We once did this
    during a team-building event, but I didn’t see any practical changes afterward.
  sec: 1665
  time: '27:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: It might not change much directly, but it can build empathy. It helps you
    understand that not everyone thinks or operates the same way you do. For example,
    I’m very spontaneous, but I’ve learned to respect people who prefer detailed planning.
  sec: 1725
  time: '28:45'
  who: Agita
- line: You wrote an article about the personality traits best suited for data engineering.
    What are those traits?
  sec: 1782
  time: '29:42'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Personality Traits for Data Engineering: Precision, Persistence, Detail'
- line: From my experience, data engineers need to be detail-oriented, persistent,
    and precise. They must enjoy working with data to uncover insights and make decisions.
  sec: 1793
  time: '29:53'
  who: Agita
- line: Personally, I’m more intuitive and spontaneous, so I don’t excel in roles
    requiring high levels of precision. For example, when I worked on community statistics,
    I loved creating charts and seeing the results. But if something wasn’t working,
    I struggled to go back and fix it. Persistence and attention to detail are crucial
    for data engineering.
  sec: 1793
  time: '29:53'
  who: Agita
- line: It sounds like you enjoy creating something new, but maintaining it is less
    enjoyable for you.
  sec: 1912
  time: '31:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely not enjoyable. It's just a pain.
  sec: 1918
  time: '31:58'
  who: Agita
- line: There are people who feel the opposite way, though.
  sec: 1922
  time: '32:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, definitely. Some people truly enjoy perfecting systems. They love creating
    systems that function seamlessly, covering every detail that might be necessary.
    They aim for perfection, and their perfectionism can be a huge asset to a team.
    When someone is naturally detail-oriented and driven, they bring incredible value.
  sec: 1926
  time: '32:06'
  who: Agita
- line: Would you say that a back-end engineer working in Java or Python and a data
    engineer need different personality types for their work? Or is personality not
    that crucial?
  sec: 1961
  time: '32:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe it's not as important, but I think there are differences. Engineers
    often share similar traits, but the key difference lies in their interests. What
    excites them? What do they spend their free time exploring?
  sec: 1980
  time: '33:00'
  who: Agita
- line: For instance, I had a friend at Accenture who spent his workday programming,
    then went home and researched IT security conferences. It was clear that he was
    deeply passionate about security. When someone dedicates their free time to something
    like this, it signals their potential to excel in that area.
  sec: 1980
  time: '33:00'
  who: Agita
- line: That makes sense. I’ve been reflecting on my own career while discussing this.
    I started as a Java developer and then transitioned to data science. However,
    I never fully embraced the analytical side of data science.
  sec: 2040
  time: '34:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Many data scientists love analyzing data, experimenting, and building the
    best models. For me, the engineering side was more appealing. Even though I had
    the title of data scientist, I didn’t enjoy digging into data or optimizing models.
    I was more interested in figuring out how to deploy and integrate them. Maybe
    it’s because my personality leans more toward engineering than research.
  sec: 2040
  time: '34:00'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Data Scientist vs. Data Engineer: Interests and Role Differences'
- line: That aligns with what I’ve read. There are two types of people in these roles.
    One type is logical and opportunistic they see opportunities and know where to
    apply solutions. The other type is more rational and analytical, diving deep into
    data and analysis.
  sec: 2092
  time: '34:52'
  who: Agita
- line: Both types can excel in data engineering or similar fields. When I wrote my
    article about this, I actually asked my colleagues to take a personality test.
    Most of them fit into one of these two categories. My observations and the article
    were based on real experiences working with a data engineering team and a development

  who: Agita
- line: This was during your time at VMware as a community manager, right?
  sec: 2151
  time: '35:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. I loved working with those people.
  sec: 2155
  time: '35:55'
  who: Agita
- line: After VMware, where you worked as a community manager, there was a gap of
    about three years when you focused on volunteering. Was it difficult to return
    to the corporate world after that?
  sec: 2160
  time: '36:00'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Returning to Corporate via Open Source: Community + Technical Work'
- line: Not really. I had set criteria for myselfI’d only take a role if it was open
    source. Luckily, the project that hired me was open source. They onboarded me
    into a role that involved both community work and technical contributions.
  sec: 2185
  time: '36:25'
  who: Agita
- line: I realized that while I’m technically skilled, I enjoy working with people
    even more. Managing teams, solving people-related problems, and building communities
    are much more fulfilling for me. My transition back into a corporate environment
    felt natural and aligned with my interests.
  sec: 2185
  time: '36:25'
  who: Agita
- line: What does being a community manager entail? I consider myself one as well,
    but it seems like the role can vary a lot. Two people might have the same title
    but completely different responsibilities.
  sec: 2256
  time: '37:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s true.
  sec: 2279
  time: '37:59'
  who: Agita
- line: What did your role as a community manager involve?
  sec: 2280
  time: '38:00'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Community Manager Role: Content, DevRel Overlap, and Events'
- line: A big part of it was social media, which I didn’t expect. When I think about
    community management, I imagine bringing people together, fostering team-building,
    and improving communication.
  sec: 2285
  time: '38:05'
  who: Agita
- line: But in practice, a lot of my work involved creating content for LinkedIn,
    Twitter, Meetup, and Facebook. I also wrote blogs and hosted monthly YouTube community
    meetings. Communication was key, but content creation dominated the role.
  sec: 2285
  time: '38:05'
  who: Agita
- line: It sounds similar to a developer relations position.
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. A guest once told me that what I was doing aligned with developer
    relations (DevRel). She even suggested that I should pursue a DevRel role because
    it might come with a better salary.
  sec: 2359
  time: '39:19'
  who: Agita
- line: So it was less about community building and more about marketing activities
    to promote the open-source project, right?
  sec: 2407
  time: '40:07'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Product Focus: Simplifying Vision and Goal-Setting'
- line: Yes, but there were still community interactions. For example, I participated
    in community meetings, spoke at conferences, and facilitated on-site team-building
    sessions.
  sec: 2423
  time: '40:23'
  who: Agita
- line: One of my favorite experiences was leading a goal-setting process with my
    team. At one point, we realized that we were adding too many features to our product,
    making it hard to use. We had to refocus and simplify.
  sec: 2423
  time: '40:23'
  who: Agita
- line: 'During this process, we aligned on a vision: we wanted the product to feel
    "easy." It was incredibly rewarding to guide the team through this and see how
    it brought clarity to our work.'
  sec: 2423
  time: '40:23'
  who: Agita
- line: I think this is more for comparison. I also prefer to call myself a community
    manager. It mostly involves organizing things, like what we’re doing right now.
    Even though Hanna prepared the questions, I reached out to her and set up the
    date. It’s about organizing different activities in the community, courses, and
    similar events. I wouldn’t call it product or project management, though. It's
    more about bringing together a group of people who are interested in doing various
    things. The goal is to figure out how we can engage them and create activities
    they enjoy.
  sec: 2486
  time: '41:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I think people want to be together and to do things together. When
    those activities are meaningful, they attract more people. In my NGO, I’m also
    realizing that it’s just a great excuse to come together and accomplish something.
  sec: 2530
  time: '42:10'
  who: Agita
- line: Tell us more about that. What are you doing in your NGO? How did this decision
    come about? Was it in May or March when VMware made the decision to let you go?
    Now it's December, so what happened? How did you decide to start an NGO, and why
    this particular type of NGO and activity?
  sec: 2555
  time: '42:35'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Coaching Course: "Align Your Career With Who You Are"'
- line: Starting an NGO is not easy, at least not in Portugal. I’m not sure how it
    works in other countries, but you need at least nine people. It didn’t really
    start in March. I had already been doing a career coaching course for about two
    years, but with a friend. We were facilitating these two-day courses, guiding
    people through processes and methods to help them align their careers with who
    they are. The course was called "Align Your Career With Who You Are." We used
    specific methods and tools to help people understand their next steps by the end
    of the two days.
  sec: 2584
  time: '43:04'
  who: Agita
- line: Were you learning how to be a career coach, or were you being coached by someone?
  sec: 2614
  time: '43:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was leading the course with this guest therapist, the same person I mentioned
    earlier. We were facilitating people through a process to help them understand
    their career moves. The idea was to help people align their careers with their
    passions, skills, and energy flow.
  sec: 2621
  time: '43:41'
  who: Agita
- line: So, if I had just graduated, had no idea what to do, and my parents were telling
    me to either study medicine or go into IT, but neither option felt right, would
    this kind of course help me figure out what to do?
  sec: 2662
  time: '44:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that’s the best-case scenario. People sometimes join the course when
    they’re burned out or hate their current job. Others join when they’re ready for
    a career change because they can’t continue the way things are. In the course,
    we met several people who shared similar goals. We were all interested in inclusion,
    Erasmus+ projects, and event creation. Gradually, we formed a little community.
    It wasn’t intentionality that just happened. We met these nine people and wanted
    to do something bigger.
  sec: 2681
  time: '44:41'
  who: Agita
- line: How did the decision to start an NGO come about?
  sec: 2697
  time: '44:57'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Founding an NGO: Legal Setup, Governance, and Launch'
- line: In May, we went through the process of establishing the NGO. We needed to
    get a Portuguese person who understood the legal aspects of starting an NGO. We
    also had to find people willing to take on roles like treasurer and president.
    It was a lot of work, and the preparation was difficult. It took about six months
    to go through all the paperwork and write the regulations. But now, it’s all done.
    The process began when we met people at different events we were involved in,
    like the ones I did with Julia, the girl I’m working with.
  sec: 2704
  time: '45:04'
  who: Agita
- line: So, your NGO focuses on gender equality. What does "inclusion" mean in your
    context? Is it about making expats feel more included?
  sec: 2803
  time: '46:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Inclusion in Porto: Connecting Expats and Locals'
- line: Yes, exactly. In Portugal, I’ve noticed there’s a divide. Expats tend to hang
    out only with other expats, and it’s difficult to meet locals. I think that happens
    in many countries.
  sec: 2812
  time: '46:52'
  who: Agita
- line: I can relate to that. In Germany, I mostly hang out in my own bubble, and
    it usually doesn’t include Germans.
  sec: 2828
  time: '47:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly! That’s the case here too. We want to create events or spaces where
    locals can join and meet expats. There’s a stereotype that foreigners drive up
    apartment prices by renting expensive places, so they’re often seen as the "bad
    guys." But when you get to know people, you realize their motivations. Every person
    here contributes something valuable to the community. Communication between locals
    and expats is essential to improve mutual understanding.
  sec: 2838
  time: '47:18'
  who: Agita
- line: So that’s inclusion. And the last part was sustainability?
  sec: 2890
  time: '48:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, sustainability is part of our plan, but we’re not doing much with it
    yet. We’re still figuring out how it will evolve.
  sec: 2894
  time: '48:14'
  who: Agita
- line: What does it look like in practical terms? If I were an expat and came across
    your community in Porto, what would I get from it?
  sec: 2904
  time: '48:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can join an event through Meetup. If you like it, you can stick around
    and become a member. We’re currently recruiting assembly members, not board members,
    but people who will help us make decisions about the direction of the NGO.
  sec: 2918
  time: '48:38'
  who: Agita
- line: What kind of activities do you do at the meetups?
  sec: 2949
  time: '49:09'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Meetup Activities: MBTI, Improv, and Community Events'
- line: We do all sorts of things. Each of us has a different skill set. One person
    does improv theater, another is from the US and teaches MBTI and storytelling.
    I focus on community building. We each lead different events, and that’s how we
    offer a variety of activities.
  sec: 2952
  time: '49:12'
  who: Agita
- line: What is MBTI?
  sec: 2969
  time: '49:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: MBTI stands for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. It’s a personality typing
    system based on 16 personality types.
  sec: 2972
  time: '49:32'
  who: Agita
- line: So, it’s similar to the four-letter personality types we talked about before?
  sec: 2976
  time: '49:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. Then there’s another person who does guest-style theater. We
    just offer these events, and if people like them, they stick around.
  sec: 2980
  time: '49:40'
  who: Agita
- line: So, when I attend, do people announce their skills and interests?
  sec: 2997
  time: '49:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. When there’s something interesting happening, people want to stick
    around. That’s how we grew from two to nine members, and now we’re up to 10, 11,
    or 12. It’s a physical, local community, so it’s not online at all.
  sec: 3005
  time: '50:05'
  who: Agita
- line: So it’s not related to IT in any way?
  sec: 3035
  time: '50:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not at all.
  sec: 3041
  time: '50:41'
  who: Agita
- line: I imagine many expats are developers, at least in Germany, based on my own
    bias. If I meet someone from Russia who speaks Russian, they’re often in IT or
    development.
  sec: 3043
  time: '50:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: In my experience, this is the case as well.
  sec: 3067
  time: '51:07'
  who: Agita
- line: For us, it's easier to move around. All you need is a laptop, right?
  sec: 3070
  time: '51:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: I see.
  sec: 3076
  time: '51:16'
  who: Agita
- line: You mentioned that the image of a foreigner, particularly in IT, is often
    associated with having a good income. They come to places like Porto, rent expensive
    apartments, and drive up prices. Locals may not necessarily appreciate that.
  sec: 3079
  time: '51:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I think it's due to the lack of direct contact. People see the prices
    rising and assume someone must be responsible for it.
  sec: 3100
  time: '51:40'
  who: Agita
- line: You don’t live in Porto, right? Do you live outside the city?
  sec: 3115
  time: '51:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I live a bit outside Porto.
  sec: 3119
  time: '51:59'

  sec: 3124
  time: '52:04'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Off-Grid Living Experiment: Land, Dome, and Lifestyle Shift'
- line: Yes, that’s right. Thanks to VMware and my layoff, I managed to buy a piece
    of land in a forest. I built a dome there, and I’ve completely moved in. I’ve
    closed all other options I had in Porto, so I’m now fully living off the grid
    in the forest.
  sec: 3131
  time: '52:11'
  who: Agita
- line: So, you're living in the forest now?
  sec: 3162
  time: '52:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, right now, I’m in France because I was worried about the internet connection.
    But I usually have all my calls from there.
  sec: 3164
  time: '52:44'
  who: Agita
- line: How is the internet connection usually?
  sec: 3173
  time: '52:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s actually fine. I might have been overly cautious about it. It’s better
    to be safe than sorry, but I usually have no issues with calls.
  sec: 3177
  time: '52:57'
  who: Agita
- line: Living off the grid means you need to produce your own electricity, get your
    own water, and manage waste. How do you handle all of that?
  sec: 3193
  time: '53:13'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Off-Grid Utilities: Solar Power, Rainwater, and Well Plans'
- line: Exactly. The electricity part is done with solar panels and batteries. For
    water, I’m in the process of installing a rainwater collector, which I can filter
    and use. I’ve also drilled a well, but I need to go through some legal processes
    for that.
  sec: 3207
  time: '53:27'
  who: Agita
- line: Sounds like a big project.
  sec: 3240
  time: '54:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it’s a long-term life project.
  sec: 3243
  time: '54:03'
  who: Agita
- line: Do you encounter wild animals there?
  sec: 3249
  time: '54:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’ve seen insects, slugs, and a lizard. I’ve also spotted a snake, but nothing
    too large. Occasionally, I see a squirrel pass by, but there aren’t many animals
    around.
  sec: 3256
  time: '54:16'
  who: Agita
- line: Even in the city, I’ve seen animals. In Berlin, I don’t see lizards, but in
    France and Italy, they’re everywhere.
  sec: 3278
  time: '54:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I’ve only seen one lizard. I really like lizards.
  sec: 3288
  time: '54:48'
  who: Agita
- line: That’s impressive. I remember you mentioned living off the grid at dinner,
    and I thought, “Wow, that’s brave.”
  sec: 3296
  time: '54:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s an experiment. Life is an experiment, and I want to see how it goes.
    If it doesn’t work, I can always change my mind, sell the property, or upgrade.
    For now, I’m focused on living with the bare minimum and seeing if I can live
    comfortably that way. It will be an interesting journey, especially this winter.
  sec: 3308
  time: '55:08'
  who: Agita
- header: 'Cost Comparison: Off-Grid Life vs. Porto Renting'
- line: In terms of money, is it cheaper than renting an apartment in Porto? I’ve
    heard that Porto has become quite expensive.
  sec: 3352
  time: '55:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, Porto is expensive. I was paying around 550 for a room, including everything.
    Here, I’m paying about 300, though I’m also covering gas, which I would likely
    be paying for anyway.
  sec: 3361
  time: '56:01'
  who: Agita
- line: I think we have time for one more question. We haven’t covered everything,
    but there’s one thing I really wanted to ask. You posted about a “brainstorming
    party” on LinkedIn. What does that look like?
  sec: 3379
  time: '56:19'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Unemployment Party: Mastermind Brainstorming Technique'
- line: It was actually my unemployment party.
  sec: 3407
  time: '56:47'
  who: Agita
- line: Unemployment party, okay.
  sec: 3411
  time: '56:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, when I got laid off, I realized I needed to apply my own methods to myself.
    In my course, we usually work with people’s core values and go through six logical
    levels to help them define their life’s purpose. I also use a mastermind technique
    where people brainstorm for one person. I told my friends my situation being unemployed,
    living in a forest, and so on and asked them, “What would you do if you were in
    my position?” It’s important to phrase it that way because it makes people think
    from their perspective, and that leads to really helpful ideas. Everyone writes
    their ideas on sticky notes, and I get a lot of input on possible options. It
    was incredibly useful, and I ended up facilitating similar mastermind groups afterward.
  sec: 3412
  time: '56:52'
  who: Agita
- line: That’s amazing. The concept of an unemployment party is so cool! How did you
    come up with it? It’s not something you just wake up and think, “I want to throw
    an unemployment party today.”
  sec: 3547
  time: '59:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Well, first, I really was unemployed. I had just quit my job or been laid
    off. I realized I needed to hear from my trusted friends and get their ideas.
    I usually create spaces for others to brainstorm, and this time, I needed to apply
    that to myself. So, I gathered my friends and called it a party. It was a logical
    sequence: I’m unemployed, I need help, so let’s gather and brainstorm.'
  sec: 3577
  time: '59:37'
  who: Agita
- line: Did you have traditional party aspects, like food?
  sec: 3631
  time: '1:00:31'

    and I shared my whole story from when I first arrived in Porto up until that moment.

description: 'Learn DevOps-to-Data-Engineering career tactics: automation, open source
  & volunteering to build skills, earn rapid promotions, and lead projects.'
intro: How do you move from DevOps into data engineering while using automation, open
  source contributions, and volunteering to shape your career? In this episode Agita
  Jaunzeme — a DevOps/DataOps engineer, community manager, educator and NGO founder
  focused on inclusion in Porto — walks through that exact path. <br><br> We trace
  her journey from trade school and early programming to configuration management
  and rapid promotion through scripting repetitive tasks, then into burnout, Erasmus+
  volunteering, and community work at VMware. Key topics include automation case studies,
  building and contributing to open source (Versatile Data Kit), applying corporate
  processes and agile documentation to NGOs, volunteer management versus employment,
  spotting volunteer-to-career opportunities, and the practical differences between
  data scientists and data engineers. We also cover community management, career coaching,
  founding an NGO, meetup activities, and even an off-grid living experiment. <br><br>
  Listen for actionable guidance on automation best practices, how open source community
  work can reopen corporate doors, designing volunteer processes, and aligning technical
  career moves with personal values — practical takeaways for anyone navigating a
  career pivot into data engineering or community-driven tech work.
