title: Doing Software Engineering in Academia
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about doing software engineering in academia. We have
    a special guest today, Johanna. Johanna has a formal background in psychology
    and computational neuroscience. She's now about to complete her PhD in the field
    of machine learning in clinical neuroimaging. She's joining us from the University
    of Melbourne, in Australia, where she discovered the field of research software
    engineering.
  sec: 68
  time: '1:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: In addition to doing research software engineering and in academia, Johanna
    has contributed to several open source projects and she's an advocate for open
    source and open science. Also, Johanna is a very avid listener of this podcast.
    She once mentioned in a LinkedIn comment that she listened to every single episode
    of this podcast and I thought “I have to invite her.” [Johanna chuckles]
  sec: 68
  time: '1:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Also, you probably heard in a few recent ones that the questions were prepared
    by Johanna Bayer and this is the Johanna. That helps with preparation as well.
    It's a big pleasure to have you here on this podcast. Hi.
  sec: 68
  time: '1:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi. Thanks for having me. I'm really excited to be here.
  sec: 139
  time: '2:19'
  who: Johanna
- header: Johanna’s background
- line: Thanks for being here. Before we go into our main topic of doing software
    engineering in academia, let's start with your background. Can you tell us about
    your career journey so far?
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. As you've already mentioned, my formal background is psychology
    and clinical neuroscience, with more on the clinical side. I started with a Bachelor's
    in psychology. Back then already, my favorite subjects were statistics, the biology
    subject of psychology, and also I had an elective, which was about artificial
    intelligence and the brain. I found it super interesting. Already back then I
    started also sitting in on computer science classes while doing psychology. That
    was in Bamberg, in Germany.
  sec: 154
  time: '2:34'
  who: Johanna
- line: I'm German. Then I got into a kind of very elite Master’s in Munich that taught
    psychology and neuroscience. I continued there in Munich and I also took classes
    there. In the German system, it's quite easy to just do additional stuff compared
    to the Australian system. Maybe that's something you want to talk about later.
  sec: 154
  time: '2:34'
  who: Johanna
- line: When I was in Munich, I applied for Bernstein Center for computational neuroscience,
    they have a program where they give you between your Master’s and your PhD, one
    year of funding to go to any university that you really like and I went to the
    Technical University in Berlin, where I did some modeling for neuroimaging, and
    then to the Translational Neuromodeling Unit in Zurich, where I also did some
    modeling for neuroimaging like auditory stimuli in the brain, basically. While
    I was in Zurich, one of my friends forwarded me a position that was in Australia
    and it sounded really cool.
  sec: 154
  time: '2:34'
  who: Johanna
- line: I applied for this position, which was about creating a normative model of
    the brain and then comparing how people with depression score under this normative
    model. Basically, it's modeling a biomarker for depression in the brain. So I
    applied and I got the position. Basically, I decided within a week that I would
    move to Australia. I was there like half a year later, because of the visa and
    stuff. And I've been here ever since. I’m about to finish my PhD. I’m working
    already as a postdoc in predicting and profiling, depression, anxiety and schizophrenia.
  sec: 154
  time: '2:34'
  who: Johanna
- line: Also, I work with biological features and markers – so brain stuff and also
    behavioral stuff. Apart from that, I do a bit of stuff on the side, like you said,
    open source projects. I've worked for NASA. I've worked for MathWorks, which is,
    let's say, a MATLAB kind of company. I've contributed to open source, been a teaching
    assistant, and I've led hackathons. And I've continued studying computer science,
    but at a German university. That's basically me.
  sec: 154
  time: '2:34'
  who: Johanna
- line: Interesting. As a teaching assistant, which subjects do you teach?
  sec: 327
  time: '5:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's open science. So that's also what I do. I'm really passionate about
    this idea to make science more reproducible, which is a huge issue and also relates
    to our topic, actually, research software engineering. Research software engineering
    can help to make science more reproducible.
  sec: 332
  time: '5:32'
  who: Johanna
- line: As a teaching assistant, you need to help with homework and answer questions
    from students, right?
  sec: 358
  time: '5:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's actually very funny, because I'm a teaching assistant at a university
    in California. So it's remote. We have a Slack community, and they get materials
    from the university. Then I also watch materials on YouTube and I answer questions.
    I taught some subjects, like intro to Git, how to contribute to open source projects,
    and stuff like that, and a bit of machine learning.
  sec: 366
  time: '6:06'
  who: Johanna
- line: Is any of this public?
  sec: 397
  time: '6:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The course that they put out is public, but the teaching stuff is not.
    It’s Zoom face to face. But there is a lot of free stuff that you can get into.
    This course is also free – you can just apply and get into it.
  sec: 400
  time: '6:40'
  who: Johanna
- line: I'm asking because in the courses we have at DataTalks.Club, we usually assume
    some familiarity with Git and things like this, so there are some prerequisites.
    When people without these prerequisites come to learn from our courses, it's a
    bit difficult. The learning curve for them is steeper, some catch up and finish
    the courses, but some do not because they need to pick up extra stuff in addition
    to what we are teaching. Now it's good to know that you teach Git, so we can know
    where to send them.
  sec: 421
  time: '7:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Also, I just recently completed an instructor course for The Carpentries?
    So I don't know whether you've heard about The Carpentries – it's a software company.
    They have scheduled curriculum for very beginner computer science and software
    programming courses. They also have an intro to Git course. It's very structured
    and you can also take these courses online. I'm basically almost a certified instructor
    now. I need to teach my first course. For these courses, people can just go through
    them by themselves – it's open. We can put the link in the show notes. I think
    that's a really nice place for people to begin, because it takes people where
    they are.
  sec: 459
  time: '7:39'
  who: Johanna
- header: Open science course and reproducible papers
- line: I'm really curious to ask you now about this open science course. I know we
    planned to talk about this a bit later, but since we're talking about this now,
    I wanted to ask. In this open science course, what are the things that students
    study? What is the curriculum for this course?
  sec: 510
  time: '8:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first one was Git. The next one kind of fits with the topic of the episode,
    actually. There's this idea about reproducible publication. Basically, the big
    problem that we're facing in academia is a reproducibility crisis. People put
    out papers, but then if other people want to reproduce their findings, it's just
    not possible, especially in my field. Neuroimaging, almost died from this. We're
    still recovering. Basically, there are papers that have titles like, “Why all
    research findings up to now are wrong”. Stuff like that – really, really sad things.
    [nervous chuckle]
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Johanna
- line: There's this idea about reproducible papers, where you have stuff like, for
    example, markdown. You can write your thesis or your paper with your code. You
    basically just send this thing to someone and someone can, from scratch, from
    the data, reproduce the paper that you submitted. So how to do that, for example,
    how to put your code on Git, how to write tests.
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Johanna
- line: It's not very common in academia to write tests to make your code bulletproof.
    Usually students are not so skilled with programming and software engineering
    in general, so their code is less reproducible. So it’s about teaching them sometimes
    very basic skills. But that's the idea. What else did we teach them? Open source
    – how to contribute to open source projects. I think I've said that. Basically,
    that's it.
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Johanna
- line: How do you teach your students to contribute to open source? Do you say, “Okay,
    here's an open source project. Go contribute.” Or is it more guided?
  sec: 642
  time: '10:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's more guided. I started, of course, with kids. But what I like to
    do and what I think really helps is, if you’re in a Zoom session, where you have
    just a very simple repo and you teach people to make pull requests. You accept
    them and they see what happens. Because Git is such an interactive tool, it's
    so hard to learn it by yourself. So that's how I teach them. In my field, we have
    a couple of repositories that are not as big as, for example, NumPy, or SciKit
    Learn – these repositories are massive, and even skilled people get very overwhelmed
    with how to start.
  sec: 652
  time: '10:52'
  who: Johanna
- line: But there are smaller repositories. For example, one of them is the Turing-made
    book. It's a book on reproducible research – a Jupyter book by the Alan Turing
    Institute – and people can just really easily contribute, because it's like a
    book. You can just contribute text or put some citations. This is usually something
    that people from academia are familiar with, like writing a little paragraph and
    putting some citations. That's a very good way for people to start. Usually people
    are way less intimidated if I show them these resources.
  sec: 652
  time: '10:52'
  who: Johanna
- header: Research software engineering
- line: Yeah, pretty interesting. So, since the topic today is doing software engineering
    in academia (I think we more or less started talking about this) I wanted to ask
    you – what is research software engineering? How are research and software engineering
    connected?
  sec: 730
  time: '12:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a very good question. It's actually a very new term. The old
    ways, as I've already indicated, is that people have some data, they make some
    analysis, they write a paper, and then they forget about the data and all the
    analysis. Analysis, in some fields, it's done in SPSS, so it's not at all. I don't
    know whether you know what SPSS is, but it's more like a GUI thing where you do
    statistics.
  sec: 748
  time: '12:28'
  who: Johanna
- line: It’s like Excel, but more powerful, right? [Johanna confirms] It’s a tool
    from IBM. I think I used it in my data mining classes or something like that.
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You click a lot, but it's not bad. The models that are in there are
    really good, but you click a lot. So how would you reproduce that? This is a problem.
    Research software engineering is basically people who take on doing proper analysis
    – they really focus on the methods and on the analysis. That is one part. They
    still focus on publishing papers.
  sec: 785
  time: '13:05'
  who: Johanna
- line: The other part of research software engineering is people who publish software
    as part of their academic output. So they don't publish papers anymore, but they
    put a toolbox on GitHub. I think this can really help because these toolboxes
    and what they produce, it's really tailored to academia. It's done in a very good
    way and these people are really passionate about the software. I’m not saying
    that the other people are not passionate about the analysis, but it is not their
    main focus.
  sec: 785
  time: '13:05'
  who: Johanna
- line: These people who publish software as part of their work in academia, are they
    PhD students or are they hired specifically to just program – to code?
  sec: 850
  time: '14:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, they're usually PhD students. PhD students like me, for example. I didn’t
    publish a toolbox, but rather a method that corrects for side effect differences.
    Basically, when you collect data at different scanning sites, you have differences
    due to the magnetic field strength in the scanner or the vendor of the scanner.
    These differences can screw up your analysis. I published a tool to correct for
    these differences. It has nothing to do with the outcome. For example, differences
    between clinical populations and healthy controls are usually the topic of my
    field. It's really about the method.
  sec: 863
  time: '14:23'
  who: Johanna
- line: Usually it’s people from academia. For me, I always thought that I'm this
    weird person who is really interested in these “middle” things – not really looking
    at the clinical population, not really the topic of my field, but kind of getting
    there. But then I learned that I'm probably a research software engineer. I'm
    just really interested in writing software as my research output. It can also
    be the other side, like you said. I think this comes about more and more often.
  sec: 863
  time: '14:23'
  who: Johanna
- line: People from academia just work in their fields and they are forced to write
    software and sometimes they're not really interested in this aspect. This can
    also happen. And also they’re not really skilled in this aspect. It might actually
    happen that this comes about more and more often that, hopefully, software engineers
    get hired to do these things.
  sec: 863
  time: '14:23'
  who: Johanna
- line: When you got hired for this position, what was the name for this position?
    Was it already called research software engineer? Or was it something else?
  sec: 957
  time: '15:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no. I have three paper applications for my PhD and maybe when we talk
    about it, we talk about the application paper, which is where I do stuff with
    clinical populations and a huge dataset and then there’s something we call the
    methods papers. But really it’s just writing software.
  sec: 969
  time: '16:09'
  who: Johanna
- line: I see. So you still need to publish papers, right?
  sec: 992
  time: '16:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's the other thing. That's what we are hoping will also come about
    – software as research. This output is more and more, hopefully, acknowledged
    as output. For example, you can now get a DOI, a digital identifier for your software
    as well. Most people are happy to publish a manual-like paper or something like
    that. It's just that they don't necessarily want to publish in their field anymore.
  sec: 996
  time: '16:36'
  who: Johanna
- header: Convincing a professor to work on software instead of papers
- line: I'm curious, how do you convince your professor to let you work on software
    instead of publishing papers? I guess many professors are used to only one KPI,
    which is the number of papers published by their department. Probably it should
    be like IA Star conferences or whatever – high impact publications. So how do
    you go and convince them that, “Hey, doing papers is good, but we also need to
    publish some software.”
  sec: 1030
  time: '17:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it is very hard. There are definitely people (PI's) that are more willing
    to do this, and some are less willing to do it. I was relatively lucky with my
    supervisor. We ran into this problem and I made it one of my topics and I'm very
    happy that she let me do this. But I have a really good supervisor – she's very
    flexible. But yeah, that's an issue. Often people do it in their free time because
    they're really interested in it, which shouldn't be the case. In academia, it's
    also – I don't know whether you know that, but academia has lots of fluctuations.
    The contracts are very short. So if you don't like where you are, you just move.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 1069
  time: '17:49'
  who: Johanna
- line: If you just move, then you have to start your PhD research from scratch?
  sec: 1122
  time: '18:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's true. I mean after that.
  sec: 1128
  time: '18:48'
  who: Johanna
- line: I see. [chuckles] So it's more of a bottom-up approach – when PhD students
    approach their supervisors and say, “Look, there’s this problem in our field.
    We need to make our research reproducible.” Does it also happen in a top-down
    manner, for example, when the professor says, “Okay. Listen, everyone. Now in
    our department, we all care about reproducibility.”?
  sec: 1135
  time: '18:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I know some professors, like one Stanford who kind of started this whole idea.
    He definitely does that. But it's less common. One reason for that is that many
    people who are in PI positions just didn't grow up with software or analysis like
    we do now, in general. They're a bit more scared of it. Also, they have less time.
    They're not doing the analysis anymore. Yeah, it's definitely a problem. On the
    other hand, like you said, it's a grassroots approach. There’s also these hackathons
    that we organize – they try to teach people and pull people in from the bottom
    to apply these principles.
  sec: 1158
  time: '19:18'
  who: Johanna
- header: The importance of reproducible analysis
- line: What you are talking about reminds me of the state of data science like 10-20
    years ago, when it just started. Industry companies would hire data scientists
    who are just fresh from academia – very smart people with PhDs in physics, mathematics,
    and so on – and they would tell them, “Okay, there’s this dataset that we have,
    now go figure out how to make it valuable.” And then it didn't work out.
  sec: 1205
  time: '20:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Companies realized that just hiring academics is not enough and that they
    actually need software engineers. Now it's usually expected that data scientists
    know how to program, that they know Git, that they know all these reproducibility
    things. On top of that, we also have these machine learning engineers, data engineers
    – all these engineers that help data scientists. Do you think I got it right that
    it's similar in a way?
  sec: 1205
  time: '20:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Like you said, it's a bit like 10 years ago. I think that we are at
    the verge and it's inevitable because digitalization is just everywhere. Regardless
    of which field you're in – even like in humanities or social sciences – at some
    point, you will have to do analysis and at some point, someone will ask you to
    be able to reproduce it. I think it's coming. Also it's very interesting, because
    I also think industry and also other fields have already solved a lot of the problems
    that we're still facing. For example, I attended the Machine Learning Zoomcamp
    and MLflow – it's great. [laughs] I'd never heard about this before. If you don't
    look out, if you don't search yourself as a scientist, academia doesn't teach
    you these things. The scientists themselves have to take the initiative at the
    moment. It's not good. It should be more top-down, but it's not.
  sec: 1263
  time: '21:03'
  who: Johanna
- line: Do you now use MLflow in your experiments?
  sec: 1329
  time: '22:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I really like it. [chuckles] It’s very useful.
  sec: 1332
  time: '22:12'
  who: Johanna
- header: Why academia is behind on software engineering
- line: Why do you think academia is behind? Why is nobody teaching these things?
  sec: 1336
  time: '22:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think there are many reasons. Like I said, I think many PI's really didn't
    grow up in their academic career with this and they're coming from an era where
    it was really okay if you just published a paper and burned your analysis. Nobody
    would ever ask you about this. But the other thing is that we have this problem
    that the digitalization of any academic field is there, but the people that work
    there are actually more interested in their topic. Someone who does social sciences
    or some humanities field – they don't want to do analysis, they want to work on
    whatever.
  sec: 1341
  time: '22:21'
  who: Johanna
- line: Take a social worker, for example, they don't want to deal with t-tests and
    statistics and modeling – they want to care about people. But they are now forced
    to do this and I think that's the problem. People are sometimes a bit reluctant.
    They're also a bit scared, they work in a different field, and now they're kind
    of forced to do this. It can also be scary. You put out work and then you basically
    give people everything, and they can find errors. They can say “Your analysis
    is wrong.” And then you have to reject a paper that you've been working on for
    a year or something. This can be scary. But in the end, I think it would help
    academia to have to kind of enforce reproducibility throughout.
  sec: 1341
  time: '22:21'
  who: Johanna
- header: The problems with open science publishing in academia
- line: What do you think is still missing? What kind of tools, like MLflow, do you
    want to adopt in academia, or you think should be adopted in academia, to solve
    these problems? Or at least start solving them?
  sec: 1434
  time: '23:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Tests. [chuckles] I've never seen anyone writing tests. It's just not
    common at all. And then, the idea of the reproducible paper – I think that would
    be really good. But the problem that I have is that I'm desperately trying to
    find a space to host it, because if you put it on Amazon (AWS) or whatever, you
    have to pay for it. For example, I make a figure and I want people to be able
    to interact with this figure – this is easily possible. In Python, you can do
    that locally on your computer – you can turn it around and hover over it and look
    at data points.
  sec: 1449
  time: '24:09'
  who: Johanna
- line: But if I wanted to make this available to other people, I would have to put
    it somewhere and then I would probably have to pay for it. This concerns not only
    short-term, but long-term because this paper will be out for a couple of years
    and people will still want to look at this figure. And I think there's no solution
    for this. I think the universities should provide some space for the researchers,
    basically.
  sec: 1449
  time: '24:09'
  who: Johanna
- line: Maybe Google Colab could be an alternative?
  sec: 1514
  time: '25:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, definitely. But then… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1517
  time: '25:17'
  who: Johanna
- line: Then you have to scroll down all the way to find this figure and to interact
    with it. So it’s not a paper, right?
  sec: 1521
  time: '25:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's not a paper. The idea of this reproducible paper would be that
    you provide the data as well. You provide the data, you provide all the scripts,
    and people just click, and from the raw data, it runs through the analysis, and
    it gives you all the figures. Being able to put that somewhere will be great,
    so I could just say, “Take this and just click a button.” Then people wouldn't
    have to run a Docker or whatever – just click a button and it will all come down.
    That would be great. [chuckles]
  sec: 1528
  time: '25:28'
  who: Johanna
- line: Do you use Python or R? [Johanna confirms both] I remember there was a time
    when I also used R – it was long ago – but remember that in R Studio, there was
    a way to publish. You write in the R Markdown and then you publish it to something
    called RPubs (or something like that). [Johanna confirms] But it’s still not interactive,
    right?
  sec: 1561
  time: '26:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is. I have done that. I did it with one figure. It basically gets pushed
    to an instance or something but then you can only run this instance for 25 hours
    per month for free and then you have to pay. It would be perfect. Another problem
    is, of course, the data that I'm using is imaging data – it's pretty big. [chuckles]
    I pushed it to this R instance and it was just this one little brain figure that
    you could rotate. It's a big figure and I was like, “Okay, this is one out of
    15 that I have in my paper. [laughs] Okay. Maybe not.”

  time: '27:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I guess the teaching of standard coding practices to all academic fields.
    There should be one introduction to programming or statistics class for everyone.
    Stuff like the proper modularization of code, for example, how to write a package,
    how to set up an environment – these types of things – how to write a requirements
    text file. Very basic things. I think that will be good.

  sec: 1692
  time: '28:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Like I said, I was already interested in computer science very early. But
    I think what really brought me to this open science/open source field was Brainhack.
    It was actually during the pandemic. I don't know whether you know, but in Australia,
    we had a massive lockdown. For eight months you were not allowed to go more than
    five kilometers from your house, and like two hours outside per day. So it was
    very isolated. I don't have family here. My field hosts this hackathon, it's actually
    an organization called Brainhack. It's about hackathons for neuroscience, basically.
    This is a complete grassroots organization and the way it works is like a typical
    hackathon. You join and either you pitch a project or you can join a project.
  sec: 1698
  time: '28:18'
  who: Johanna
- line: I joined a project – I don't even remember what it was about – like implementing
    a canonical correlation in Python or something like that. [chuckles] I really
    liked the vibe there and I really liked the people. The next one was right around
    the corner, so I decided to help organize it. That really got me into open science
    and open source because I got tasked with things like how to create the website
    for the new event. You go to GitHub and you tweak the current website – you make
    a copy of the current website and tweak it for the next website – so you learn
    a bit about web development. Then you see what else is on GitHub and you talk
    to people who have all these skills and they teach you.
  sec: 1698
  time: '28:18'
  who: Johanna
- line: Then I also applied as a secretary of a global open science group, which was
    a role I had for a year. Basically, they were looking for people to join them
    at the Brainhack. So all this basically started like that. Then I just never stopped.
    [chuckles] I just joined community after community. And I like it a lot.
  sec: 1698
  time: '28:18'
  who: Johanna
- line: So for you it was more learning by doing rather than just attending a course
    that teaches you everything that you need to know. Right?
  sec: 1834
  time: '30:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, also the other thing is – I think I've mentioned already – it was a
    bit out of necessity. I'm still doing my computer science degree at the University
    Hagen Like – that's the one that sends you stuff. Here in Australia, you basically
    pay for every course. I got a scholarship for my PhD and also a living allowance,
    but if you want to sit another course, you pay for it.
  sec: 1844
  time: '30:44'
  who: Johanna
- line: Usually it’s quite a sum, similar to American tuition fees. So it's impossible
    to just sit another course here. I would have done it, of course. So you just
    have to get by with what you find on the internet, which is actually a lot. You
    can totally have a full computer science degree (or an equivalent [chuckles])
    just doing stuff on the internet.
  sec: 1844
  time: '30:44'
  who: Johanna
- line: You need to have the discipline. In university, if you don't do the courses,
    you don't get credits and if you don't get credits, you don't graduate. [Johanna
    agrees] But if you're just studying by yourself, then you have to have the discipline
    and you don't get the credits. That's a different kind of motivation, I guess.
  sec: 1896
  time: '31:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is, yeah. The other thing that I also started is freelancing. That also
    puts a bit of pressure. [laughs] If you get paid for doing stuff, you basically
    better deliver at some point. [laughs]
  sec: 1917
  time: '31:57'
  who: Johanna
- header: Effective ways of learning software engineering skills
- line: Do you think what you did is the most effective way of picking up these skills?
    Just starting freelancing and taking part in hackathons and learning by doing?
    Or are there maybe better ways researchers can learn these things?
  sec: 1935
  time: '32:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, good question. I guess there are better ways. If you want to learn something
    and if you are in a country where it's easy just to sit another course, I would
    totally do that. As you said, it's way more structured, you have peers that do
    the same. I would totally do that. Apart from that, I don't think that it's the
    worst way. It’s definitely a lot of fun doing it this way, I would say.
  sec: 1953
  time: '32:33'
  who: Johanna
- line: I noticed that we have a question. The question is, “Does anyone revise your
    code? Do you work alone or is there somebody in your team with whom you can discuss
    different things?”
  sec: 1984
  time: '33:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a very good question. In academia, sadly, when you're not in a computer
    science or a technical field lab, usually, you work alone. I have a supervisor
    (not the one that I have here but another one) who is really technically skilled.
    He has developed this idea about the type of model that I use on the brain, so
    he could help me. But he's in the Netherlands. Usually, you work alone, which
    makes it even more necessary that you put your code on GitHub [chuckles] so that
    someone can actually have a look at it.
  sec: 2000
  time: '33:20'
  who: Johanna
- line: You said that you're a part of many communities. I imagine that there are
    communities where people also care about this topic. If you work alone, then you
    can put some code to GitHub, and then perhaps ask other researchers from these
    communities to take a look. Does this happen?
  sec: 2045
  time: '34:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it does happen. It happens especially when you publish your code with
    your paper. I get requests from people that read my paper and they say, “Look.
    Your code – I don't understand this part. Can you explain?” And then you say “Oh,
    yeah. I can see why you don't understand. Maybe it wasn't explained that well
    in my report.”
  sec: 2064
  time: '34:24'
  who: Johanna
- line: But this adds a lot of work on top of what you do. In a typical scenario,
    you publish a paper, you go to a conference, you talk about this paper, or maybe
    you have a poster session. This is two days. Then maybe you get a few emails,
    you answer these emails and then you focus on the next paper. But here, you get
    comments, “Okay, I don't understand your code.” It just adds a lot more stuff
    to your plate, right?
  sec: 2089
  time: '34:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it does. It's definitely often driven by a lot of idealism, trying to
    like science better, I would say. The entire field of academia is probably populated
    by people who don't do things just for the money and effectiveness, because then
    they would move to industry where they would get paid way more for what they're
    doing. I think that's just the case.
  sec: 2123
  time: '35:23'
  who: Johanna
- line: Okay. So you just know that it will take more effort and you know that this
    is for the greater good, so you're willing to put more time into this.
  sec: 2155
  time: '35:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. And I do enjoy it. I like it. I like working on these things. I like
    collaborating with people. Often, it's also quite good. They give you new ideas
    or new insights, or they think like, “Oh, I saw this in your code and I thought
    it would be nice to extend it by this. What do you think about this? Can we collaborate?”
    It can also help you in many ways. There's definitely studies that show that if
    you publish your code – there's this really cool paid webpage called Papers With
    Code, which is a collection of papers where the code is shared – it shows that
    these kinds of papers get more citations, they get more recognition. So it definitely
    helps you. Also, of course, it helps you if you want to go into a more software
    engineering direction. Further on it, of course, also helps you if you have repositories
    that you can share and showcase.
  sec: 2165
  time: '36:05'
  who: Johanna
- header: Providing data and analysis for your project
- line: Yeah, I see that there is a comment that says “I asked a researcher about
    his code and he never replied. The code was buggy.” Do you think that this kind
    of situation happens often? [Johanna confirms] Well, at least there's code, which
    is already a good thing.
  sec: 2221
  time: '37:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it gets even funnier. There was this thread on GitHub where, just for
    experimental purposes, this one researcher… Usually people add to the manuscripts,
    “Data can be obtained upon request.” They asked 250 researchers who had put this
    statement under their paper for the data and basically showcased the replies to
    this kind of request. A couple of them provided the data and for others, it was
    like, “Yeah, the data left our lab with the last PhD student,” or like, “We couldn't
    find the data anymore, so I just didn’t reply.” [chuckles] Really, it's a bit
    ridiculous. [laughs] But that's the current state.
  sec: 2239
  time: '37:19'
  who: Johanna
- line: I guess there are conferences where you have to provide code and data in order
    to publish there. [Johanna confirms] Conferences and journals, right?
  sec: 2287
  time: '38:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, if you want to apply for grants, that's usually a requirement that you
    adhere to open science principles. Also, many, many journals actually ask for
    both the code and the data. Like I said, it's coming because people are recognizing
    the issues in the field. It's not a good state. It's what contributed to this
    open science and reproducibility crisis.
  sec: 2297

  who: Johanna
- header: Johanna’s initial experience with software engineering in a project
- line: Maybe you can tell us a few examples of projects that you worked on and how
    adding these engineering practices helped? Because from what I understood, you
    didn't start as a research software engineer, you started as a normal PhD student,
    but you had this interest in open science/open source computer science.
  sec: 2330
  time: '38:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe you can tell us about one of the projects that you did and then how
    you realize that you need to start adding these things and how it looked like.
    What did you add first, what did you add second, and so on? And how did it help
    you in the end?
  sec: 2330
  time: '38:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think a good example is my current and my oldest PhD project, which
    is about the normative model of the brain, basically. I'm working on a very big
    depression dataset. It's massive, at least for clinical standards. I went in and
    my first issue was, “How should I organize the folder structure?” I found Cookie
    Cutter, which is a repository that has examples for the structures – for different
    fields. You can go there and it creates one. So that was very helpful. You do
    that and create an environment for your code. That helps. Then, of course, Git.
    If you push stuff on Git, there's also a principle that I learned. You have at
    least two branches – one is a main branch and the other one is a dev branch –
    and you never push new stuff to the main branch, but you push it to the dev branch.
    It's just very simple things.
  sec: 2367
  time: '39:27'
  who: Johanna
- line: What else did I do? Then code formatting standards. Of course, there are tools
    that do that. In R, you can just click “format my code,” but there's Flake, Flake8,
    and I think Black is the one in Python that you can use. What else? Version control,
    for example, for your models MLflow. And then of course, just reading a lot of
    good code can also have an effect. What else did I do? I also have to say, at
    the beginning. I probably deleted all my experiments and redid them from scratch
    like three times. [chuckles] Because it was just so messy. But that's just how
    it is. Now I'm kind of at a stage where I start a project and I know what to do.
    I know how to set it up. I know how to keep things clean.
  sec: 2367
  time: '39:27'
  who: Johanna
- line: So you didn't do this project knowing that you needed to add all these best
    practices, right? For you, you realized it while working on the project – I guess
    when you deleted your experiments for the first time, you thought “Okay, how do
    I make sure that this doesn't happen?”
  sec: 2512
  time: '41:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It was definitely a learning process. But like I said, it's kind of
    just academia – where you figure things out. [laughs]
  sec: 2531
  time: '42:11'
  who: Johanna
- header: Working with sensitive data and the nuances of publishing it
- line: I remember for my Master’s thesis – I don't know how representative this is
    – but usually, the way to organize exploratory data analysis for many ad hoc tasks
    is quite messy. I have a ton of notebooks there, they have very cryptic names.
    Then I know that I need to push them to Git but… sometimes there are tokens, some
    sensitive information that I don't want to push – I need to clean them. They stay
    without being pushed to Git and then something happens, like the file gets corrupted
    for whatever reasons, and then the notebook is lost. Yeah. Terrible. [chuckles]
    So I guess you have to solve this and this is how you discovered all these best
    practices.
  sec: 2542
  time: '42:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Also, often in academia, at least in my field, you have data that is
    sensitive, so you just can't put any data to any repository. But you can put metadata
    or parameters from your models that you fitted – they are quite nonspecific, like
    a mean or whatever.
  sec: 2591
  time: '43:11'
  who: Johanna
- line: Well, for your project, you mentioned that the data is about depression, which
    can be quite sensitive, right? Can you publish this data? Or you cannot?
  sec: 2621
  time: '43:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. The data is from a consortium that you can get access to if you write
    a proposal. But no, I wouldn't be able to publish the data.
  sec: 2630
  time: '43:50'
  who: Johanna
- line: And if you need to submit a paper based on this data somewhere – to an open
    science conference – how do you do this?
  sec: 2644
  time: '44:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You can present figures. Like I said, you can present the mean of whatever.
    My research is about the thickness of the cortex, so that's what I focus on, whether
    the thicker thickness of the cortex is smaller in people with depression or not.
    So you can provide a mean. You can also provide de-identified data like it's just
    some depressed brain. [chuckles]
  sec: 2652
  time: '44:12'
  who: Johanna
- line: Of course, there’s no personal data, but even I don't have that data. I don't
    have this information. But still, you wouldn't publish the whole… I mean, there
    are some datasets that are definitely about this. But for my data, it's part of
    this consortium, and you need to write a proposal. So not everybody can have this
    data.
  sec: 2652

  sec: 2724
  time: '45:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: At the moment less often than I would like to. I already work full-time as
    a research fellow. I'm trying to finish my PhD in the hours before and after that
    [chuckles] during the day. I just recently contributed to a code sprint of this
    Turing repository. There's a very nice community. And that's the good thing about
    living in Australia – all the stuff that happens during the day in Europe happens
    during the evening here, so you can do stuff after work. I think at least once
    or twice per month, usually. There are just a lot of things that I contribute
    to. I'm almost daily on Git just looking for new stuff. I'm in a lot of communities
    where they also always bring up new stuff or things that you can contribute to.
    They look for people to give a talk or things like that.

    teaching program. Then the research software engineering community – we have an
    Australian chapter, but there's also a global chapter and there's also a German
    chapter and a UK chapter. My open science community. DataTalks.club, of course.
    [chuckles] Then there's another podcast that I think is called MLOps Podcast.
    I'm not very active in that one. Kaggle – that's also one. They also have, I think,
    a very unofficial Slack channel.

    I work on physiological noise collection for fMRI. We have a Slack channel all

    also a really good one.

    across a Git repo that is interesting for you and you want to contribute. What
    happens next?
  sec: 2986
  time: '49:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Usually I look at the readme first of all, then the contributing. Then it
    depends on how big the repo is. It can be a repo that’s structured in releases,
    then it's usually quite well organized, but also quite big. For smaller repos,
    I always look at the dev branch, because that's usually where the more interesting
    stuff happens. Then I would probably look at the documentation and they have.
    One of the repos that I'm preparing to contribute to at the moment is SciKit Learn
    and they have a really nice intro for new developers.
  sec: 3000
  time: '50:00'
  who: Johanna
- line: Basically, they guide you. They also show you what coding principles you have
    to adhere to, how to format your code, what tests to run, and stuff like that.
    So I would look at that. Then of course, you look at the issues, and you look
    at stuff that needs to be done. Then download the repo and look whether you can
    give this a fix. It's also always good to actually talk to people. If you see
    someone that has opened an issue, you can just talk to them saying like, “So what
    did you think about this? How should we approach this? I would be really interested.
    Are you already working on this?” Git is a very collaborative tool. It's made
    to get in touch with people.
  sec: 3000

    not just for contributing to SciKit Learn. Right?
  sec: 3095

  who: Alexey
- header: Publishing in the open in academia vs industry
- line: Exactly. [chuckles] Yeah. Apart from that, like I said, at the moment a lot
    of my time is actually spent on my work. That's the good thing about academia
    is that you work on stuff that is very easily converted into an open science project.
    It's meant to be this way. It's a good thing if you do this – if you add open
    science on top of it. If you do an analysis for a paper and if you then go to
    your professor or whatever, and say, “I would really like to put this code on
    GitHub. We would make sure that all sensitive information is removed. Would you
    mind that?” They probably wouldn't say no.
  sec: 3142
  time: '52:22'
  who: Johanna
- line: If you just say, “I’ll take care of this.” They wouldn't say no. I think it's
    quite easy. I think academia is also really nice because it provides you with
    a very structured approach to projects. I’ve heard that for many people in industry,
    it's quite hard to have a portfolio of projects that you can showcase. Academia
    works this way. You start with some data, you do something about it, and you publish
    it.
  sec: 3142
  time: '52:22'
  who: Johanna
- line: I guess in academia, the reason people are in academia is to do research and
    then share it with the world. There is no reason a professor would say, “No, you
    shouldn't publish the code.” Because that's the reason you are in academia – to
    share what you do with the rest of the world. While in industry, there could be
    things like, “Okay, it's actually giving us a competitive edge. We don't want
    to share it because our competitors will take our code and use it and get more
    money than us.” In academia, this doesn't exist. Does it?
  sec: 3213
  time: '53:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah – I just wanted to say… There are definitely arguments when people say,
    “If I put this on GitHub, I get scooped.” I haven't experienced that from people
    in academia. What I have experienced is, when I worked at a startup, indeed, I
    was asked whether I could just use some code from my one of my supervisors and
    I said no. [chuckles] I mean, it's a no-brainer because this code is A) not mine
    and B) under license that wouldn't allow this. It's an absolute no-brainer, but
    then this person just said, “Yeah, this happens all the time. We just rewrite
    it in a different language.” And I said no. Yeah, it shouldn’t happen, but it's
    a danger. But I think it's not the rule. Usually people would rather approach
    you to collaborate, I think.

- header: Johanna’s book and resource recommendations
- line: I see. It seems like it's a new topic, but there are already courses for open
    science and research software engineering. Are there already books about this
    topic that you can recommend?
  sec: 3312
  time: '55:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Books? Not yet. I'm actually thinking about writing one. [chuckles] Definitely,
    the Alan Turing book is about open science. And what else? Yeah, definitely a
    couple of papers about it. I think that's mostly it.
  sec: 3330
  time: '55:30'
  who: Johanna
- line: Is there something you would recommend anyways? Maybe not related to this
    particular topic, but in general? Maybe you have some good book recommendations
    or other resource recommendations?
  sec: 3358
  time: '55:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's very funny because, of course, I knew this question would come
    as I was the one who suggested this question. [laughs] What I also do is… Oh!
    I forgot to mention one social media – Discord. I made a Discord channel from
    Pact (the publisher) and they sometimes give books that are about to be published
    for people to read. I'm part of this channel.
  sec: 3370

  who: Johanna
- line: One of them is the Machine Learning Solutions Architect Handbook. I was one
    of the people who read this book. It's really good. It's pretty comprehensive
    – I think like 800 pages. But it also has hands-on exercises, which I really like,
    after each chapter. I would recommend that, I think. I really like that book.
  sec: 3370
  time: '56:10'
  who: Johanna
- line: 800 pages! That’s like this. [gestures with hands]
  sec: 3423
  time: '57:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's fairly comprehensive. It's pretty big. I got the ebook, of course.
  sec: 3428
  time: '57:08'
  who: Johanna
- line: So what does the table of contents look like there? What are the topics they
    cover?
  sec: 3435
  time: '57:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Everything about machine learning, but then also how to set it up on AWS.
    Yeah, it's a pretty good book. I had one month – I actually didn't read all of
    it. I still need to go through the rest because it was just so much. [chuckles]
  sec: 3441
  time: '57:21'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah. 800 pages.
  sec: 3456
  time: '57:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I recommended it for publication.
  sec: 3459
  time: '57:39'
  who: Johanna
- line: Business use cases for machine learning, science, tools and infrastructure,
    platform for ML, ML algorithms, data management, open source machine learning
    libraries, Kubernetes. Yeah.. and I just started the list. There's so much stuff.
  sec: 3462
  time: '57:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's really big.
  sec: 3480

- line: Okay. Did I forget to ask you anything that you wanted to talk about?
  sec: 3483
  time: '58:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I don't think so.
  sec: 3490

  sec: 3492
  time: '58:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: We covered everything, yeah. It was really, really cool. The time flew by,
    really.
  sec: 3494

  who: Johanna
- line: It did, yes. I hope your cat enjoyed this.
  sec: 3500
  time: '58:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think she went… she always lives in my cupboard. I think she went
    there to sleep.
  sec: 3504

  who: Johanna
- line: Johanna, thanks for joining us today. That was fun talking to you. It seems
    like you enjoyed it. That's good. [chuckles]
  sec: 3516
  time: '58:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It was really interesting, yeah.
  sec: 3524
  time: '58:44'
  who: Johanna

  sec: 3526
  time: '58:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] We’ll see.'
  sec: 3531
  time: '58:51'
  who: Johanna
- line: There will be a transcript that you can just read. [chuckles]
  sec: 3534
  time: '58:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I can just read and then like, “Oh, did I really say this?” [laughs]
  sec: 3536
  time: '58:56'
  who: Johanna
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah. Thanks for joining us today. Thanks, everyone, also for
    joining us today, for asking… We got one question in the comments, so thanks for
    being active. I know it''s a pretty early time.  Have a great weekend, everyone.'
