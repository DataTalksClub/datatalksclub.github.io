description: 'Learn ML Product Manager tactics: MLOps platform strategy, observability KPIs & adoption playbooks to own roadmaps, governance, and stakeholder ROI.'
intro: How do you become an ML product manager and build MLOps platforms that teams actually use? In this episode, Geo Jolly, a Technical PM at Glovo with a background from web/dev to data science and product management, walks through the practical skills and decisions that define the role. <br><br> We cover MLOps platform strategy and vendor evaluation, treating internal platform users as customers, and the real productivity costs of poor tooling UX. Geo outlines product manager responsibilities—roadmaps, specs, backlog prioritization—and explains outcome-driven problem definition, avoiding solution bias, and running workshops and interviews to break down complex problems. You’ll hear about ML observability and KPIs to measure platform impact, release governance and rollout timing, adoption strategy for internal stakeholders, and engineering roles needed for platform delivery (CI/CD, K8s, syseng). Practical topics also include model validation and ML quality assurance, embedded data scientists as power users, Agile approaches for data science, and concrete transition paths from data scientist or Scrum Master into technical ML product roles. <br><br> Listen to gain actionable guidance on MLOps platforms, observability, adoption strategy, and the technical literacy required to succeed as an ML product manager

- header: 'Guest Overview: Geo and episode focus on AI Product Manager role'
- line: This week, we'll talk about the AI Product Manager role. We have a special
    guest today, Geo. Both Geo and I studied on the same program, which was information
    technologies for business intelligence. I did this a few years earlier. After
    graduating, Geo worked as a data scientist, like me. This is also what I did after
    graduating. But after working for a couple of years as a data scientist, Geo switched
    his focus to product management and this is what we will talk about today. Welcome
    Geo.
  sec: 73
  time: '1:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks a lot, Alexey. Appreciate it.
  sec: 102
  time: '1:42'
  who: Geo
- line: Yeah, thanks for coming. Before we go into our main topic of the AI/ML product
    manager role, let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career
    journey so far?
  sec: 104
  time: '1:44'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Journey: From web/dev to data science to product management'
- line: Yeah, definitely. I think that will help the audience as well. My background
    is mostly computer science engineering, which is what I studied for my Bachelor's.
    I think most of my initial interactions were more Lean, like pure software development
    and web. Even during my studies, I was doing a lot of websites, blogging – I was
    into these kinds of things. At that time, content writing wasn’t like blogs, since
    blogs didn't exist. It was mostly typing content. I was into that, so I did WordPress,
    PHP, baseline optimization, and social media marketing. I did that quite a lot,
    I would say. But it was good. When I think about it now, it has actually helped
    me to understand a lot of key concepts and basics. It was also time for me to
    practice what I was learning as well.
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Geo
- line: After my graduation, I worked as a developer as well – Java development backend.
    I did that and then while I was working, this opportunity for BI came along. Then
    I moved to Europe from India and I did a Master's. After finalizing my Master's,
    I worked as a data science engineer. During my Master's, I worked with ING Bank
    for a while, but it was more like a small internship. But I think that would be
    my first formal experience as a product manager. I was working very closely with
    the product management team. After my studies, I went back to data science. So
    I was like, “I think this is what I want to do.” That was my impression. But then
    I slowly realized, “Maybe product management is something that I would be more
    interested in doing.”
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Geo
- line: I always like to see the bigger picture of things and adding more value to
    the business. I know that data science also does it, but sometimes it's just not
    visible. I liked all this stuff that product managers were doing, so I slowly
    switched into that direction. Then I moved to the UK and was working as a product
    manager for Revolute for two years. Now I’m at Glovo as a technical product manager.
    That's my career – nothing very surprising. Normal track of software engineer
    to data science and some of it was continuous data science, but I decided to go
    into product management.
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Geo
- line: Yeah. That's interesting. You said that you had a bit of product management
    experience as an intern. But then you thought “Okay, since I'm doing this Master's,
    I want to do data science.” So you tried a bit of that for a couple of years and
    then you realized that product management was for you, right?
  sec: 284
  time: '4:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but I wasn't sure. I knew that I liked product management, but it's
    not an easy job to get into. Product management is not something that is taught
    in any university or anything like that. It's something that you need to learn
    by doing. So it wasn't easy to get into a product management job. I was just waiting
    for the right time and right moment to come along. It was there in my mind, “Okay,
    I want to do this.” But I was just not 100% sure.
  sec: 305
  time: '5:05'
  who: Geo
- line: Okay. So the main driver for you was, as you said, that you wanted to see
    the bigger picture, and not just contribute to a specific piece of the system.
    You wanted to have an impact on the overall product. Is that right?
  sec: 339
  time: '5:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I also enjoyed going in and seeing the bigger architectures and how
    these multiple systems interact with each other. As a PM, you can also set the
    direction of where the project is going, which I found quite interesting. I know
    some people like that, while others don't – they want to focus on a smaller scope
    and keep improving it. That's fair. We need people like that as well. I just didn't
    see myself doing that.
  sec: 354
  time: '5:54'
  who: Geo
- header: 'Glovo Role: Leading ML platform strategy and team responsibilities'
- line: Can you tell us more about what Glovo does and what you do there as a technical
    PM?
  sec: 388
  time: '6:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. Glovo is originally from Barcelona and was founded in 2015. Right now
    I'm based in Barcelona as well. It's a super app, but its main focus is on food
    delivery. The mission is very simple – to give access to anything in the city.
    So it really doesn't matter if it's food, groceries, pharmaceuticals, supermarkets
    – Glovo is set to deliver everything. The model is the traditional flywheel marketplace
    model. You have different sellers trying to sell their stuff, like restaurants,
    pharmacies – that's the model. I think almost 100 million orders are done every
    year, on average. The app is currently operating in almost 20 plus countries globally.
  sec: 396
  time: '6:36'
  who: Geo
- line: My job in Glovo is to lead the team that’s managing the machine learning platform.
    Essentially, I'm a technical product manager there and I define the vision and
    direction that this platform should be going. That involves helping data scientists
    deploy different machine learning models. In Glovo, we have 50+ data scientists
    and a lot of data analysts. All of them are using machine learning to add value
    to the business. What my platform is doing is essentially helping them by providing
    the infrastructure to productionize their models faster and providing different
    tools for managing the quality of models, etc. Basically the job involves identifying
    what to do with the platform. “How can we improve the platform?” And “What's next?
    “How can we improve it and align it to make it better?”
  sec: 396
  time: '6:36'
  who: Geo
- line: You said, “Lead a team that manages the ML platform.” Does this mean that
    you're building your own platform, or you have some other platform that you manage?
  sec: 510
  time: '8:30'
  who: Alexey
- header: In-house MLOps Platform Strategy & Vendor Evaluation
- line: We are building our own. It's an in-house solution. Essentially, we have a
    legacy platform right now. Maybe legacy is maybe a bit of a harsh term to use
    since it’s just three years old. But the thing is – industry is going so fast
    and the requirements are super high now. For example, the platform we have right
    now has a training orchestration that was done in Jenkins. But we are now slowly
    moving into Argo and Airflow, so the orchestration is more scalable. So these
    are the kind of things that we do. Slowly, we are improving. In the end, it's
    an in-house platform, though we do integrate third-party tools based on the requirements.
    It's not like we build everything. It depends on VSS. If you feel like, “Hey,
    this capability may not be feasible for us to build in-house.” What we do is we
    assess the vendors and say, “Okay, maybe let's use that solution and integrate
    with the platform.”
  sec: 521
  time: '8:41'
  who: Geo
- line: Is this something that you do as a technical product manager?
  sec: 584
  time: '9:44'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Product Manager Responsibilities: Roadmap, specs, and stakeholder balance'
- line: Yeah. Essentially, my role would be to take ongoing feedback from data scientists.
    I discuss it with them – I may not speak to every data scientist, but I usually
    speak with data science leads or managers of data scientists – I take their feedback
    and see what the problems and challenges are in using the platform. That's one
    way I approach it. The second one is reviewing the existing product and seeing
    what's out there on the market and where the product stands. Here, I try to understand,
    “Hey, my platform has these gaps. How can we fill them?” This means the product
    needs more capabilities in the platform.
  sec: 590
  time: '9:50'
  who: Geo
- line: So you come in and write the specifications and roadmap and ensure that the
    deliveries come from this. That's another direction. Finally, as always, you have
    the technical depth which may slow things down, but it can also be an accelerator.
    So how does one manage this efficiently and prioritize it? You need to find the
    right balance so that the business is not slowing down. You give the data scientists
    what they want. Some models may need custom tools, so you give them that and prioritize
    what they want. Meanwhile, you also continue improving the platform.
  sec: 590
  time: '9:50'
  who: Geo
- line: Interesting. So this is an internal product, meaning that you are not a customer-facing
    team, right? So what is the main idea behind your role? Why does the company have
    a product manager for an internal team?
  sec: 669
  time: '11:09'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Internal Platform Users as Customers: ROI and adoption considerations'
- line: Yeah, that's a very good point. Even though it's internal, in the end, there
    are 100+ people using this platform. They are the customers for this platform.
    We need to accelerate the quality of the models – we need faster time to deployment.
    Therefore, we are actually enabling users of the platform to add more value to
    customers. It's not a direct correlation, but rather an indirect one. You are
    actually enabling everyone in the company to deliver more and more value to the
    customer. That's one way of looking at it.
  sec: 684
  time: '11:24'
  who: Geo
- line: Secondly, even though it's an internal platform, you still need to understand
    what your customers need as the platform grows. You also need to look into the
    industry and say, “Hey, this is what we need to do right now. We need someone
    who can actually prioritize what needs to be done and what capabilities need to
    be in the platform.” So that's how a product manager adds more value there. Then,
    since it's a big platform, you have different requirements coming from different
    stakeholders – data scientists have different needs, then business data engineers
    may have different needs, apart from that, you also have internal requests, “I
    need these bugs to be fixed.” This requires prioritization and understanding.
  sec: 684
  time: '11:24'
  who: Geo
- line: Based on all the things that need to be done, a product manager assesses what
    can be done and what the best way to do it is. I definitely believe that even
    though it's an internal platform, at some point you need product managers to make
    it efficient and operate it in the right direction. Otherwise, I have seen platforms
    that reach very, very messy states – they have a lot of tools, a lot of capabilities,
    and no one knows how to use them and there is no direction to it all.
  sec: 684
  time: '11:24'
  who: Geo
- line: So that's what happens when an internal team – a tooling team or a platform
    team – doesn't have a product manager, right?
  sec: 817
  time: '13:37'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Platform Usability Costs: Productivity losses from poor tooling UX'
- line: Yeah. Usually what happens is that developers may say, “Hey, this tool is
    cool. Let's integrate it.” They integrate it. In the end, you will have a platform
    that has a bunch of tools or libraries, or even multiple UIs. A person comes in
    to use it and they’re like, “Hey… Where should I even start?” Even though there
    is documentation, they will say “Hey, there is this tool for tracking. What about
    this tool?” There is a lack of consistency and a lack of UI. So in the end, what
    happens is – if you think about it, a data scientist’s salary is maybe 4000 euros
    on average – if the person is struggling to use this platform for two weeks, you're
    actually costing the business money. Let's take an example. Say two weeks is around
    2,000 euros and there are 50 users there. You're actually losing around 100,000
    euros. If you think about it like that, then you will see why you need some product
    managers to fix this.
  sec: 824
  time: '13:44'
  who: Geo
- line: How do you help to actually do this? You said you prioritize things, collect
    requirements, and the requirements come from different sources. So this can be
    something like – you saw a demo from some external tool or somebody complained
    to you about something. You take all this down and put it in a backlog, and then
    you prioritize the backlog. How do you do that?
  sec: 895
  time: '14:55'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Backlog Prioritization: Grooming with engineering and Agile practices'
- line: The prioritization process is done with the development team. We have engineering
    managers and usually, the product managers work very closely with engineering
    managers and the development team itself. The product managers try to define what
    the problem is, while the definition of the solution happens with the engineering
    team. All these discussions are part of our weekly grooming of the backlog. The
    product manager runs the sessions. For example, every week, we have an hour where
    we discuss the top priorities.
  sec: 919
  time: '15:19'
  who: Geo
- line: Then we decide together with the team by following some Agile methodologies
    or something like that to make sure we have deliveries. Once we agree on the backlog
    and time of delivery, we communicate back to the stakeholders, “Hey, data scientists
    requested this feature.” I will go back to the data scientists saying “We are
    actually working on this and you can expect this to be delivered in two weeks
    or four weeks or a month.”
  sec: 919
  time: '15:19'
  who: Geo
- line: Interesting. You mentioned one important thing – that your job as a product
    manager is to think about problems. So you define a problem? But then, you're
    not thinking about the solution, the engineering team thinks about the solution.
    Is that right?
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Outcome-Driven Problem Definition: Metrics over immediate solutions'
- line: Well, it's actually quite a complex topic to discuss. The danger is that often,
    people don't really understand the problem first, and they go directly into solutions
    instead. That's very dangerous, in my opinion. I have seen examples where people
    said to me, “Hey, I want to solve recommendations and multi-category recommendations
    will work. I read an article in Medium about it.” You can draw conclusions right
    away and say “This solution may work.” But it is also important that you validate
    your hypothesis, etc. As a product manager, I say what the desired outcome would
    be, but not the solution.
  sec: 1004
  time: '16:44'
  who: Geo
- line: Let's say I want the model training time to be reduced by X percent. Now the
    outcome is clear and the metric is clear. While the engineering team I work with
    will have to go back and forth. Now that the problem is clear and the outcome
    is clear, we just need to find how we reach that stage. It's always important
    that you define your problem clearly and decide what the outcome should be. The
    outcome is essentially how you will measure it. I think it's easy to say, but
    I spend a lot of time doing this.
  sec: 1004
  time: '16:44'
  who: Geo
- line: So, you mean KPIs and things like that, right? How can you measure that your
    platform is good? How do you measure it – if you reduce the time that a data scientist
    spent with your platform? It's very hard to track, right?
  sec: 1092
  time: '18:12'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'ML Observability: KPIs and measuring platform impact'
- line: These things are hard to track, so you have to build observability metrics.
    You need to push more metrics to maybe Datadog or whatever observability tools
    you're using. I would say this is an interesting topic that even industry is hard-pressed
    to answer sometimes. Because I think many of the ML Ops tools in the market don't
    have this answer yet. It's a problem I think everyone is trying to solve.
  sec: 1105
  time: '18:25'
  who: Geo
- line: Yeah. The question I actually had when asking that is – I know that you have
    an engineering background. You spent some time doing Java development and you
    spent some time doing data science. Maybe not now, but some time ago, you were
    quite hands-on. You still know how to do some things – you still remember and
    have this experience. So how do you make sure you don't jump into ‘solution mode’
    and that you don't start recommending teams what to do as a PM?
  sec: 1136
  time: '18:56'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Avoiding Solution Bias: Techniques to resist jumping into solutions'
- line: Yeah. That's actually a very good question. It's also one of the hardest things
    that you struggle with on a daily basis as a PM. I think it's the mindset of a
    PM where you need to actually think more about the problem itself. Sure, I think
    I want to jump into solutions, but mistakes are usually made because you can sometimes
    get too excited about a problem. But it's not like, “Stop being excited.” It's
    just about spending more time on understanding the problem itself and breaking
    it down into small pieces. That's one exercise that helps prevent me from going
    directly into solutions.
  sec: 1169

- line: When you start breaking down your problem into smaller pieces and figure out
    how to solve it, you essentially understand that, “I cannot think about one solution
    directly. It's not the right way and right time for me to do it. I should try
    to spend some time clarifying this problem and breaking it down into small pieces.”
    That's one way of doing it. The other one is that it just takes practice and consistent
    effort. Sometimes you do that as well. Then you will have to be realistic about
    it and say, “I did this and I need to make sure that I'm not doing it anymore.”
  sec: 1169
  time: '19:29'
  who: Geo
- line: Yeah. Interesting. You said you spend a lot of time trying to understand the
    problem and break it down. Do you do this alone or the whole team is involved?
    What does the process usually look like?

- header: 'Collaborative Problem Breakdown: Workshops, interviews, and user input'
- line: Yes, sometimes. The whole team is involved In some of the cases. It’s mostly
    with the actual users, which can depend on the job I do. In the previous job,
    it was sometimes with regulators or compliance managers and some customers. Right
    now, I mostly spend time with data scientists and take their feedback, do some
    brainstorming sessions. It may be just a small session where we do an exercise
    together and say, “Let's go deeper.” We list out all the problems and group the
    problems together. Usually, this involves workshops or customer interviews, or
    user interviews and things like that. This helps us to better clarify the problem.
    For the most part, I would say that we talk – communicate and understand each
    other. That's the way it usually works.

- header: 'Core PM Skills: Communication, prioritization, and continuous learning'
- line: Ideally, yes. I think those are the key drivers. As a product manager, most
    of your schedule is built around communication, so you spend a lot of time in
    discussions with people. Good communication is a very important skill to have.
    I also don't believe that everyone has this skill from day one. It takes time
    and practice. Prioritization is a key skill as well, which I would say is also
    not an easy thing to master. I know people with 10 or 20 years of product management
    experience and they still spend a lot of time developing this skill because it's
    not easy at all. You have many people with many requirements and all of them are
    important. So your job is to go back and be realistic in prioritizing things –
    What needs to be done? What brings value to customers?

- line: In my specific case, since I’m closer to the ML world, I would say it's also
    important to understand the market or where the industry is going with machine
    learning. This includes machine learning ops and engineering practices, cloud
    technologies, etc. You need to be constantly updated, because you may be solving
    the problem in a really wrong way or maybe you're not using the right tools. To
    avoid this, you need to be constantly learning about what's happening in the industry.
    Maybe this could be a review of some materials or participating in some events.
    Learning is very important, I would say.
  sec: 1408
  time: '23:28'
  who: Geo
- line: Secondly, I think you need to have an understanding of model architectures
    and other technical things, like building event streaming systems or Bats or Big
    Data-related knowledge and database-related knowledge. All this can help because,
    in the end, your communication is based on these topics. If you cannot understand
    or you cannot stay updated with it, you are going to struggle a lot as a product
    manager. You need to be really updated with what the technologies are in the company
    and how people are using them.
  sec: 1408
  time: '23:28'
  who: Geo
- line: There could be security-related issues from not knowing these things or it
    can be a wide range of other issues, so you need to have a good understanding
    of how it works. Otherwise it can turn into a bit of a disaster – being a product
    manager who communicates a lot but doesn't understand what's happening under the
    hood. For that, learning is quite important, I would say.
  sec: 1408
  time: '23:28'
  who: Geo

    product manager? I’m guessing you studied all the things you mentioned and you
    probably also know them from your work.

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Technical Background Value: Why platform PMs need tooling familiarity'
- line: We have different kinds of product managers and we can go into that later.
    But in my kind of role, I would say it's very important. If you're communicating
    with data scientists often, you need to understand things like the lifecycle of
    the model and how the model works. You need to have an understanding of algorithms,
    etc. So that's very important. On the other hand, you're also going back and talking
    to your team – which is essentially engineers who are building a platform – so
    you need to understand different cloud technologies, tooling, and Kubernetes (or
    whatever infrastructure solutions that you're using). You need to have an understanding
    of this as well. Some of the technologies I had to learn on the fly, because in
    Amadeus, the cloud platform we used was Redshift, which was a private cloud that
    is managed by Amadeus itself. It was like OpenShift and etc. That’s something
    you learn there.
  sec: 1531
  time: '25:31'
  who: Geo
- line: Then when I went to Revolute, it was fully on GCP. I was new to GCP at that
    time, and you just learn the concepts and understand what GCP offers, which could
    be dataflow, Pub/Sub, etc. Then you come to Glovo, where we are primarily using
    AWS. Now I'm in a new world of AWS. So it's just a matter of what you’re doing.
    I think the underlying concept is the same, but you just need to be really aware
    of what's happening in all of this as a technical product manager. Otherwise,
    I think you will struggle with prioritization, because you won't understand what
    to solve or you will struggle with how to solve it. When solutions are being discussed,
    you will feel like, “Hey, what's actually happening? I don't understand anything.”
    In very platform-specific technical roles, I would say, yes – it's very important
    to have technical knowledge.
  sec: 1531
  time: '25:31'
  who: Geo
- line: Thanks. We have quite an interesting question. What you described is, to some
    extent, quite similar to what I do. Although I'm not a product manager, there
    is some overlap, like discussing architecture, talking to data scientists and
    seeing what their problems are. I'm on the individual contributor track of data
    scientists, so the title is Principal Data Scientist. And the question that we
    have is, “What is the difference between the Data Team Lead and a Data PM?” In
    this case, I think the question is very similar to “What's the difference between,
    let's say, a Lead Data Scientist and Technical AI Product Manager?
  sec: 1649

    question correctly…
  sec: 1695
  time: '28:15'
  who: Geo

    level – after Senior. In some companies it’s called a Staff Data Scientist.
  sec: 1708
  time: '28:28'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Role Differences: Data Science Lead / Staff vs Technical ML Product Manager'
- line: Okay. Now I get it. I also work with Staff Data Scientists and Staff Engineers
    as well. The main difference is that they don't drive a roadmap. Or rather they
    may drive one of the items in the roadmap. For example, they may own a work stream
    or multiple work streams. I think they come in a lot when we are defining the
    solution, like I mentioned earlier. Product managers are usually the ones helping
    define the problem and the outcome, while lead or staff engineers are the first
    people who usually come to help me define the desired outcome, or the solution
    itself. So that's the first main thing.
  sec: 1717
  time: '28:37'
  who: Geo
- line: The second one is – I don't really go into the details of the quality of code.
    I don't go into the details of going into reviewing pull requests on a daily basis.
    I don't go into any technical architectural decision-making. I do say my input
    – that's always welcomed – but it's not my expected responsibility to go and make
    this decision. I think this is what’s usually done by the data science leads or
    staff data scientists.
  sec: 1717
  time: '28:37'
  who: Geo
- line: Then there’s also the model architecture. What I will be interested in is
    mostly the results. “What was your hypothesis? How did you test it? What's the
    outcome of your A/B tests? How did we add value?” That would be what I would be
    interested in rather than saying “I chose a deep learning model” or something
    like that. In terms of this decision making, I am only interested in the outcome,
    while the lead or the staff data scientist is going to actually work on the architecture
    and understand how I translate these problems into actual requirements and work
    on it.
  sec: 1717
  time: '28:37'
  who: Geo
- line: Actually the question was the difference between the Data Team Lead and the
    Data PM – I think I slightly rephrased it because I was more interested in hearing
    the difference between individual contributors and product managers. But let's
    say that this person is a data science manager – they are the Data Team Lead or
    whatever you want to call them. So what's the difference here apart from having
    to manage people?

  time: '31:21'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Release Governance & Rollout Strategy: Approvals, compliance, and timing'
- line: Sure, definitely. Usually data science leads will have ownership of multiple
    scopes within the same product. Let's say a product is for recommendations and
    these recommendations may have multiple types. This is a bigger scope. What I've
    seen is that the data science lead would own the full direction of this project,
    while the product manager is very much focused on the customer side, like “Where
    will this recommendation be placed in the UI?” The product manager also works
    with the UX or designers to design what the display will look like. There is also
    backend that’s involved in this model process – you need to integrate your models
    into the backend. The product manager acts as the center point of contact for
    that and ensures that the collaboration is happening effectively with backend
    and data science lead and their data scientists as well.
  sec: 1888
  time: '31:28'
  who: Geo
- line: Importantly, the product manager also defines the rollout strategy. Let's
    say I have a model that is performing really well. When should I go to the market
    with it? Do we need to do any marketing campaigns for it? This is defined by the
    product manager. While the data science lead’s input is always welcomed, it's
    not something that they actually do on a daily basis. Sometimes governance is
    a big factor – data science models that need to be regulated and need to undergo
    an approval from a governance board. The product manager is actually the one who
    collects the results with data science leads and data scientists, and can go to
    the governance board and say, “Hey, these are the results and this is the outcome.
    Can you please approve it?” This is the business use case. These kinds of external
    communications, approvals, governance – that’s all monitored by the product manager
    and not data science leads.
  sec: 1888
  time: '31:28'
  who: Geo
- line: It seems like product managers have more responsibilities here because this
    is them saying, “This should be approved.” Especially when it comes to regulations,
    the liability or responsibility is much greater. It’s ultimately the PM’s decision
    to go with a particular model.
  sec: 2027
  time: '33:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Essentially, it can really affect your regulatory licensing, or it
    can be money laundering regulation, or other things like that. This can potentially
    lead to huge fines, and other negative circumstances, like what happened with
    Zillow, that everyone is talking about now. But it’s similar for banking, it can
    happen as well. But I think in financial tech, I have seen these deeper regulations
    and governance being put in place because of the nature of the business. For Glovo,
    this hasn’t happened yet. I don't think it's that regulated. There is regulation
    for a lot of things, but it's not a very strict governance process for model release
    as of yet. I think people who are working in FinTech can relate to this more.
  sec: 2050
  time: '34:10'
  who: Geo
- line: Also as an internal PM, maybe you need to deal less with these kinds of things.
    You mentioned thinking about time to go to market and about marketing. I’m guessing
    this is out of scope for you right now.
  sec: 2101
  time: '35:01'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Adoption Strategy: "Time to stakeholders" and internal rollouts'
- line: Right now, yes. But I would still say that some of the features and capabilities
    that we release, it is also important for me to understand who will adopt it and
    how many people will use it. It's not feasible for everyone in the company to
    adopt the capability of the platform, so we need to understand who is going to
    adopt it and when. So this is a sort of “time to market”, or rather “time to stakeholders”
    where we need to consider how we roll out and adoption. Therefore, you need to
    align that with them as well.
  sec: 2118
  time: '35:18'

    have a market, right?
  sec: 2156
  time: '35:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say it’s negligible compared to millions of users. But I think these
    people are the hardest because everyone has a say, since they speak to you on
    a daily basis. But with a customer group, you actually may just release it to
    beta and go into millions of users right away. There are pros and cons in both
    ways of thinking about it.

    even for the ML ops platform that I'm doing. We do have two data scientists as
    well. Currently, they are part of the engineering team, because I'm still structuring
    the teams there. At some point, we want the data scientists to be in an independent
    team. It's an exceptional scenario right now – that the team that I'm working
    with has two data scientists embedded into the engineering team. Ideally, in other
    teams in Glovo, the engineering team is usually just the backend engineers or
    system engineers, development engineers, and data engineers. Often they don't
    really have any data scientists as part of the engineering team.

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Engineering Roles in ML Platforms: Backend, syseng, CI/CD, and K8s'
- line: We define the user journey of the data scientists starting with offline experimentation,
    such as what notebooks are offering infrastructure for this. Then you have data
    management, which is a huge area. You need to integrate with the data lake, data
    warehouse, feature store, etc. For this data management-related tooling, we have
    the backend engineers building tooling around it. Then, some of the data quality-related
    tooling, like Great Expectations, integrating these libraries with our platform
    – this is done by backend engineers.
  sec: 2268
  time: '37:48'
  who: Geo
- line: Then we have model training infrastructure. We allow data scientists to schedule
    workflows for model training, which are essentially model training jobs that can
    be scheduled and run on a daily basis or weekly, based on the business requirement.
    This has underlying infrastructure, which is Kubernetes, because we are using
    Argo right now. This is managed by system engineers, or people with Kubernetes
    knowledge. Then once the model is trained, you need to go into the deployment
    phase.
  sec: 2268
  time: '37:48'
  who: Geo
- line: The model needs to be productionized, so it could be served via an API, or
    it could be a basic consumption of key value store. It's a batch consumption of
    reinforcement learning, based on the approach. All this requires CI/CD pipelines,
    which is probably Jenkins, plus we also have Spinnaker for it. All this is managed
    within the platform and any bugs in this are fixed by these engineers. If something
    breaks when a data scientist is trying to deploy something, we have an internal
    Help Center, in which they raise a ticket to us saying that they have an issue.
    If it's a high priority, we prioritize it and try to fix it. So it's a mixture
    of system engineers and backend engineers. We don't have a service, but at some
    point, we would like to have one to maintain the infrastructure part.
  sec: 2268

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Embedded Data Scientists: Power users, developer advocates, and demos'

    parts of the user journey right now. They are very focused on tooling, such as
    data science tooling, A/B testing tools, data quality tools. We also have a core
    library of the platform, which they manage as well. The core library of the platform
    also has integrations with Standard BS libraries, like NumPy and Pandas. All of
    this is managed by data scientists.
  sec: 2414
  time: '40:14'
  who: Geo
- line: At some point, they also act as accelerators, like power users of the platform.
    Let's say another data scientist is joining the company and he has a new model.
    When he tries to use our platform, these data scientists are more like consultants
    to him saying, “Hey, this is how you should do it.” They will help him with the
    best practices in the platform, and sort of guide him through using the platform
    in an effective manner.

  sec: 2485
  time: '41:25'
  who: Alexey

    modeling for internal purposes. We have some dummy models that we use. For instance,
    recently, one of them did a model for predicting how many Jira tickets we would
    get on a weekly basis. It’s a very simple model, but it's just used for us to
    manage the lifecycle of the platform. We can use this for tutorials and writing
    demos, etc.

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Agile for Data Science: Kanban, Scrum, and adapting to research work'
- line: There is no best way, in my opinion. I don't think that there is a singular
    answer to this. I think it's very subjective to the team, the company, and the
    culture. You need to try different methodologies accordingly. When I started in
    the role, there was nothing like that. My job was to build a team, so we weren't
    doing any Scrum or anything like that. We just had a to-do list. Then we reached
    the stage where we had a few people, so we decided to maybe do Kanban. We just
    had a high priority list and we just did the tasks on it.
  sec: 2534
  time: '42:14'
  who: Geo
- line: Then we reached the stage, “Okay, now we are in governance. We need to make
    releases. Okay, let's do Scrum.” So I think it's an iterative and adaptive process.
    I personally don't think it's good to say, “Hey, this is not going to work” without
    trying it. Scum has been around for maybe 20 years or so. It's used often and
    it can work. I know that in some places it doesn't work. So you need to understand
    what the needs of the team actually are. Maybe some teams are research-oriented,
    like R&D teams, they may not need Scrum. It depends on the scope of the business,
    where you are, and how you want to deliver. That's my personal take on this one.
  sec: 2534
  time: '42:14'
  who: Geo
- line: I haven't worked in Scrum in like five or six years. But what I remember as
    the main problem with this is that data science projects are usually not very
    deterministic. Sometimes it's hard to say, “Okay, this will take 5 story points
    or 20 story points.” So I guess that's the main problem. Then at the end of the
    sprint, you say, “Yeah, that didn't work.”
  sec: 2626
  time: '43:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I understand what you mean. It depends. I'm just saying that in terms
    of Agile practices, you can try Kanban – then it may work. You don't need to size
    all the points. That's why we are retrospectives. We speak with the team to understand
    what's working and what's not. Product managers should also do this because in
    the end, it's affecting the delivery. You need high quality delivery and everyone
    in the team should be satisfied with it. Product managers have a very important
    responsibility to do that as well.

    work and focus more on defining problems rather than solutions.” So from the moment

    before I started my first job. I was in different communities in product management.
    I read a few books about product management. I was constantly reviewing talks,
    which were something like “product school.” I think it's very popular now. They
    were doing something like what you are doing for data science, but they were doing
    it for product management. There were a lot of product managers coming from Google,
    Facebook, and speaking about product management.
  sec: 2726
  time: '45:26'
  who: Geo
- line: I also closely worked with a few product managers in order to understand how
    they are doing the solutions and everything. Slowly, I realized that I already
    did a lot of product management when I was doing my blogging – when I was maintaining
    my own website. I realized slowly, “Hey, I actually did some product management
    before because I was building a UI which is used by quite a few people. I was
    trying to make revenue out of it by placing ads in the right places.” Even in
    the data science lifecycle, you spend a lot of time understanding the business,
    and therefore you are actually doing some amount of product management already.
    It’s a matter of how you take it to the next level.
  sec: 2726
  time: '45:26'
  who: Geo
- line: I just translated everything I did into a product mindset to say that, “Hey,
    I built websites that were having X number of visitors and that generated X amount
    of revenue.” I just updated my CV with that. Then I thought about the data science
    projects I did. For instance, I was working for a chatbot project. I was collecting
    the requirements, speaking to the client all the time because there was no product
    manager. Then I was leading the product for six months in India, and I delivered
    the output as a chatbot. Then I took feedback from him. I built metrics to monitor
    it, like, “What was the satisfaction score of the chatbot? What was the sentiment
    score of the chatbot?” So when you think about it, I actually did some product
    management there.
  sec: 2726
  time: '45:26'
  who: Geo
- line: All these projects, I correlated into something that was more like product
    management. I knew that I applied for a job that I was not really qualified for,
    because I was certain that I was under-qualified. But I still gave it a try. At
    the time, Revolute was quite open about these things and they wanted someone with
    a data science background. This was actually quite a hard combination to find,
    so I had plus points there going in. And it helped.
  sec: 2726
  time: '45:26'
  who: Geo
- line: It took me some time to prepare for it and to translate everything into a
    product mindset – a lot of reading, speaking with a lot of people, and understanding
    it all. As I said, you cannot learn product management just by reading, you need
    to do it. So I did some projects as well, which helped me to communicate that
    I was doing X and delivering value. I think that was a simple process. I mean,
    I can't really say simple, but that was the process.

- line: Okay. So basically, as a data scientist, you were already in quite a good
    position to move more into the business side of things – into the product side
    of things. As a data scientist, you have to do these things anyway. You have to
    understand your domain and work closely with product managers. Then you can just
    do more of that, right? Eventually, you partner with your product manager and
    maybe take part of the responsibility. That’s the way to do it?
  sec: 2938
  time: '48:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. That's how I transition. I was doing exactly the thing you
    described.
  sec: 2969
  time: '49:29'
  who: Geo
- line: You also said that you took some time to prepare and that you did some reading.
    Do you remember what kind of reading you did? What did you read?
  sec: 2976
  time: '49:36'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Recommended Resources: Books and communities for PM transition'
- line: Yeah. There are books called “How to Crack a PM Interview” and “How to Crack
    a Coding Interview.” I read the coding interview one when I was applying for engineering
    jobs. After that, I read Cracking the PM Interview. I think there are a lot of
    materials out there about product management, especially those that come from
    product managers themselves, because all these scale-up startups are doing a lot
    of stuff. I think “How to Crack a PM Interview” was one thing that helped.
  sec: 2983
  time: '49:43'
  who: Geo
- line: Then there's also “The Lean Startup” book by Eric Ries. I think that mentions
    the importance of measuring things and going in with a lean philosophy, which
    is a very key value and important in product management. The other thing is, I
    also constantly listened to a lot of people speaking. For instance, as I mentioned,
    things like not jumping directly into solutions.
  sec: 2983
  time: '49:43'
  who: Geo
- line: Another important thing is – you also shouldn't make a lot of assumptions
    in product management. These are the kinds of things you learn by doing and by
    listening to people. We are wired to make assumptions, but I have seen cases where
    one wrong assumption can turn into a lot of bad business issues. These are the
    kinds of things you only learn by doing stuff, observing, and speaking to people.
    You learn from experience as well, over time.
  sec: 2983
  time: '49:43'
  who: Geo
- line: Okay. As data scientists, people should get more into pairing with a product
    manager, then reading “Cracking a PM Interview” and “The Lean Startup” books.
    And also by just talking to product people. That's the summary?
  sec: 3079
  time: '51:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's the small summary, I would say.
  sec: 3096
  time: '51:36'
  who: Geo
- line: And do this for two years. Right? [laughs]
  sec: 3097
  time: '51:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. This is like a summary of what I did for two-three years. I think it
    also depends on your manager as well. Once you start in the product area, if your
    manager is quite good, he can be your mentor as well if he's giving you good feedback.
    If not, you should definitely find someone to mentor you. It's important to have
    a good product mentor. Also, I think the Airbnb Chief Product Officer, (I forgot
    his name) writes a lot on product management as well. I follow a lot of product
    people in my LinkedIn and other social networks. I get random thoughts here and
    there, which are like food for thought. That’s important as well.
  sec: 3079
  time: '51:19'
  who: Geo
- line: Okay, thanks. What do you think about people who do not work as data scientists
    right now? Or engineers? Can they become machine learning product managers?
  sec: 3150
  time: '52:30'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Non-Technical Transitions: Feasibility of moving into ML product roles'
- line: It's easier for them to become a traditional software engineering PMs, I would
    say. Because in this role, you go into writing specifications, understanding the
    requirements, etc.. If they have some understanding of machine learning philosophy,
    yes – it will work. But a 100% immediate transition may not be that easy. However,
    I would never say a hard ‘no’ to it. I think some people are very good at learning.
    So if they can learn the philosophies and understand how an AI project is structured,
    I think they can do it as well. In the end, most of the things I mentioned, or
    the things I do as an AI product manager – I think 80% is the same as normal product
    management. It's just that 20%, where I add more value with my background.
  sec: 3165
  time: '52:45'
  who: Geo
- line: If you're an engineer, you could add this 20%, but you may need to learn a
    bit more about AI product management. This shouldn't be stopping you from applying
    into ML product management jobs. That's just my personal take. It also depends
    on companies. Some companies are like, “I want someone like this, this, this.”
    And some of them are more flexible. Therefore, you need to find people who are
    going to trust you and give you that kind of opportunity to join.
  sec: 3165
  time: '52:45'
  who: Geo
- line: You mentioned that you applied for a job that you weren't qualified for. I
    guess when you read the job description, you never know whether the people on
    the other side will give you this opportunity to learn or not. So the only way
    to find out is just to apply and see what happens, right?
  sec: 3255
  time: '54:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Definitely. I think that's the philosophy. Also, when I was applying
    to Revolute, I really liked the product and was using it for two years. So when
    they spoke with me, I knew a lot about the product and they knew that I had a
    clear passion to do something to help their business. This was helpful for me
    to join them as a Product Manager. I think sometimes, if you can clearly showcase
    your passion and your interest in this domain, I think it is possible to crack
    into it.
  sec: 3275
  time: '54:35'
  who: Geo
- line: Interesting. Thanks. We have quite a few questions, but I don't think we'll
    be able to cover all of them. But let's try to cover at least a couple. There
    is a question from Eva, which reads “How do you deal with user research and the
    result? How does it influence your work?”
  sec: 3317
  time: '55:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: My research?
  sec: 3338
  time: '55:38'
  who: Geo
- line: Yeah, so how do you deal with user research? Do you do user research at all?
  sec: 3339
  time: '55:39'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'User Research for Internal Platforms: Surveys and Happiness Reports'
- line: Yeah. User research, in my case, I'm assuming is more the data scientists
    and how they're using the platform. Right now, what I do is speak with data scientists
    and data science leads on a monthly basis. We have follow up sessions with them
    about feedback. We frequently do surveys, like once every two months, about feedback
    and which capabilities are being used. Then we produce something called a Happiness
    Report for the internal platform. Let's say, for this platform, our customers
    like the features and they are using them.
  sec: 3344
  time: '55:44'
  who: Geo
- line: However, the complaints they usually have are about documentation and its
    lack of quality, and perhaps some lack of stability in certain areas. Then we
    come back, I share this knowledge with the team and say, “This is the feedback
    we got. How can we work on it?” So when I prioritize my objectives or key results
    for the next quarter, or even for a sprint, I try to address some of these challenges
    in an ongoing way. It's also an objective of mine as a product manager, to increase
    the usability of the platform. To do this, we constantly speak to the customers
    to understand what the users need. Then we translate that into our objectives
    and use some initiatives to keep it up.
  sec: 3344
  time: '55:44'
  who: Geo
- line: Thanks. Another question from Eva is, “What do you think about quality assurance
    people? What is their role in ML products?”
  sec: 3429
  time: '57:09'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'ML Quality Assurance: Model validation, shadowing, and release checklists'
- line: We didn't have QAs in the last two companies I worked – Typical QAs, if I
    understand the question correctly. In Revolute, the expectation is that the engineers,
    data scientists, and MLEs should do the QA of their own code. As a product manager,
    I had a checklist for each release, especially if my product was a governance
    product. There were five different benchmarks to be passed for a model to go into
    production. Let's say there is a new version of your model – we first tested it
    using historical data for maybe six months to see how the model performs. Then
    we took some publicly available industry benchmarks for the same use case and
    we validated it using that. Then we also had a labeled ‘gold’ dataset as well.
    After that, we shadowed it in the production with actual live traffic and looked
    at the results from that.
  sec: 3440
  time: '57:20'
  who: Geo
- line: So we had this quality control process for models that the data science team
    and I worked with. Every model and every version of a model we created, we tested
    it in this manner and slowly rolled it out this way. That was the quality control
    that we did at my last job. Here, in the platform team, it’s usually the engineers
    themselves that check QA. They write their own tests and we try to make sure that
    we have good test coverage and everything. So, in the end, I don't think everything
    is perfect, since people always have bugs. If you don't have bugs, I don't think
    you're doing your job correctly. [laughs]
  sec: 3440
  time: '57:20'
  who: Geo
- line: Yeah, thanks. Do you have a couple more minutes?
  sec: 3562
  time: '59:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure.
  sec: 3564
  time: '59:24'
  who: Geo
- line: There is another question also from Eva. Thanks Eva for asking questions.
    “Do you have any tips for somebody who is working as a scrum master right now
    (someone who is totally new to machine learning) and they need to support a machine
    learning team. Do you have any advice for this kind of person? What can they do
    to support the teams better?”
  sec: 3562
  time: '59:22'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Scrum Master to PM Advice: Leverage Agile skills and learn ML basics'
- line: I am not sure I understood the question correctly. Usually, a scrum master,
    if I understand the role, is mostly about running Agile practices. This is something
    I also do sometimes as a product manager. If the question refers to extending
    the scope of this role, you just need to take more time in the problem definition
    part and work with the product manager to define the problem properly. As a Scrum
    master, you are likely already quite experienced in delivering the product. You
    know how to prioritize your backlog, which is a great asset for any good PM.
  sec: 3592
  time: '59:52'
  who: Geo
- line: Even though Agile philosophies are not directly mentioned in PM interviews,
    most companies value having a good Agile background quite a lot. How to prioritize
    your backlog, how to deliver a roadmap – all of this is very important. I also
    think the extension involves thinking about how to create a roadmap rather than
    someone creating it for you. Again, you need to work with your PM to say, “Hey,
    maybe for this project, I can create a roadmap. And I can deliver it.” So I don't
    think the transition is super hard, because I have seen a lot of Scrum masters
    coming into product management. A lot of business analysts come into product management
    as well.
  sec: 3592
  time: '59:52'
  who: Geo
- line: But if you want to become a machine learning product manager, you also need
    to learn a bit of machine learning.
  sec: 3691
  time: '1:01:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, you definitely need to learn machine learning as well. Yeah.
  sec: 3696
  time: '1:01:36'
  who: Geo
- line: Okay. Yeah, thanks. I think we should be wrapping up. Is there anything else
    you would like to mention before we finish?
  sec: 3702
  time: '1:01:42'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Final Thoughts: PM demands, scope, and career realities'
- line: No. I just wanted to say thanks a lot for inviting me to share. Also one thing
    about product management – I think it's also important that people don't think
    this job is quite “chill.” It's a very demanding job. You should always think
    about how to get out of your comfort zone on a frequent basis. Sometimes I'm doing
    the job of product manager, I'm doing product ownership, scrum master work. Sometimes
    when the EM is not there, I have to cover for engineering management. So there
    are a lot of responsibilities. But it's super exciting because you get to see
    the wider picture of the business. You can see how you can contribute and add
    more and more value to the business. I'm happy if anyone has any feedback or any
    questions. Or if someone wants to join Glovo, we are hiring data product managers.
    So yeah, please reach out to me, I'll be happy to help.
  sec: 3711
  time: '1:01:51'
  who: Geo
- line: Is it only for people who are in Barcelona? Or you're also hiring remotely?
  sec: 3773
  time: '1:02:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: We have remote teams, actually. We started some remote teams – we call it
    Project Jupiter, but it’s more of an experiment. We have some engineering teams
    that are remote. Glovo is not traditionally a remote-first company because it's
    very operations heavy. In engineering we are opening a few remote positions, but
    we also have tech hubs in Madrid, Warsaw, and in Barcelona. So if you're based
    there, it's perfect. If not, there are few remote roles as well. We are hiring
    a lot of data managers as well.
