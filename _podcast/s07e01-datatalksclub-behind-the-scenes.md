transcript:
- line: "Welcome to another session of the DataTalks.Club podcast. It's a bit unusual\
    \ today. Well, Alexey is here and I'm here, but instead of Alexey hosting the\
    \ podcast \u2013 this time, I'm going to be hosting it and I'm going to be grilling\
    \ him with questions. So a bit about Alexey and I \u2013 we've known each other\
    \ for about\u2026How long has it been, Alexey? A year or two?"
  sec: 9
  time: 0:09
  who: Eugene
- line: Something between that.
  sec: 30
  time: 0:30
  who: Alexey
- header: "Alexey\u2019s background"
- line: "Yeah, we met a long time ago, I can't remember how. But we started chatting.\
    \ Since then, we've been chatting every other month. Through that, I've seen how\
    \ Alexey has come to the crazy idea of wanting to start his community. I thought\
    \ it was crazy. I was like, \u201CWell, it's a lot of work.\u201D And I've seen\
    \ him really grow it to the amazing community it is today. I've always had a lot\
    \ of questions for him. Today, I'm going to be taking my chance. But first, let\
    \ us try to learn more about Alexey, the person he is at work. So Alexey, in 2010,\
    \ you graduated with a degree in Information Technology and became a software\
    \ engineer mostly focused on Java. Fast forward more than 10 years later \u2013\
    \ you're now a principal data scientist at OLX. How did that happen?"
  sec: 33
  time: 0:33
  who: Eugene
- line: "Yeah, so that's a long story. I don't know how I can compress 10 years into\
    \ a few minutes. I'll try to be brief. Actually, Eugene interviewed me half a\
    \ year ago or something like that. There is a long article that he also published\
    \ on Towards Data Science. So if you want to have to know a longer version of\
    \ that, you can go check out that article. But yeah, my background is in Java\
    \ development, and I was doing that for a couple of years. Then, one day, I came\
    \ across this website called Coursera. Maybe some of you heard about it. On this\
    \ website, there was a course called \u2018machine learning\u2019. I watched that\
    \ course, which is by Andrew Ng from Stanford, and I really loved it. I thought,\
    \ \u201COkay, I think I'm wasting my time doing this Java stuff, I should do something\
    \ else. I should actually use some of the math skills I picked up at university\
    \ and do this kind of stuff.\u201D"
  sec: 86
  time: '1:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: "So I started doing more courses and then I started interviewing with companies.\
    \ They said, \u201CYeah, you don't have enough experience or enough education.\u201D\
    \ As a result I joined a Master's program, and at the same time, I started freelancing.\
    \ It was actually very easy to start freelancing. I was surprised by that. Fast\
    \ forward two years, I got a portfolio with my freelance projects, with my Master's\
    \ diploma thesis, and that was enough to get a job. Since then, I've been doing\
    \ data science full time. My engineering background was very helpful in getting\
    \ my first job as a data scientist."
  sec: 86
  time: '1:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Then at the second company where I worked, I focused more on actually engineering\
    \ things \u2013 setting up the infrastructure, taking care of all of these data\
    \ pipelines, and all that. Because there was nobody else who wanted to do that\
    \ and I thought, \u201COkay, maybe this could be me who takes care of that.\u201D\
    \ And it worked out really well. Back then \u2013 and I think this is still true\
    \ today \u2013 companies really value this kind of experience. A lot of people\
    \ who took the courses know how to train a model in Jupyter Notebook, but what's\
    \ after that? How can you deploy these things? Or before that \u2013 how can you\
    \ work on data pipelines? Having this experience that I got at the startup really\
    \ helped me in basically every place where I interviewed \u2013 everyone was interested\
    \ in that."
  sec: 86
  time: '1:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Also, the experience I got from a startup, doing a bit of everything, was\
    \ also very helpful in a corporate environment. OLX, where I work now, is more\
    \ like a corporation than a startup. I've been with OLX for more than three years\
    \ \u2013 I joined as a senior data scientist. I think I was doing a pretty good\
    \ job since I got promoted two times there. I have a pretty good manager who noticed\
    \ that all my efforts and I got a few promotions. Yeah, I guess that's it \u2013\
    10 years of experience condensed into a couple of minutes."
  sec: 86
  time: '1:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Nice. Thank you for sharing that with us. Do you have any lessons from your
    experience that you have gotten so far?
  sec: 297
  time: '4:57'
  who: Eugene
- line: "Maybe not lessons, but my advice would be \u2013 you don't have to stay within\
    \ your comfort zone. Try to step outside of your responsibilities. This is what\
    \ I did with all the setting data pipelines and whatnot. That really helped. This\
    \ opened the door to many, many opportunities. I think that's one thing. The other\
    \ thing is very similar. It's not only about technology, it's not only about engineering\
    \ \u2013 also try to get into product development. Try to understand and try to\
    \ learn from your product manager. They're there for a reason. They make sure\
    \ that we, as a team, are working on the right thing. So try to learn from them."
  sec: 306
  time: '5:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I did these two things and that was quite helpful in my career. Another lesson\
    \ that may be something that I learned the hard way is \u2013 don't chase the\
    \ exciting things. If there is a neural network that can do amazing things, it\
    \ doesn't mean that you need that network for your business problem. Most likely,\
    \ a couple of \u2018if statements\u2019 will be enough or maybe logistic regression\
    \ or something like that."
  sec: 306
  time: '5:06'
  who: Alexey
- header: Being a principal data scientist
- line: "Cool. Thank you for that, Alexey. I have one other question. You shared with\
    \ us about all the technical stuff that you did early in your career. But now\
    \ that you're a principal data scientist \u2013 now you're someone more senior\
    \ \u2013 can you share a bit about what you do in your work? I guess this is a\
    \ question for people out there who are thinking, \u201CWhat does a senior data\
    \ scientist actually do? Or principal data scientists \u2013 what do they do?\u201D"
  sec: 387
  time: '6:27'
  who: Eugene
- line: "Yeah. You can think of me as an internal consultant. We have a lot of teams\
    \ at OLX who work on different things. We have a team that works on moderation,\
    \ a team that works on search and recommendation, a team that works on other things.\
    \ We have about six teams or something along those lines. I'm like a consultant\
    \ to these teams. I don't belong to any particular team but if somebody needs\
    \ help with something, I come there and help. Usually, this is about things like\
    \ this \u2013 let's say somebody comes up with a model and they want to find out\
    \ what's the best way of deploying this model. Or before that \u2013 before we\
    \ even start working on a project, sometimes product managers reach out to me\
    \ saying, \u201CHey, can you help us figure out if machine learning is actually\
    \ needed here?\u201D Or \u201CHow would you go about using machine learning here?\
    \ What kind of data do we need?\u201D"
  sec: 412
  time: '6:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: "So I do a lot of consultancy, sort of, and I also do a lot of coordinating\
    \ and alignment. Since I don't belong to any particular team, I can see what other\
    \ teams are working on. I know what kind of projects they work on and when a new\
    \ project starts, I can say, \u201CWait a minute. This looks similar to what the\
    \ other team did one year ago. Go talk to them.\u201D I need to do this kind of\
    \ thing quite often and say \u201CTalk to this team.\u201D Or \u201CTalk to that\
    \ team.\u201D Also, maybe the last bit is taking part in architectural discussions,\
    \ or making technical decisions that affect many teams, like, \u201CHow do we\
    \ standardize the way we're doing data science?\u201D Even things like \u201C\
    What kind of package manager will we use so that it\u2019s uniform across all\
    \ the teams?\u201D"
  sec: 412
  time: '6:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Maybe one last aspect is mentoring and education, like courses. For example,\
    \ the last course I did was on machine learning for product managers, the goal\
    \ of which is to tell them why we need machine learning, what is possible to do\
    \ with machine learning, and things like that. Then there\u2019s also mentoring\
    \ people. For example, let's say we have an analyst who wants to become a data\
    \ scientist \u2013 what do they need to do to make the transition? Or maybe there\
    \ is a data engineer who wants to become a machine learning engineer. Or sometimes,\
    \ like a couple of years ago, we had this discussion about \u201CWho is a machine\
    \ learning engineer? What kind of responsibilities do they have?\u201D So we sat\
    \ down with other teams and defined these responsibilities. That's also something\
    \ that I do."
  sec: 412
  time: '6:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That's very high leverage work \u2013 getting teams to talk to each other\
    \ to make sure that they don't reinvent the wheel, removing unnecessary work,\
    \ and also educating people and creating courses. I can sort of see where the\
    \ motivation comes from to start Data Talks Club. I remember more than a year\
    \ ago, at the end of 2020, I think, Alexey mentioned this idea of building a community,\
    \ which turned out to be Data Talks Club. Now I think he has almost 9,000 or maybe\
    \ 10,000 already."

  sec: 604
  time: '10:04'
  who: Alexey
- header: DataTalks.Club
- line: Almost 10. That's pretty crazy. Can you take us back to the very beginning?
    What gave you this idea?
  sec: 605
  time: '10:05'
  who: Eugene
- line: "Even before I started my career, even before I had my first computer, communities\
    \ were already a part of my life. I was interested in programming. Actually, I\
    \ did have a computer, but I didn't have internet. I became interested in programming.\
    \ I had Delphi by Borland, which is a programming language based on Pascal. I\
    \ needed to do some stuff there, but without the internet, it's very difficult.\
    \ The \u2018help\u2019 when you press F1, wasn't super helpful, it was also in\
    \ English and I didn't speak English that well back then. So I had to rely on\
    \ others to help me with that. For me, it was a community."
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: I found online forums where developers who like Delphi were hanging out. I
    had to actually go to my mom's place or my father's place to access the internet.
    I would go to the forums and ask them for advice. Sometimes, after a couple of
    months or half a year, I would also jump in and answer questions. That was great.
    When I was at university, when I already had access to the internet, I was a part
    of many different online communities, not only development-related, but also some
    hobbies. For example, I was into bootleg music. So this is when you go to a concert,
    like a metal band concert, for example and you film the concert, and then you
    exchange with other enthusiasts. I was really into these online communities. And
    then I became a Java developer. The first thing I did was register at Java Talks,
    which was an online community for people who are Java developers. And this is
    actually where the name comes from, for Data Talks Club. I was inspired by that
    name. So I just started answering questions in that community. After a couple
    of months, people thought that I was a super-experienced person who knows everything.
    I wasn't. I was a junior. I had no clue what I was talking about. But in people's
    minds, I was somebody who knew the answer to everything. That was a really nice
    experience.
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Then the same thing happened when I decided to switch from Java development\
    \ to data science. I joined a couple of online communities and I tried answering\
    \ questions there. That also helped in getting to know things \u2013 to see what\
    \ doesn't work for people, where they get stuck, what they need help with. So\
    \ I did some research and put in the answers. For me, communities were a big part\
    \ of my life. At some point, like in 2020, I was quite active on LinkedIn. I would\
    \ do a post every day with different career advice, like Daliana is doing right\
    \ now. So I was doing that sort of thing. I was getting a lot of questions in\
    \ direct messages on LinkedIn, where people would say, \u201CHey, I have this\
    \ situation, can you help me?\u201D Or \u201CI have that situation, can you help\
    \ me?\u201D"
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I was also doing some career consultation. I would have a 30-minute Zoom\
    \ call with people where they would ask me different questions. The funny thing\
    \ is, sometimes people would come to me and say, \u201CHey, I am a QA engineer.\
    \ How do I switch to product management?\u201D I have no idea. I am not a QA engineer.\
    \ I don't know anything about product management. But the funny thing is that\
    \ I was able to actually help them by just listening and asking, \u201CHey, but\
    \ what do you like more?\u201D Then people would just talk and then this rubber\
    \ duck thing kicks in where they just need to talk to somebody in order to make\
    \ a decision. So I was doing that for a couple of months."
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Then I thought, \u201COkay. It would be nice to take all these direct messages\
    \ I get from LinkedIn and somehow scale that.\u201D Because it wasn't easy to\
    \ answer each and every one of them. Then the second thing was all these consultation\
    \ calls that I had and \u201CHow about putting all these people together in some\
    \ place and having them talk to each other?\u201D This is how the idea for Data\
    \ Talks Club appeared. I thought that they needed a place to hang out together.\
    \ I woke up. I went to GoDaddy. I registered the domain there. It took, I don't\
    \ know, 10 minutes. Then I went to MailChimp and I set up a landing page, it also\
    \ took like 10 minutes. Then I put a link to a few places, mostly on my GitHub\
    \ account. So then, when people would reach out to me, I would say, \u201CHere's\
    \ this community. You can actually not only ask me a question, but also get an\
    \ answer from others. So join it.\u201D And people would DM me, and I will reply\
    \ with that or they would just stumble upon my GitHub and find the link there\
    \ and also join. Yeah, it got some traction."
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I started talking to people. I started asking them different questions, like\
    \ \u201CHey, what do you do? Why did you join? What brought you here?\u201D It\
    \ was going quite well. We had the first event, which also attracted quite a few\
    \ people. Also, you probably know Demetrios from the ML Ops community, they also\
    \ have a podcast. So I was a guest on his podcast. I really liked the format,\
    \ the way he invited people, basically what we are doing right now. We are having\
    \ an interview, but it's live. People can join, ask questions, and then it\u2019\
    s recorded and released as a podcast. So I really liked that format and I decided\
    \ to try something similar. Yeah, so this is how it started."

- line: I recall that you shared some statistics with me. I think in the first month
    the growth was pretty bad compared to six months later. What happened? Could you
    refresh your memory about how the Data Talks community grew?
  sec: 998
  time: '16:38'
  who: Eugene
- line: "I don't remember the numbers. I think, the first year \u2013 by the end of\
    \ 2020 \u2013 we had like 500 people. By the end of 2021, it was 9000. So yeah.\
    \ What I did the first month, I think I told you, was welcome everyone in the\
    \ community \u2013 I was trying to get to know them. I was trying to ask what\
    \ brought them here and trying to learn what kind of problems they have, what\
    \ people are interested in, and what I can do to solve their problems. This is\
    \ what I was doing the first month, welcoming people, trying to understand what\
    \ kind of problems they have."
  sec: 1014
  time: '16:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That actually doesn't scale well when more people join, so at some point,\
    \ I just stopped doing that. When three, four people join per day, I can do that.\
    \ But when 10 people or 20 people join per day, it's not possible to welcome everyone\
    \ and ask them these questions. Then, in the first quarter, we started events.\
    \ A friend of mine asked me if I know a place where he can give a talk. And I\
    \ said, \u201CYeah, actually, you know what? There is a place where you can do\
    \ that.\u201D"

    \ models with Sage Maker from Dmitri. That was the first event and like, 70 people\
    \ or something like that joined it. I thought, \u201CWow, so cool. I should do\
    \ more of that.\u201D Actually, the second event was like 20, the third event\
    \ was like 10. So I think it was just the excitement of something new and that\
    \ excitement gradually went down. And then, I think around 20 people was the usual\
    \ attendance. So 70 is more like an outlier. This was when I started actively\
    \ announcing that we have events, that we have this awesome community, I was creating\
    \ LinkedIn posts."
  sec: 1110
  time: '18:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Before I was more in stealth mode, but this is where we went live. In the\
    \ first 6 months, we experimented with different activities, like the \u201CBook\
    \ of the Week\u201D where we invite book authors and ask them questions about\
    \ their books. I took this idea from a forum called JavaRanch. They used to do\
    \ something similar and I thought it would be cool to do something like that in\
    \ Data Talks Club as well. Then, we started the podcast. At some point, we even\
    \ had a conference. I think you were also a speaker there at that conference,\
    \ one year ago. Yeah, that attracted quite a few people. I think this is how it\
    \ started. After that conference, I think more than 1000 people joined the community.\
    \ And then gradually, by the end of this year, it reached 9000."

    \ me to share on Data Talks Club. I said \u201COkay, what is DataTalks.Club about?\u201D\
    \ That's when I realized that Alexey was actually putting out two videos, or podcasts,\
    \ a week. That's a lot of work on top of a full time job at OLX. I was wondering\
    \ if you could share with us how you do it. How do you sustain it? Were there\
    \ times that you actually felt like skipping for a week?"
  sec: 1222
  time: '20:22'
  who: Eugene
- line: "Yeah, there were times. What actually helped to not skip was planning in\
    \ advance. I would sit \u2013 like right now, for example \u2013 and plan one\
    \ month in advance. Then I would announce it. Once it's announced, it's very hard\
    \ to skip. People already signed up, they expect me to show up. Then, of course,\
    \ there is a guest who comes. So there is no way to skip after it\u2019s announced.\
    \ I try to do this for a month in advance and that really helps to sustain that."
  sec: 1256

    \ or be a guest at our podcast?\u201D Only maybe half answer and out of this half,\
    \ maybe half say \u2018yes\u2019. So it's not always easy to find speakers. What\
    \ I found helpful is when I ask somebody for a recommendation, I also ask, \u201C\
    Hey, do you know somebody who can speak at our event?\u201D Then, when they reach\
    \ out, I say, \u201CPerson X recommended that I reach out to you and they said\
    \ that you would be interested in speaking. What do you think about doing that?\u201D\

- line: "With webinars, it's easier. Usually, there is not so much preparation on\
    \ my side. Usually the guest, or the speaker, takes the initiative. It's mostly\
    \ on them to prepare. I only need to get the title, the description, biography,\
    \ and a picture. So it's not difficult for me to prepare for that. With podcasts,\
    \ it\u2019s a bit trickier, because I actually need to do some research and put\
    \ it all together. Usually, there is a topic, so first of all, I need to know\
    \ what kind of things I can ask this person. This is why I need to do some research,\
    \ look at the Internet footprint of this person, and see what they usually talk\
    \ about. Or I ask them, \u201CHey, what do you want to talk about?\u201D But when\
    \ I do this, they usually say, \u201COh, I don't know. What do you want to ask\
    \ me?\u201D So I usually need to do some research, and put together a list of\
    \ questions. Then I sent this doc to a guest and then the guest says, \u201COkay,\
    \ yes. I can answer this, this, and this question, but I don't like this question.\
    \ Let's remove that.\u201D We'll do a couple of iterations and once they are comfortable\
    \ with the questions, we make an announcement."

    \ that quite a lot \u2013 doing some research and preparing these questions. After\
    \ that, I announce it on a couple of platforms. So we use Eventbrite, MeetUp.\
    \ I make the announcements there and I use automation tools like Zapier. The moment\
    \ I post something on Eventbrite, it posts a link to Slack, to Twitter, to LinkedIn.\
    \ It really helps me with a lot of routine stuff. So that's helpful and makes\
    \ it a bit easier for me to manage these things. That's another way I sustain\

    \ that I'm doing more in the background. I don't think I ever announced \u201C\
    Hey, we're doing this thing.\u201D Just one day, a video like that appeared. It\
    \ was actually \u2013 you probably know Neil, because you also interviewed him.\
    \ He is doing a model store, which is an open source framework for storing your\
    \ models. I interviewed him once and I liked this format of talking to open source\
    \ authors. Then I reached out to more and more people with that. Even though I\
    \ haven't announced them, these videos are published to our YouTube channel and\
    \ some people watched them. What I want to do there is create a page on our website\
    \ called \u201Ctools\u201D and all these interviews \u2013 all these open source\
    \ tools \u2013 will end up there on Data Talks Club's website. Actually, by the\
    \ way, I am now working on creating a new design for the website and this new\

    \ who are active in the community and ask them about some things for 10-15 minutes.\u201D\
    \ That was the idea of Minis. I reached out to a couple of people, we recorded\

    \ have a webinar, I would release one of these videos to keep the channel active.\
    \ That was only for one month, but I really liked the format. However, given the\

    you're accountable to, people are expecting you to do something and you don't
    want to let people down. Therefore, you deliver.

- line: "Alright. So we have a few more questions. Quinn asks \u201CHow do you learn\
    \ technical subjects? How do you know if you're able to apply it well?\u201D You\
    \ mentioned that you keep notes about your projects. Could you shed some light\
    \ on that?"

  who: Eugene
- line: "I think the best way to learn a technical subject, (especially for a technical\
    \ subject) is to do it through projects. Eugene, I think you mentioned this concept\
    \ a year ago, maybe, \u201Cjust in time learning\u201D. You build a project and\
    \ then there is a thing you need to learn, so you start looking it up. Then you\
    \ solve your problem and you learn just enough to solve this problem \u2013 so\
    \ you don't learn the entirety of machine learning just to solve some classification\
    \ problem. You maybe learn just logistic regression or whatever it is you need.\
    \ That's how I try to learn technical subjects \u2013 by doing projects and by\
    \ focusing on this project. That helps me stay focused on that."

    \ asking for feedback. At work, that could mean deploying things and then doing\
    \ A/B tests \u2013 things like that. But for my personal projects it\u2019s more\
    \ like, \u201CAm I satisfied with the result? Does it work or does it break apart?\u201D\
    \ Things like this. About notes \u2013 when I try something new, I try to document\
    \ everything I do, because I know that the next day I will wake up, and I won\u2019\
    t remember anything about it. Sometimes my bash keeps the history. Sometimes I\
    \ can just go up and see the various comments, but this is very unreliable. Often,\
    \ when I close my terminal, all the comments that I put are gone. I don't know\
    \ why it happens. But I did not rely on that."

    \ \u2013 recently I have been using Notion for that. Then I would just copy/paste\
    \ the comments from the terminal there. Sometimes I would take screenshots with\
    \ errors, and then would post that as well. I shared a couple of tutorials like\
    \ that. I had these documents and then I put them together as docs \u2013 public\
    \ tutorials \u2013 and shared them. I also have a couple of GitHub repos like\
    \ that. So maybe you can check them out."

    \ Slido. So Demetrius, who's a fellow organizer of support communities, I think\

    \ get a few ideas \u2013 I'd say I got inspired \u2013 from the stuff Demetrius\
    \ was doing at the ML Ops community. For example, the format of the podcast we\
    \ have right now and doing it with a live audience. Today, I think this is the\
    \ first time when it didn't really work well, because of the internet problems.\
    \ It\u2019s the first time in more than a year. I hope that it doesn't repeat\
    \ on Friday when we have another one. This idea I \u201Cborrowed\u201D from a\
    \ Demetrious. Then there are some ideas, like for example, from JavaRanch, which\
    \ is a Java community. They invited book authors to ask them questions. I also\
    \ borrowed this idea. So I got a lot of inspiration from other communities and\
    \ perhaps also added a personal twist to these ideas."

    \ the ML Ops community and from people \u2013 from the community members. Sometimes\
    \ people will reach out to me saying, \u201CHey, I have this awesome idea. Do\
    \ you want to try it?\u201D Then usually, I say, \u201CYes, let's try it.\u201D\
    \ There are a few initiatives like that, which unfortunately didn't work out well.\
    \ For example, about networking sessions. But somebody reached out to me saying,\
    \ \u201CHey, it would be nice to just hang out in Zoom. We tried that and it didn't\
    \ work out. But yeah, this is how these things happen."

    \ sessions when it was live coding. So maybe check it out. But this isn\u2019\
    t something that we would regularly do. It will be a good idea to try something\
    \ like this. So yeah, thanks for the idea. But we are already doing a bit of that,\

    \ I'm looking forward to this year to do even more of that. I hope I stay sane\
