transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about the AI Product Manager role. We have a special
    guest today, Geo. Both Geo and I studied on the same program, which was information
    technologies for business intelligence. I did this a few years earlier. After
    graduating, Geo worked as a data scientist, like me. This is also what I did after
    graduating. But after working for a couple of years as a data scientist, Geo switched
    his focus to product management and this is what we will talk about today. Welcome
    Geo.

  who: Geo
- header: "Geo\u2019s background"
- line: Yeah, thanks for coming. Before we go into our main topic of the AI/ML product
    manager role, let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career
    journey so far?
  sec: 104
  time: '1:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, definitely. I think that will help the audience as well. My background\
    \ is mostly computer science engineering, which is what I studied for my Bachelor's.\
    \ I think most of my initial interactions were more Lean, like pure software development\
    \ and web. Even during my studies, I was doing a lot of websites, blogging \u2013\
    \ I was into these kinds of things. At that time, content writing wasn\u2019t\
    \ like blogs, since blogs didn't exist. It was mostly typing content. I was into\
    \ that, so I did WordPress, PHP, baseline optimization, and social media marketing.\
    \ I did that quite a lot, I would say. But it was good. When I think about it\
    \ now, it has actually helped me to understand a lot of key concepts and basics.\
    \ It was also time for me to practice what I was learning as well."
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Geo
- line: "After my graduation, I worked as a developer as well \u2013 Java development\
    \ backend. I did that and then while I was working, this opportunity for BI came\
    \ along. Then I moved to Europe from India and I did a Master's. After finalizing\
    \ my Master's, I worked as a data science engineer. During my Master's, I worked\
    \ with ING Bank for a while, but it was more like a small internship. But I think\
    \ that would be my first formal experience as a product manager. I was working\
    \ very closely with the product management team. After my studies, I went back\
    \ to data science. So I was like, \u201CI think this is what I want to do.\u201D\
    \ That was my impression. But then I slowly realized, \u201CMaybe product management\
    \ is something that I would be more interested in doing.\u201D"
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Geo
- line: "I always like to see the bigger picture of things and adding more value to\
    \ the business. I know that data science also does it, but sometimes it's just\
    \ not visible. I liked all this stuff that product managers were doing, so I slowly\
    \ switched into that direction. Then I moved to the UK and was working as a product\
    \ manager for Revolute for two years. Now I\u2019m at Glovo as a technical product\
    \ manager. That's my career \u2013 nothing very surprising. Normal track of software\
    \ engineer to data science and some of it was continuous data science, but I decided\
    \ to go into product management."
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Geo
- line: "Yeah. That's interesting. You said that you had a bit of product management\
    \ experience as an intern. But then you thought \u201COkay, since I'm doing this\
    \ Master's, I want to do data science.\u201D So you tried a bit of that for a\
    \ couple of years and then you realized that product management was for you, right?"
  sec: 284
  time: '4:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, but I wasn't sure. I knew that I liked product management, but it's\
    \ not an easy job to get into. Product management is not something that is taught\
    \ in any university or anything like that. It's something that you need to learn\
    \ by doing. So it wasn't easy to get into a product management job. I was just\
    \ waiting for the right time and right moment to come along. It was there in my\
    \ mind, \u201COkay, I want to do this.\u201D But I was just not 100% sure."
  sec: 305
  time: '5:05'
  who: Geo
- line: Okay. So the main driver for you was, as you said, that you wanted to see
    the bigger picture, and not just contribute to a specific piece of the system.
    You wanted to have an impact on the overall product. Is that right?
  sec: 339
  time: '5:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I also enjoyed going in and seeing the bigger architectures and how\
    \ these multiple systems interact with each other. As a PM, you can also set the\
    \ direction of where the project is going, which I found quite interesting. I\
    \ know some people like that, while others don't \u2013 they want to focus on\
    \ a smaller scope and keep improving it. That's fair. We need people like that\
    \ as well. I just didn't see myself doing that."
  sec: 354
  time: '5:54'
  who: Geo
- header: Technical Product Manager
- line: Can you tell us more about what Glovo does and what you do there as a technical
    PM?
  sec: 388
  time: '6:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Sure. Glovo is originally from Barcelona and was founded in 2015. Right now\
    \ I'm based in Barcelona as well. It's a super app, but its main focus is on food\
    \ delivery. The mission is very simple \u2013 to give access to anything in the\
    \ city. So it really doesn't matter if it's food, groceries, pharmaceuticals,\
    \ supermarkets \u2013 Glovo is set to deliver everything. The model is the traditional\
    \ flywheel marketplace model. You have different sellers trying to sell their\
    \ stuff, like restaurants, pharmacies \u2013 that's the model. I think almost\
    \ 100 million orders are done every year, on average. The app is currently operating\
    \ in almost 20 plus countries globally."
  sec: 396
  time: '6:36'
  who: Geo
- line: "My job in Glovo is to lead the team that\u2019s managing the machine learning\
    \ platform. Essentially, I'm a technical product manager there and I define the\
    \ vision and direction that this platform should be going. That involves helping\
    \ data scientists deploy different machine learning models. In Glovo, we have\
    \ 50+ data scientists and a lot of data analysts. All of them are using machine\
    \ learning to add value to the business. What my platform is doing is essentially\
    \ helping them by providing the infrastructure to productionize their models faster\
    \ and providing different tools for managing the quality of models, etc. Basically\
    \ the job involves identifying what to do with the platform. \u201CHow can we\
    \ improve the platform?\u201D And \u201CWhat's next? \u201CHow can we improve\
    \ it and align it to make it better?\u201D"
  sec: 396
  time: '6:36'
  who: Geo
- header: Building ML platform
- line: "You said, \u201CLead a team that manages the ML platform.\u201D Does this\
    \ mean that you're building your own platform, or you have some other platform\
    \ that you manage?"
  sec: 510
  time: '8:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: "We are building our own. It's an in-house solution. Essentially, we have\
    \ a legacy platform right now. Maybe legacy is maybe a bit of a harsh term to\
    \ use since it\u2019s just three years old. But the thing is \u2013 industry is\
    \ going so fast and the requirements are super high now. For example, the platform\
    \ we have right now has a training orchestration that was done in Jenkins. But\
    \ we are now slowly moving into Argo and Airflow, so the orchestration is more\
    \ scalable. So these are the kind of things that we do. Slowly, we are improving.\
    \ In the end, it's an in-house platform, though we do integrate third-party tools\
    \ based on the requirements. It's not like we build everything. It depends on\
    \ VSS. If you feel like, \u201CHey, this capability may not be feasible for us\
    \ to build in-house.\u201D What we do is we assess the vendors and say, \u201C\
    Okay, maybe let's use that solution and integrate with the platform.\u201D"
  sec: 521
  time: '8:41'
  who: Geo
- line: Is this something that you do as a technical product manager?
  sec: 584
  time: '9:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Essentially, my role would be to take ongoing feedback from data scientists.\
    \ I discuss it with them \u2013 I may not speak to every data scientist, but I\
    \ usually speak with data science leads or managers of data scientists \u2013\
    \ I take their feedback and see what the problems and challenges are in using\
    \ the platform. That's one way I approach it. The second one is reviewing the\
    \ existing product and seeing what's out there on the market and where the product\
    \ stands. Here, I try to understand, \u201CHey, my platform has these gaps. How\
    \ can we fill them?\u201D This means the product needs more capabilities in the\
    \ platform."
  sec: 590
  time: '9:50'
  who: Geo
- line: So you come in and write the specifications and roadmap and ensure that the
    deliveries come from this. That's another direction. Finally, as always, you have
    the technical depth which may slow things down, but it can also be an accelerator.
    So how does one manage this efficiently and prioritize it? You need to find the
    right balance so that the business is not slowing down. You give the data scientists
    what they want. Some models may need custom tools, so you give them that and prioritize
    what they want. Meanwhile, you also continue improving the platform.
  sec: 590
  time: '9:50'
  who: Geo
- header: Working on internal projects
- line: Interesting. So this is an internal product, meaning that you are not a customer-facing
    team, right? So what is the main idea behind your role? Why does the company have
    a product manager for an internal team?
  sec: 669
  time: '11:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, that's a very good point. Even though it's internal, in the end, there\
    \ are 100+ people using this platform. They are the customers for this platform.\
    \ We need to accelerate the quality of the models \u2013 we need faster time to\
    \ deployment. Therefore, we are actually enabling users of the platform to add\
    \ more value to customers. It's not a direct correlation, but rather an indirect\
    \ one. You are actually enabling everyone in the company to deliver more and more\
    \ value to the customer. That's one way of looking at it."
  sec: 684
  time: '11:24'
  who: Geo
- line: "Secondly, even though it's an internal platform, you still need to understand\
    \ what your customers need as the platform grows. You also need to look into the\
    \ industry and say, \u201CHey, this is what we need to do right now. We need someone\
    \ who can actually prioritize what needs to be done and what capabilities need\
    \ to be in the platform.\u201D So that's how a product manager adds more value\
    \ there. Then, since it's a big platform, you have different requirements coming\
    \ from different stakeholders \u2013 data scientists have different needs, then\
    \ business data engineers may have different needs, apart from that, you also\
    \ have internal requests, \u201CI need these bugs to be fixed.\u201D This requires\
    \ prioritization and understanding."
  sec: 684
  time: '11:24'
  who: Geo
- line: "Based on all the things that need to be done, a product manager assesses\
    \ what can be done and what the best way to do it is. I definitely believe that\
    \ even though it's an internal platform, at some point you need product managers\
    \ to make it efficient and operate it in the right direction. Otherwise, I have\
    \ seen platforms that reach very, very messy states \u2013 they have a lot of\
    \ tools, a lot of capabilities, and no one knows how to use them and there is\
    \ no direction to it all."
  sec: 684
  time: '11:24'
  who: Geo
- line: "So that's what happens when an internal team \u2013 a tooling team or a platform\
    \ team \u2013 doesn't have a product manager, right?"
  sec: 817
  time: '13:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Usually what happens is that developers may say, \u201CHey, this tool\
    \ is cool. Let's integrate it.\u201D They integrate it. In the end, you will have\
    \ a platform that has a bunch of tools or libraries, or even multiple UIs. A person\
    \ comes in to use it and they\u2019re like, \u201CHey\u2026 Where should I even\
    \ start?\u201D Even though there is documentation, they will say \u201CHey, there\
    \ is this tool for tracking. What about this tool?\u201D There is a lack of consistency\
    \ and a lack of UI. So in the end, what happens is \u2013 if you think about it,\
    \ a data scientist\u2019s salary is maybe 4000 euros on average \u2013 if the\
    \ person is struggling to use this platform for two weeks, you're actually costing\
    \ the business money. Let's take an example. Say two weeks is around 2,000 euros\
    \ and there are 50 users there. You're actually losing around 100,000 euros. If\
    \ you think about it like that, then you will see why you need some product managers\
    \ to fix this."
  sec: 824
  time: '13:44'
  who: Geo
- header: Prioritizing the backlog
- line: "How do you help to actually do this? You said you prioritize things, collect\
    \ requirements, and the requirements come from different sources. So this can\
    \ be something like \u2013 you saw a demo from some external tool or somebody\
    \ complained to you about something. You take all this down and put it in a backlog,\
    \ and then you prioritize the backlog. How do you do that?"
  sec: 895
  time: '14:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: The prioritization process is done with the development team. We have engineering
    managers and usually, the product managers work very closely with engineering
    managers and the development team itself. The product managers try to define what
    the problem is, while the definition of the solution happens with the engineering
    team. All these discussions are part of our weekly grooming of the backlog. The
    product manager runs the sessions. For example, every week, we have an hour where
    we discuss the top priorities.
  sec: 919
  time: '15:19'
  who: Geo
- line: "Then we decide together with the team by following some Agile methodologies\
    \ or something like that to make sure we have deliveries. Once we agree on the\
    \ backlog and time of delivery, we communicate back to the stakeholders, \u201C\
    Hey, data scientists requested this feature.\u201D I will go back to the data\
    \ scientists saying \u201CWe are actually working on this and you can expect this\
    \ to be delivered in two weeks or four weeks or a month.\u201D"
  sec: 919
  time: '15:19'
  who: Geo
- header: Defining the problems
- line: "Interesting. You mentioned one important thing \u2013 that your job as a\
    \ product manager is to think about problems. So you define a problem? But then,\
    \ you're not thinking about the solution, the engineering team thinks about the\
    \ solution. Is that right?"
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Well, it's actually quite a complex topic to discuss. The danger is that\
    \ often, people don't really understand the problem first, and they go directly\
    \ into solutions instead. That's very dangerous, in my opinion. I have seen examples\
    \ where people said to me, \u201CHey, I want to solve recommendations and multi-category\
    \ recommendations will work. I read an article in Medium about it.\u201D You can\
    \ draw conclusions right away and say \u201CThis solution may work.\u201D But\
    \ it is also important that you validate your hypothesis, etc. As a product manager,\
    \ I say what the desired outcome would be, but not the solution."
  sec: 1004
  time: '16:44'
  who: Geo
- line: Let's say I want the model training time to be reduced by X percent. Now the
    outcome is clear and the metric is clear. While the engineering team I work with
    will have to go back and forth. Now that the problem is clear and the outcome
    is clear, we just need to find how we reach that stage. It's always important
    that you define your problem clearly and decide what the outcome should be. The
    outcome is essentially how you will measure it. I think it's easy to say, but
    I spend a lot of time doing this.
  sec: 1004
  time: '16:44'
  who: Geo
- header: Observability metrics
- line: "So, you mean KPIs and things like that, right? How can you measure that your\
    \ platform is good? How do you measure it \u2013 if you reduce the time that a\
    \ data scientist spent with your platform? It's very hard to track, right?"
  sec: 1092
  time: '18:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: These things are hard to track, so you have to build observability metrics.
    You need to push more metrics to maybe Datadog or whatever observability tools
    you're using. I would say this is an interesting topic that even industry is hard-pressed
    to answer sometimes. Because I think many of the ML Ops tools in the market don't
    have this answer yet. It's a problem I think everyone is trying to solve.
  sec: 1105
  time: '18:25'
  who: Geo
- header: "Avoiding jumping into \u201Csolution mode\u201D"
- line: "Yeah. The question I actually had when asking that is \u2013 I know that\
    \ you have an engineering background. You spent some time doing Java development\
    \ and you spent some time doing data science. Maybe not now, but some time ago,\
    \ you were quite hands-on. You still know how to do some things \u2013 you still\
    \ remember and have this experience. So how do you make sure you don't jump into\
    \ \u2018solution mode\u2019 and that you don't start recommending teams what to\
    \ do as a PM?"
  sec: 1136
  time: '18:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. That's actually a very good question. It's also one of the hardest\
    \ things that you struggle with on a daily basis as a PM. I think it's the mindset\
    \ of a PM where you need to actually think more about the problem itself. Sure,\
    \ I think I want to jump into solutions, but mistakes are usually made because\
    \ you can sometimes get too excited about a problem. But it's not like, \u201C\
    Stop being excited.\u201D It's just about spending more time on understanding\
    \ the problem itself and breaking it down into small pieces. That's one exercise\
    \ that helps prevent me from going directly into solutions."
  sec: 1169
  time: '19:29'
  who: Geo
- line: "When you start breaking down your problem into smaller pieces and figure\
    \ out how to solve it, you essentially understand that, \u201CI cannot think about\
    \ one solution directly. It's not the right way and right time for me to do it.\
    \ I should try to spend some time clarifying this problem and breaking it down\
    \ into small pieces.\u201D That's one way of doing it. The other one is that it\
    \ just takes practice and consistent effort. Sometimes you do that as well. Then\
    \ you will have to be realistic about it and say, \u201CI did this and I need\
    \ to make sure that I'm not doing it anymore.\u201D"
  sec: 1169
  time: '19:29'
  who: Geo
- header: Breaking down the problem
- line: Yeah. Interesting. You said you spend a lot of time trying to understand the
    problem and break it down. Do you do this alone or the whole team is involved?
    What does the process usually look like?
  sec: 1255
  time: '20:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, sometimes. The whole team is involved In some of the cases. It\u2019\
    s mostly with the actual users, which can depend on the job I do. In the previous\
    \ job, it was sometimes with regulators or compliance managers and some customers.\
    \ Right now, I mostly spend time with data scientists and take their feedback,\
    \ do some brainstorming sessions. It may be just a small session where we do an\
    \ exercise together and say, \u201CLet's go deeper.\u201D We list out all the\
    \ problems and group the problems together. Usually, this involves workshops or\
    \ customer interviews, or user interviews and things like that. This helps us\
    \ to better clarify the problem. For the most part, I would say that we talk \u2013\
    \ communicate and understand each other. That's the way it usually works."

- header: Important skills for product managers
- line: Would you say speaking, communicating, and prioritization are the main skills
    you need to have as a product manager?
  sec: 1325
  time: '22:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Ideally, yes. I think those are the key drivers. As a product manager, most\
    \ of your schedule is built around communication, so you spend a lot of time in\
    \ discussions with people. Good communication is a very important skill to have.\
    \ I also don't believe that everyone has this skill from day one. It takes time\
    \ and practice. Prioritization is a key skill as well, which I would say is also\
    \ not an easy thing to master. I know people with 10 or 20 years of product management\
    \ experience and they still spend a lot of time developing this skill because\
    \ it's not easy at all. You have many people with many requirements and all of\
    \ them are important. So your job is to go back and be realistic in prioritizing\
    \ things \u2013 What needs to be done? What brings value to customers?"
  sec: 1335
  time: '22:15'
  who: Geo
- line: What other kinds of skills do you think you need at work, in addition to communication
    and prioritization?
  sec: 1399
  time: '23:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: "In my specific case, since I\u2019m closer to the ML world, I would say it's\
    \ also important to understand the market or where the industry is going with\
    \ machine learning. This includes machine learning ops and engineering practices,\
    \ cloud technologies, etc. You need to be constantly updated, because you may\
    \ be solving the problem in a really wrong way or maybe you're not using the right\
    \ tools. To avoid this, you need to be constantly learning about what's happening\
    \ in the industry. Maybe this could be a review of some materials or participating\
    \ in some events. Learning is very important, I would say."
  sec: 1408
  time: '23:28'
  who: Geo
- line: Secondly, I think you need to have an understanding of model architectures
    and other technical things, like building event streaming systems or Bats or Big
    Data-related knowledge and database-related knowledge. All this can help because,
    in the end, your communication is based on these topics. If you cannot understand
    or you cannot stay updated with it, you are going to struggle a lot as a product
    manager. You need to be really updated with what the technologies are in the company
    and how people are using them.
  sec: 1408
  time: '23:28'
  who: Geo
- line: "There could be security-related issues from not knowing these things or it\
    \ can be a wide range of other issues, so you need to have a good understanding\
    \ of how it works. Otherwise it can turn into a bit of a disaster \u2013 being\
    \ a product manager who communicates a lot but doesn't understand what's happening\
    \ under the hood. For that, learning is quite important, I would say."
  sec: 1408
  time: '23:28'
  who: Geo
- header: The importance of a technical background
- line: "How important do you think it is to have a technical background for a technical\
    \ product manager? I\u2019m guessing you studied all the things you mentioned\
    \ and you probably also know them from your work."
  sec: 1516
  time: '25:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: "We have different kinds of product managers and we can go into that later.\
    \ But in my kind of role, I would say it's very important. If you're communicating\
    \ with data scientists often, you need to understand things like the lifecycle\
    \ of the model and how the model works. You need to have an understanding of algorithms,\
    \ etc. So that's very important. On the other hand, you're also going back and\
    \ talking to your team \u2013 which is essentially engineers who are building\
    \ a platform \u2013 so you need to understand different cloud technologies, tooling,\

    right now? Or engineers? Can they become machine learning product managers?

  who: Alexey
- line: "It's easier for them to become a traditional software engineering PMs, I\
    \ would say. Because in this role, you go into writing specifications, understanding\
    \ the requirements, etc.. If they have some understanding of machine learning\
    \ philosophy, yes \u2013 it will work. But a 100% immediate transition may not\
    \ be that easy. However, I would never say a hard \u2018no\u2019 to it. I think\
    \ some people are very good at learning. So if they can learn the philosophies\
    \ and understand how an AI project is structured, I think they can do it as well.\
    \ In the end, most of the things I mentioned, or the things I do as an AI product\
    \ manager \u2013 I think 80% is the same as normal product management. It's just\
    \ that 20%, where I add more value with my background."

    \ a bit more about AI product management. This shouldn't be stopping you from\
    \ applying into ML product management jobs. That's just my personal take. It also\
    \ depends on companies. Some companies are like, \u201CI want someone like this,\
    \ this, this.\u201D And some of them are more flexible. Therefore, you need to\
    \ find people who are going to trust you and give you that kind of opportunity\

    guess when you read the job description, you never know whether the people on

    to find out is just to apply and see what happens, right?
  sec: 3255

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Definitely. I think that's the philosophy. Also, when I was applying
    to Revolute, I really liked the product and was using it for two years. So when
    they spoke with me, I knew a lot about the product and they knew that I had a
    clear passion to do something to help their business. This was helpful for me
    to join them as a Product Manager. I think sometimes, if you can clearly showcase
    your passion and your interest in this domain, I think it is possible to crack
    into it.

  sec: 3339

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. User research, in my case, I'm assuming is more the data scientists
    and how they're using the platform. Right now, what I do is speak with data scientists
    and data science leads on a monthly basis. We have follow up sessions with them
    about feedback. We frequently do surveys, like once every two months, about feedback
    and which capabilities are being used. Then we produce something called a Happiness
    Report for the internal platform. Let's say, for this platform, our customers
    like the features and they are using them.

    \ we got. How can we work on it?\u201D So when I prioritize my objectives or key\
    \ results for the next quarter, or even for a sprint, I try to address some of\
    \ these challenges in an ongoing way. It's also an objective of mine as a product\
    \ manager, to increase the usability of the platform. To do this, we constantly\
    \ speak to the customers to understand what the users need. Then we translate\
    \ that into our objectives and use some initiatives to keep it up."

    \ if I understand the question correctly. In Revolute, the expectation is that\
    \ the engineers, data scientists, and MLEs should do the QA of their own code.\
    \ As a product manager, I had a checklist for each release, especially if my product\
    \ was a governance product. There were five different benchmarks to be passed\
    \ for a model to go into production. Let's say there is a new version of your\
    \ model \u2013 we first tested it using historical data for maybe six months to\
    \ see how the model performs. Then we took some publicly available industry benchmarks\
    \ for the same use case and we validated it using that. Then we also had a labeled\
    \ \u2018gold\u2019 dataset as well. After that, we shadowed it in the production\
    \ with actual live traffic and looked at the results from that."

    \ and I worked with. Every model and every version of a model we created, we tested\
    \ it in this manner and slowly rolled it out this way. That was the quality control\
    \ that we did at my last job. Here, in the platform team, it\u2019s usually the\
    \ engineers themselves that check QA. They write their own tests and we try to\
    \ make sure that we have good test coverage and everything. So, in the end, I\
    \ don't think everything is perfect, since people always have bugs. If you don't\
    \ have bugs, I don't think you're doing your job correctly. [laughs]"

- line: "There is another question also from Eva. Thanks Eva for asking questions.\
    \ \u201CDo you have any tips for somebody who is working as a scrum master right\
    \ now (someone who is totally new to machine learning) and they need to support\
    \ a machine learning team. Do you have any advice for this kind of person? What\
    \ can they do to support the teams better?\u201D"
  sec: 3562
  time: '59:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I am not sure I understood the question correctly. Usually, a scrum master,
    if I understand the role, is mostly about running Agile practices. This is something
    I also do sometimes as a product manager. If the question refers to extending
    the scope of this role, you just need to take more time in the problem definition
    part and work with the product manager to define the problem properly. As a Scrum
    master, you are likely already quite experienced in delivering the product. You
    know how to prioritize your backlog, which is a great asset for any good PM.
  sec: 3592
  time: '59:52'
  who: Geo
- line: "Even though Agile philosophies are not directly mentioned in PM interviews,\
    \ most companies value having a good Agile background quite a lot. How to prioritize\
    \ your backlog, how to deliver a roadmap \u2013 all of this is very important.\
    \ I also think the extension involves thinking about how to create a roadmap rather\
    \ than someone creating it for you. Again, you need to work with your PM to say,\
    \ \u201CHey, maybe for this project, I can create a roadmap. And I can deliver\
    \ it.\u201D So I don't think the transition is super hard, because I have seen\
    \ a lot of Scrum masters coming into product management. A lot of business analysts\
    \ come into product management as well."

    \ You should always think about how to get out of your comfort zone on a frequent\
