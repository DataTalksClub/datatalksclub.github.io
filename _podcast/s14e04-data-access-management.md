short: Data Access Management
title: Data Access Management
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about data access management. We have a special guest
    today, Bart. Bart is the CEO and co-founder of Raito. Bart is on a mission to
    give data workers access to the data they need, to do their job in a faster and
    safer way. Before co-founding Raito, Bart worked as a senior product manager in
    the data privacy area at Collibra, and Bart believes that for data to be liquid,
    trust has to be solid. He will probably tell us later what it means for data to
    be liquid. [Bart agrees] Because I have no idea. [chuckles] My imagination is
    not good enough to understand this metaphor. So welcome to our show.
  sec: 87
  time: '1:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hey, Alexey, thanks for having me. Super excited to be on the show today.
  sec: 129
  time: '2:09'
  who: Bart
- line: As always, the questions you will hear today were prepared by Johanna Bayer.
    Thanks a lot, Johanna, for your help.
  sec: 134
  time: '2:14'
  who: Alexey
- header: Bart's background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of data access management, let's start with
    your background. Can you tell us about your career journeys so far?
  sec: 143
  time: '2:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, Alexey. That was a really great summary before starting. I was, indeed,
    a product manager of privacy at Collibra. That's where we also saw the challenge
    of scalable data access methods. Now, Collibra was my first step in the world
    of data and software. Before that, I was actually a consultant at Deloitte, where
    I was doing financial risk management. But there, I saw that the future is data
    – that everything revolves around data. That's why I made the move to Collibra.
    But I learned that for data to be really successful, and for organizations to
    be really successful, they need to have that trust. And that's why I started Raito
    together with Deiter, my co-founder.
  sec: 153
  time: '2:33'
  who: Bart
- line: So what did you do as a consultant at Deloitte?
  sec: 206
  time: '3:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: We helped banks with accounting, with valuation of financial products – there
    was a lot of mathematics, a lot of physics, some models that we borrowed from
    physics. But then, gradually, I was also getting more and more involved in data
    governance programs because this was right after the financial crisis. That was
    where, for banks, it was impossible to know how much loans were defaulted, and
    what their exposure was to other banks. Then the European regulator actually boasts
    data governance regulation on banks to improve data quality, literature, and so
    forth. In that way, I kind of evolved into the data governance space.
  sec: 211
  time: '3:31'
  who: Bart
- line: Basically, there was a financial crisis and banks had some data, but it was
    a huge mess. And what you did as a part of your job as a consultant at Deloitte
    was help them make it less messy. Right?
  sec: 260
  time: '4:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Indeed. I mean, talk about trauma, right? This is before you had all the hip
    data governance solutions that are out there now. If you have to do data governance
    now, it's much more pleasant than when I had to do it. I had to draw and manage
    it in something like the MS Office tool. I had to keep data dictionaries in Excel.
    So this was before all the tooling was there. And I can tell you, it was not great.
    By the time my lineage was ready, it was already outdated. By the time my dictionary
    was ready, it was already outdated. And I had to go back.
  sec: 280
  time: '4:40'
  who: Bart
- header: What is data governance?
- line: So what is data governance, actually?
  sec: 320
  time: '5:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Data governance is... each time the term “data governance” is mentioned, you
    see people frantically looking for the nearest exit to escape the conversation.
    It's a heavy-loaded term. If I would have to summarize data governance, it's just
    all the activities that you do to create trust in the data that you're using.
    It's that your data workers – your data analysts and scientists – can trust that
    they're using the right data. It's that they can trust that the data has sufficient
    data quality. But it's also just that your customers can trust that their data
    is being used in a safe way.
  sec: 324
  time: '5:24'
  who: Bart
- line: If you put it in that perspective, who doesn't want data governance, right?
    So despite the bad connotation that data governance has, if you're really serious
    about using data as a competitive asset, you need to create trust, and hence,
    you need to do some of those activities. But the cool thing is that the perception
    is shifting. You have all these cool startups now (among others) that help you
    do data access or data governance in a more scalable way.
  sec: 324
  time: '5:24'
  who: Bart
- line: Why does it actually have a bad connotation? Why do people search for the
    fire exit when you talk about it? [chuckles]
  sec: 403
  time: '6:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's because of how we used to do data governance. It used to be very centralized,
    right? A bit like in an ivory tower...
  sec: 412
  time: '6:52'
  who: Bart
- line: Like those Excel sheets that you talk about?[chuckles]
  sec: 422
  time: '7:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Excel sheets, yeah. So it's a couple of things. It's awareness. It was very
    hard, and it's still today, very difficult to make people aware in the organization
    about the importance of good data governance. But there's also the way that we
    used to do data governance. It used to be in an ivory tower. Your boss issued
    standards that he tried to impose on the organization, and it was always bolted
    on data products, bolted on how we use data. That creates a lot of friction, right?
    It makes it that a data governance team is more policing.
  sec: 424
  time: '7:04'
  who: Bart
- line: But why does that happen? Is it because somebody from... For example, in your
    case, when you worked at Deloitte, the EU commission or some governmental entity
    said, “Okay, you have a mess, banks. Go fix it.” And then top management in a
    bank probably thought (or just told others), “Hey, we have a mess in the data.
    Go fix it.” So this was a top-down decision and it was forced on people. Plus
    it was too difficult to implement. Right? Is that why it has this bad connotation?
  sec: 460
  time: '7:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, indeed. We're learning. Data governance is going through a transition.
    How it used to be was, indeed, top-down and forced on the organization. People
    had to do it and they didn't want to do it. But what's happening now is, it's
    becoming more and more grassroots (bottom-up) where data governance is being implemented
    – in the DataOps process. Data engineers can integrate in the development process,
    making it so much easier and it becomes more convenient. Also, they really see
    the value from it. So in that perspective, it's really evolving in a good way.
  sec: 496
  time: '8:16'
  who: Bart
- header: Data dictionaries and data lineage
- line: So you mentioned a few things. You mentioned a thing called data lineage,
    where you use Office tools to draw. Then you mentioned that the data dictionary
    was in Excel. But what actually are these things, and why did banks care about
    them? Why was it important for them to actually have these things? Why did they
    care about that? How did it help solve their problems?
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't think they really cared back then. This was 2009-10. It was basically
    the BCBS 239 regulation that kind of imposed a better process (better data governance)
    on banks. They had to comply. That's why it was top-down, because you had to do
    it. Nowadays, people are more and more becoming aware that you have to do it if
    you really want to use data. That's a bit of the mind shift that's happening today.
  sec: 564
  time: '9:24'
  who: Bart
- line: And this lineage and data dictionary – what are they?
  sec: 602
  time: '10:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: The dictionary, or the catalog... let me start by establishing what a catalog
    is. A catalog is just a list of all your datasets that you have in your organization.
    You just read the description to see what you can find in a dataset, and also
    just the definition. For example, “customer” has a different interpretation depending
    on where you are in the business, right? In finance, a customer is somebody that's
    paying the bills (the invoices) whereas in sales, a customer is somebody that
    is becoming a customer. Different definitions. You have to be sure what the definition
    is if you look at the report. And lineage is a traceability view, or a view of
    how your data flows through your application and data sources.
  sec: 607
  time: '10:07'
  who: Bart
- line: So it's like “Okay, this data starts here, then there is this transformation
    applied to this data, and this transformation. And this is how it ends in a report
    for the top management.” So you can kind of see the entire journey of the data.
  sec: 660
  time: '11:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That's correct.
  sec: 677
  time: '11:17'
  who: Bart
- header: Data access management
- line: Okay. And what does it have to do with data access management? What is data
    access management?
  sec: 680
  time: '11:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Well, data access management is a weird conundrum. It's security – data
    access management is really like a form of access management. It's security. But
    how it has historically grown is that it's now a responsibility of the data governance
    teams  – of the data teams. In this way, it's a bit weird. [chuckles] But to understand
    data access management, you've got to take a step back. Access management used
    to be... we used to manage access at the application or database level, You had
    access or you did not. But once you had access, you had access to all the data
    in there.
  sec: 687
  time: '11:27'
  who: Bart
- line: 'But now, cloud computing and cloud storage have completely revolutionized
    the way that we use data. What you see is that data teams are now massively building
    analytical workflows or data science workflows on a public cloud. By doing that,
    they''re taking data from all these different systems and applications and moving
    it to one location: your lake, your warehouse. And by doing that, they lose the
    Chinese walls that they naturally had between the different source systems.'
  sec: 687
  time: '11:27'
  who: Bart
- line: Now, we have all data in one location, and it is being publicly accessed over
    the web, of course, you need to have the same Chinese walls in your lakes and
    the warehouses. You've seen all the data breaches – you look at LinkedIn or a
    newspaper, and there are data breaches in there. There's all the privacy regulations.
    Your customer awareness is increasing. So you need to have these same Chinese
    walls in your warehouse and in your lake. That means managing access at the dataset
    level and that's data access management.
  sec: 687
  time: '11:27'
  who: Bart
- line: Okay. You mentioned that data access management is the responsibility of the
    data governance team. So what actually is a data governance team? What do they
    do?
  sec: 803
  time: '13:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, it kind of depends, right? What we see is that in organizations that
    are really data-driven of up to 3000 people, their data access management is still
    the responsibility of the data team – the data engineers. Then for larger organizations,
    you'll see that they start building out a data governance team who will be responsible
    for the data access management. Or in certain cases, when they're implementing
    data mesh, then it's the data owners who are responsible for data access management.
  sec: 814
  time: '13:34'
  who: Bart
- line: As for a data governance team, the nature of that team is kind of shifting.
    It used to be dictionaries, definitions, the lineage, the catalog, and so forth,
    but now it's also becoming more and more of a team that promotes data usage (does
    evangelization) and enables teams to use data in a more efficient way. So it's
    going more from monitoring and policing to enabling the business.
  sec: 814
  time: '13:34'
  who: Bart
- header: How to learn about data governance
- line: So in smaller organizations of up to 3000 people... very small organizations,
    right? [chuckles] In these organizations, there is a team (I guess a central team)
    of data engineers that moves data from one place to another. As a part of that,
    they implement some of the things we discussed. Right? So it's just data engineers
    who do that. But how much...? I'm thinking of data engineers whose core skills
    are cloud, building all these ETLs, Spark, Python, Docker – all this stuff.  Very
    technical people.
  sec: 887
  time: '14:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: How do they actually know about what they need to do? Do they need to educate
    themselves in data governance and data access management? Because it doesn't seem
    like their core job. Maybe it should be, but it's not – at least from what I typically
    see data engineers doing.
  sec: 887
  time: '14:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: What you've just described is a core problem. Look, if you're a data engineer
    who is interested in data governance, please investigate. Please learn more. It's
    only going to improve your career. But it's not your core competence, right? You
    haven't studied, or you haven't delved into data engineering to do data governance.
    That's a bit of that challenge that we're seeing, specifically for data access
    management as we're talking to a lot of organizations. The data engineers have
    to do it, because that's how it was – they get access requests, so have to manage
    access. And they have to do it because they know the technology. That's the only
    reason.
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Bart
- line: They're not doing it because they know the business context or they know the
    policies. No. It's because they know the technology and they're using it. So they
    end up being the people who have to process the access requests and that's not
    how it should be. Right? It's not their core competency. It's not what they were
    hired for. They should be focusing on other things, like managing infrastructure.
    And that's why you see that somewhat larger organizations, indeed have realized
    that, “Hey, this shouldn't be with the data team. Let's give it to the data owners
    or the data governance team.”
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Bart
- line: So in larger, or maybe more mature organizations, there is the central data
    team with data engineers. But in addition to that, there is this data governance
    team. Correct?
  sec: 1019
  time: '16:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Or a data mesh team, where the responsibility is with the data owners.
  sec: 1029
  time: '17:09'
  who: Bart
- header: What skills are needed to do data governance effectively
- line: And what kind of skills should these people in the data governance team have
    in order to be able to do these things effectively? Where do you actually learn
    these things?
  sec: 1038
  time: '17:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Concerning the skills, I'll ignore the data owner for the moment. In the data
    governance team, I actually think the biggest skill is... you don't need to know
    all the technology. You don't have to be super technical. You need some kind of
    business affinity. But you also need to be able to enable and manage change. To
    be successful, people have to change, processes have to change, etc.
  sec: 1050
  time: '17:30'
  who: Bart
- line: 'You need to be a change enabler. That''s probably the biggest skill they
    can have working in data governance – “How can I change behavior? How can I make
    people aware? How can I evangelize? In terms of hard skills (pure knowledge),
    there''s the DMBOK (DAMA-DMBOK: Data Management Body of Knowledge). It''s really
    like the Bible for data governance people.'
  sec: 1050
  time: '17:30'
  who: Bart
- line: Okay. You said the skills that they need is change management, which does
    not sound like something that engineering or computer science courses cover at
    any university I know. I guess these people do not necessarily come from a computer
    science background. So what kind of background is actually best? Where do they
    usually come from? Like you, from the consultancy space, or where?
  sec: 1113
  time: '18:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I've seen data governance people with all kinds of backgrounds, actually –
    engineering, legal, HR, marketing...
  sec: 1147
  time: '19:07'
  who: Bart
- line: So it's not something you can learn in school. For instance, when you finish
    school, you can't say, “Oh! Let's go learn about data governance!” and have a
    Bachelor's degree in that.
  sec: 1159
  time: '19:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not that I'm aware of, but I wouldn't be surprised if that comes about soon.
    [cross-talk]
  sec: 1171
  time: '19:31'
  who: Bart
- line: I guess it would be a specialization in some sort of other field. Right?
  sec: 1178
  time: '19:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I mean, like I said, it's really fundamental. I was at Coalesce in London
    last year (a DBT conference). This is about analytics engineering. There were
    the keynotes. And after the keynotes, I was with the co-founders and the product
    manager of DBT. There was a Q&A, and half of the Q&A were data governance questions
    – they were data governance-related. These were analytics engineers, they were
    building on DBT. And because they were focused on proving the value of data –
    getting these initial data products out, those initial successes. Then they had
    success – they got more and more data consumers on the platform, and more and
    more data products in there. Then you start seeing all those data governance issues.
    And data access management is really one of those challenges.
  sec: 1188
  time: '19:48'
  who: Bart
- line: That's why you see that the data teams that have proven the value of data,
    they're getting more data consumers on the platform, they're successful in their
    self-service analytics, the number of data products is exploding. And then they're
    getting all these data access management issues. It's the same with data governance
    – it applies to data access management. Now you've got to gradually mature your
    data access management, right? You cannot just say, “Oh, stop the presses. Hold
    on, everybody. Stop doing self-service analytics. I've gotta improve my data access
    management.” That doesn't work. That's too disruptive. That's also the approach
    for data access management. It should be done incrementally. Don't have a big
    bang, but incrementally improve your data access maturity. It's the same with
    data governance. That's where you need a good plan, a good change agent, that
    allows you to do that.
  sec: 1188
  time: '19:48'
  who: Bart
- line: I understand. What about those poor data engineers working in smaller organizations
    who, all of a sudden, need to deal with all these data access requests? I assume
    some of them might naturally become interested in data governance. So how do they
    actually get better at that? Do they pick up the book you mentioned (DMBOK)? Or
    how do they do this?
  sec: 1310
  time: '21:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: There's a lot of content out there. There are also several Slack communities.
    There's a data mesh Slack community. The name escapes me, but there's also a data
    governance Slack community where you can go and check out. So there are definitely
    communities and literature out there that can help you.
  sec: 1334
  time: '22:14'
  who: Bart
- line: I think there is a book from O'Reilly that is called Data Governance, right?
    [Bart hesitatingly agrees] I think we had the authors on this podcast a couple
    of years ago. So if anyone is listening and did not check that out, maybe you
    can go and watch that. Just type “data governance” into our YouTube channel. We
    discussed it in much more detail.
  sec: 1357
  time: '22:37'
  who: Alexey
- header: When an organization needs to start thinking about data governance
- line: So when is an organization large enough to actually start thinking about the
    data governance team? Or is it more a question of maturity? How does it happen?
  sec: 1383
  time: '23:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it depends on several factors. What I see in practice is that this
    is for organizations that are very serious about data. They have customer data,
    and they want to use it as competitive assets – for better insights, better services,
    better products, and so forth. Then you have to really have the basis of data
    governance to become successful at that. Now, this is typically when the organization
    is of a certain size. If you're small and can just talk to each other over the
    computer screen or over Slack, as we're working from home now – but as of a certain
    size, if you're serious about data, then you really need to invest somewhat in
    data governance. Because, as I said, it is the fundamentals to become successful
    with data.
  sec: 1394
  time: '23:14'
  who: Bart
- line: Let's say, a startup with 10 people – do they need a data governance thing?
  sec: 1456
  time: '24:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I don't think at that stage you need data governance. You all have the
    same definition of the data, you understand the data flows. For data access management,
    just one person manages it. It's when you start getting more data consumers on
    the platform, when you start getting more data products in there, and you start
    feeling like the issues are piling up, such as people not trusting the reports
    anymore, data quality issues. You see the trust disappearing – the trust fading.
    You get a lot of ad hoc requests, put out a lot of fires. These are all symptoms
    of a lack of data governance.
  sec: 1463
  time: '24:23'
  who: Bart
- line: Let's say if we have data issues, and we already lost the trust in data, isn't
    it too late now to do this? Should we have tried to prevent it?
  sec: 1505
  time: '25:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, indeed. The priority is often, “Let's prove the value of data first,”
    In theory, yeah, it should have been prevented. In practice, if you have a limited
    budget and your responsibility is to prove that there's value in data analytics,
    you're gonna focus on that. And when that takes off, you're going to improve your
    data governance. That's how it happens in practice, I would love to see it the
    other way around. But that's how it is.
  sec: 1517
  time: '25:17'
  who: Bart
- line: '[chuckles] So I guess for a startup with 10 people, it''s like two teams
    working together at most. But let''s say that there is one team that is producing
    data, and then there are multiple teams that are consuming this data, the moment
    you have some sensitive data that only one team can consume and others cannot,
    such as some personal identifiable data, then you need to start thinking, “Okay,
    how do we make sure that this team can have access to this data and this team
    cannot?” Then you need to start thinking, “How do we keep this organized? How
    do we not go mad thinking about all these things?” Because there could be another
    field and other sensitive kinds of information that maybe just one team wanting
    can consume, and it''s a different team. Right?'
  sec: 1544
  time: '25:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. I think you need access management before you create a data governance
    team, that's for sure. As soon as you have a data warehouse or a lake, and you
    have sensitive data in there – be it customer data, or business-critical data,
    like very sensitive intellectual property – of course, there you need data access
    management. That's for sure. And then, like you said, if you start bringing on
    more data consumers, then you really need it. But then you need to do it in a
    scalable way. You need to have automated processes, better insights, better collaboration.
  sec: 1593
  time: '26:33'
  who: Bart
- line: That's when you have to start looking at taking that responsibility and the
    processes out of the core data team, and then put it either with the governance
    team that typically starts developing around that size – you start getting your
    first data steward (data governance person) or push it to the data owners. But
    if anything, when you work with customer data, data access management is one of
    the parts of data governance that you have to start with as early as possible.
  sec: 1593
  time: '26:33'
  who: Bart
- header: Good data access management processes
- line: You mentioned the word “process” many, many times. I'm wondering, what should
    a good enough process look like if we talk about data access management? Let's
    say we have producers of data, we have consumers of data, some of the data is
    sensitive, so not everyone should have access to that, and one team wants to have
    access to this data. How do they go about starting to consume this data?

- line: Three or four times. Yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 1705
  time: '28:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Well, there are many processes in data access management. You have the
    access request, approval, you have the regular reviews, you have revoking access,
    and so forth. I think it starts with good roles and responsibilities. Ideally,
    and this is for somewhat larger organizations, you need a good collaboration between
    the data owners who know the business context of the data – who know what it means.
    Ideally, they approve access, they manage access, and they review it. The data
    owners work with the data engineers – they know the technology. They have to implement
    the controls.
  sec: 1708
  time: '28:28'
  who: Bart
- line: And then, if you have a data governance team, they should also be involved
    because they know the regulatory context within your work. They know the privacy
    and security standards, and the policies in the organization. Ideally, you have
    a collaboration between these three. What we've seen is that when data access
    management does not scale, it's because the collaboration between these three
    elements has broken.
  sec: 1708
  time: '28:28'
  who: Bart
- line: I'm thinking that it's still a bit abstract to me. Let's take an example.
    For example, we have a use case like churn prediction. We're in a company, we
    have some clients – it could be something like your usual internet SaaS company.
    There is a customer team that manages all the information about the customers
    like their contact details and so on. And let's say there is also a marketing
    team that wants to understand if somebody is about to churn. If so, we want to
    try to win them back by offering some discounts. So the marketing team wants to
    implement this churn prediction. The marketing team needs access to the email
    field. How do they go about this if we have proper data governance and data access
    management tools? You mentioned that there are things like access request/approval/revocation.
    People probably ask the requests, right? How does it happen?
  sec: 1776
  time: '29:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Ideally, there's this concept of shifting governance left. Ideally, when the
    data engineers have created the initial dataset with the customer emails, they
    have decked that dataset with customer email, and they've also defined the roles
    that can access that dataset.
  sec: 1840
  time: '30:40'
  who: Bart
- line: So that's the customer team, right? The data engineers in the team that make
    this data available, it's their responsibility to document this data and say which
    of the fields (which information) is sensitive, which is not, and who can access
    what. Right?
  sec: 1867
  time: '31:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, ideally. And that's when you start moving towards data mesh and data
    contracts. The data producers in a sales team say, “This dataset contains customer
    data, These are the roles that can assume it.” And then the marketing team basically,
    when they need that dataset, they find it in a catalog, and they say, “Hey, I
    need access to this dataset – the email field is needed for churn analysis.” So
    they log an access request with the purpose of 'churn analysis'.
  sec: 1883
  time: '31:23'
  who: Bart
- line: An access request is when they say, “Okay, this is the field we're interested
    in, but we don't seem to have access to this. This is the reason why we need it
    – because we want to do XYZ.” Right?
  sec: 1916
  time: '31:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Ideally, they also say, “We only need it for three months,” or “We need
    it permanently.” But the point is that you also set the time dimension. Then if
    you have a data owner in the sales domain, they approve it. Then, in an ideal
    case, permissions are automatically updated. If that approval is for three, four
    months – after that period, the permissions are revoked. That revoking access
    is really important. What we've seen (this is pure data access management, not
    data governance) is that one of the issues that we see with data access management
    is excessive privileges – role explosion.
  sec: 1928
  time: '32:08'
  who: Bart
- line: It becomes way too difficult to see who has access to what or you have a lot
    of excessive users with excessive privileges. That's because access is always
    granted and not revoked. I think now, more than ever, with public cloud and all
    the breaches, privacy regulations, but also the upcoming security regulations
    in Europe and the same in the States, you at least need this concept of privilege
    access management. Time-bound access is also part of the best practices I would
    say.

  sec: 2002
  time: '33:22'
  who: Bart

    European Commission is actually there. It's part of the Euro Parliament. So all
    these laws about data privacy are actually made somewhere near you, right?

  sec: 2032
  time: '33:52'
  who: Bart
- line: Okay, I see. [chuckles] So I guess in this case, if I request temporary access
    – if I say, “Hey, I want to do a proof of concept. I want one to see if our churn
    prediction model is actually useful,” then you request access for three months.
    Then, if it's granted, whatever data access management tool we use should automatically
    revoke it after three months, right?
  sec: 2041
  time: '34:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: But you have to look at the development cycle. Typically, data engineers or
    data scientists (data scientists in this case) have to build a new model. They
    request access to the data to build that model. They get it for a couple of months.
    When the model is built and can go into production, the data scientists don't
    need that data anymore. We give access to the service accounts, or the workbench
    that needs the data for the churn prediction model, while access for the data
    scientists becomes revoked. I'm always talking about privacy and security.
  sec: 2064
  time: '34:24'
  who: Bart
- line: You have many regulations pertaining to why you have to limit access. You
    also have [inaudible] and so forth. But it also just prevents you from making
    mistakes. For a lot of people, having the guardrails that prevent them from deleting
    a production table or whatever, can also give peace of mind. So there are a lot
    of benefits in just working with temporary access and knowing that “When I do
    something wrong because I didn't have my coffee in the morning. I have my peace
    of mind knowing that is somewhat limited to the access that I have.”

  who: Bart
- header: Data masking and the importance of automating data access
- line: As a data scientist in the past, I can think of ways where it could potentially
    go wrong. Maybe there is a solution. For example, say we implemented a proof of
    concept. We decided to go ahead with this. It's in production right now and I
    no longer have access to this data because why do I need access to emails of the
    customers? But something happens with our model. It gets broken and then I need
    to go and debug it and figure out what's wrong. If I don't have access to this
    data, how do I actually debug it?
  sec: 2135
  time: '35:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, I don't want to go too much into Raito's solution, because we
    cover all that stuff at Raito, and I don't want to make it a sales pitch. But
    in this case, ideally, you get access to do your investigation. Currently, what
    is broken is the process of requesting, getting access, and revoking access. The
    process does not work. That's why, in your experience as a data scientist, I'm
    sure you've had admin rights. They were just like, “Here, Alexey. Leave me alone.
    Here are admin rights. do your thing.” Right? That's because the process is broken.
  sec: 2171
  time: '36:11'
  who: Bart
- line: We just have to improve the process of requesting, approving, and revoking
    access, so that at all times you only have access to the data that you need, whether
    it's to build a model, to run a model, to investigate data quality issues, or
    why the model is broken and nothing else. But just getting, requesting, and accessing
    the model should be easy and automated where possible, so that at all times it's
    just limited to what you really need.
  sec: 2171
  time: '36:11'
  who: Bart
- header: DPO and CISO roles
- line: Yeah. Well, in defense of the company where I worked, we actually had data
    protection officers. I was not always given admin rights. Maybe to speak about
    this data protection, I remember having a discussion with that person when I needed
    to access some sensitive information like emails. All of a sudden, I got to know
    this person (data protection officer). He was pretty interested in why I needed
    this data and I needed to explain to him why. Do you see this role often – this
    data protection officer role?
  sec: 2239
  time: '37:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: I see them as an important stakeholder. I see companies that I was talking
    to, where you see that the data access management projects actually started because
    DPO was concerned or the CISO is concerned. I mean, it's their responsibility.
    Actually, it's an organization's responsibility to keep their customer data private
    and secure. A good example is Optus in Australia, which has been breached a couple
    of months back. They lost 10% of their customer base after that breach. So customers
    are becoming more and more privacy-aware. As an organization, of course, you have
    to take that responsibility. But it's often driven by the DPO, who has to comply
    with privacy regulations. They have to tell things to the supervisor – they have
    to report on that. They have to tell the supervisor and the customer, “Hey, we
    only use the data for the purposes that we've agreed upon.”
  sec: 2277
  time: '37:57'
  who: Bart
- line: And then the CISO has to make sure that there are no data breaches, no data
    leaks. They have to prevent unauthorized access. For operational systems, that's
    pretty straightforward. But when you look at your data warehouses, your data lakes,
    that's where they lose sleep, because you've got all that data, it's messy, it's
    a lot of data, and you have a lot of change. Then you also have to prevent unauthorized
    access. Data scientists, data analysts, data engineers have to do their job, so
    they need to have access. And on the other end, you have to comply with privacy
    and security regulations. That balance of doing your job, being productive with
    data, giving you a company that competitive edge with data, while keeping it secure
    and private – that's a very difficult battle and it creates friction, such as
    in the example of your DPO at your previous job being like, “What do you need
    to data for? Do you really need it for that purpose? Can you explain it to me?
  sec: 2277

  who: Bart
- line: He would ask these questions all day long.
  sec: 2398
  time: '39:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. And that sucks. It sucks for everybody, right? Because then you have
    to explain to them. Not all DPOs are very technical. They often work more with
    legal texts and with policies. So there's this miscommunication and it just turns
    into policing. It shouldn't be. It should be automated as much as possible. The
    collaboration between the DPO and the data team should be streamlined as much
    as possible. You need to have given the insights and just enable it rather than
    policing.
  sec: 2401
  time: '40:01'
  who: Bart
- line: I was also curious... You actually mentioned two things. We talked about the
    DPO, but you also mentioned the CISO. Can you maybe tell us a bit about these
    roles? Who are these people usually? What's their job? Why do companies actually
    employ them? Why do they care about them?
  sec: 2435
  time: '40:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. They're typically of a certain size. When you're working with sensitive
    data, and as your company reaches a certain size, you will typically see the data
    privacy officer (DPO) and a chief information security officer (CISO). But what
    I've seen is that they've grown towards each other. They used to be two completely
    separate entities. Now, they collaborate more closely. That's because the DPO
    has to rely on the CISO. What does a DPO do? He or she makes sure that the data
    that you, as a customer, give to the organization, is only used for purposes you've
    agreed upon.
  sec: 2455
  time: '40:55'
  who: Bart
- line: If I give you my data for billing (for sending invoices) and I say that you
    cannot use it for marketing, I hope that I don't get marketing emails from you.
    That would create a trust breech. The next one is not always that big, but you
    also have unauthorized access or use by third-parties – by hackers. And that's
    where the CISO comes in. The CISO makes sure that no unauthorized people can have
    access to your data. They keep everything secure. Your DPO makes sure that the
    data is being used in a way and in the context that you, as a customer, can rightly
    expect.

- header: How data access management works with a data mesh approach
- line: Thanks. I noticed that we have three questions. I think it's about time we
    covered them. A question from a Iop. I hope I pronounced your name correctly.
    The question is, “How does one deal with access management in a data mesh setup
    with sensitive data? Usually data producers own it, but for sensitive data, even
    producers shouldn't access it.” Maybe we covered this a little bit, the first
    part, at least. Also, not everyone knows what data mesh is. Maybe you can introduce
    it in just a couple of sentences.
  sec: 2540
  time: '42:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Yeah. Great question, Iop, by the way. First off, data mesh is a new framework
    from ThoughtWorks, from Zhamak. It basically applies the best practices from DevOps
    and data governance, and it applies it to data. There are four principles. I don''t
    know them by heart, I think it''s: data as a product, domain thinking, self-service
    analytics, and federated competition governance. Not 100% certain.'
  sec: 2574
  time: '42:54'
  who: Bart
- line: I have a shameless plug. We also had Zhamak in an interview, so you can check
    it out. I think this may be enough information for those who don't know what it
    is. If you're curious to find out more, you can just go and check that one out.
  sec: 2602
  time: '43:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Indeed. Zhamak would do a much better job than I just did. But it's a great
    point. Like Iop said, often it's the data producers or the data owners that decide
    on who can have access to what. But there's this point of sensitive data, because
    that has to comply with privacy regulations, security standards, and support.
    The way that we see at Raito is that it should still be controlled by your central
    data governance team, who know the regulations, know the privacy standards, and
    it should be automated as much as possible. Then we're looking at column-level
    masking, or row-level filtering, where based on the central policies, these columns
    are automatically masked. A good example is the marketing department, which has
    datasets with customer data, and they say, based on their policies, “Well, John
    and Mary can access this dataset. I approve access.” But in that dataset, there's
    payment card information or home addresses, then there should be a central policy
    that says that these columns should always be masked. And that's something that
    should be automated as much as possible. By the way, we call this the Conway-Benson
    movement, where both teams collaborate on that topic. Great question.
  sec: 2618
  time: '43:38'
  who: Bart
- header: Avoiding the role explosion problem
- line: Another question from the same person. We already spoke about role explosion,
    when we have too many roles, maybe when we forget to revoke access. The question
    is, “Do you have any recommendations for following the least privileged access
    principles without falling into the role explosion problem (when there's a role
    dedicated to each private dataset)?”
  sec: 2695
  time: '44:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: There's a role for each dataset. Right. I see. Tough question. From what I've
    seen, role explosion typically comes when your roles diverge from how the business
    uses data. A couple of things there. We see work with organizations that have
    role inheritance. They have the data roles, which gives you low-level permissions
    on datasets (read/write permissions and so forth) and then they have the functional
    roles that correspond to your roles in the business that can then assume the data
    roles. That's one way. Another reason for role explosion is access requests.
  sec: 2721
  time: '45:21'
  who: Bart
- line: People request access for building an ML model, for investigating issues –
    there's no role that matches that request perfectly, so what you typically do
    is just quickly create a new one, and then forget to revoke it. So I think regular
    reviews and alerts for unused roles will definitely help with that. I think having
    the role inheritance, where you have roles that match with business and roles
    that match with data, combined with regular reviews and alerts on unused rules
    – I think that should help.

- line: Thank you. Make sense. Another question is, and I've been sort of guilty of
    this as well. “Oftentimes, data owners do not know if the data is sensitive or
    not, or maybe they accidentally make a mistake. How does one make sure that we
    have the right processes to catch PII data (personally identifiable information)?”
    I happened to be a data owner at some point, and produced data. I just didn't
    realize that some of this data is actually private or sensitive. Then somebody
    pointed it out after discovering it accidentally (there was no process for that).
    Then, of course, I went to our data catalog and marked this field as sensitive.
    So is there a process for that? How should we deal with these kinds of problems?
  sec: 2802
  time: '46:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Really, the best way to address this is by integrating governance in your
    DataOps process. Once, I was talking to this guy who used to be in a data engineering
    team at Woolworths in Australia with 200 people. He said, “When I started integrating
    data governance in my DataOps, the effort became 1% of what it used to be.” As
    you're creating the data product, you add the tags, and then based on those tags,
    you can have an automated decision process that masks sensitive data. Ideally,
    the data is tagged – that's the ideal scenario. Then data is automatically masked
    based on those tags. Of course, you always need regular reviews. I think having
    good insights in who has access to what, what the usage patterns are and showing
    that in an easy to consume way, will also be very important to catch issues like
    that.
  sec: 2853
  time: '47:33'
  who: Bart
- line: But I guess the question was also about, “If I accidentally mark data as not
    sensitive, even though it is sensitive, is there a way to automatically detect
    that?” Or is it that we just need to work on processes? Maybe we just need to
    have regular reviews?
  sec: 2918
  time: '48:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: So about the tagging itself. Right. There's now this concept of 'active metadata'
    where the metadata is actively matched. You have a lot of automation there. Models
    to help you with the tagging. Not really my field of expertise, but I think there
    are several solutions out there that help with automated data tagging, which can
    help you with that.
  sec: 2937
  time: '48:57'
  who: Bart
- line: With emails, addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, geographical coordinates,
    etc. it's kind of obvious. They follow more or less the same pattern, so there
    are probably automatic ways to detect that.
  sec: 2966
  time: '49:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. These models that are out there, they can indeed use regex patterns
    to detect sensitive data, but they can also use the context of the data itself
    and look at the actual values and add tags in that way. There's a whole field
    that has been developing in that space over the past couple of years. Some of
    them are even open source. There are definitely some solutions out there to help
    with that.

    is...

  who: Alexey
- line: Identity and Access Management.
  sec: 3027
  time: '50:27'
  who: Bart
- line: Right. Then what typically happens is, we use this infrastructure, which is
    called tools such as Terraform, or CloudFormation – all that. There is this infrastructure
    team that manages this code base. And if I need access to something, I need to
    poke these people and say, “Hey, can you please?” I have a role (or my team has
    a role) I want to have access to this S3 bucket, so I need to poke them first.
    Then they say, “Okay, we're too busy. Just create a pull request to this thing.”
  sec: 3031
  time: '50:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: So then I go and make sure that I can actually run this thing on my computer.
    Then I may add this to the Terraform file, then I create a pull request, and they
    take some time to review this pull request – somebody needs to approve it. So
    then somebody approves it, then somebody needs to apply it. Then maybe one month
    later I finally have access, if everything goes smoothly. I guess that's not the
    most ideal scenario, but from my experience, I see that often this is how it starts.
    Right?
  sec: 3031
  time: '50:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's correct. That's indeed how it starts. I think it's a good way to get
    started – with Terraform. Because for most data teams, like I said a bit earlier,
    it's all about proving the value first. So you're really focused on getting those
    first data products out, proving the value of data analytics, getting more data
    consumers on there, more data products on the platform as well. Then that initial
    Terraform script that you used to manage access requests and process to request
    access to Slack or email – they start breaking. It doesn't scale.
  sec: 3094
  time: '51:34'
  who: Bart
- line: That's because 1) It's too technical. For data owners to take ownership, they
    can't go in the Terraform code and start managing access, so it keeps on being
    with the core data team. So it's too technical. If by the time you have a DPO
    or CISO, there is no way of reporting – there's no insight, there's no visibility,
    and there's hardly any automation. 2) You cannot automatically approve or revoke
    access. 3) An issue I heard at a tech scaleup was that they had state drift in
    their access controls. They had access defined in Terraform and it was different
    from what actually was in Snowflake, because other engineers were just directly
    updating permissions in Snowflake. So I think it's a great way to get started.
    It just gets you started. You don't have to worry about access management. That
    is covered.
  sec: 3094
  time: '51:34'
  who: Bart

    manage permissions, the way is – we just build on top of that. I really believe
    in access as code as much as possible – pushing governance left. My vision is,
    “Let's just keep defining data products as code and the roles that can access
    your data products as code. Then everything like access requests, the management,
    the reporting – let's do that in a dedicated tool like Raito, where everybody
    can go to request access and your data engineers are just taken out of the process
    and can focus on cool stuff instead of processing access requests.”

    People have to change their behavior, change their process, and maybe even change
    tools. The way that we do it is by limiting the change that it needs, gradually
    improving data access management. And the way to do that is by letting you start
    from your as-is situation. There's no 'big bang' change. You don't have to disrupt
    everything. We come in and we have a free version of the product. You integrate
    that with your data warehouse or your data lake and from the first day, you instantly
    see who has access to what and what the usage is.

- line: From that place (from your as-is) you can gradually implement or improve your
    access controls through collaboration, insights, and automation. That is like
    the opposite of what other vendors do, which is, “Okay, firstly, find your policies,
    your metadata, and then push down all that change.” And it breaks a lot. There's
    a lot of change all at once. That big bang is something we don't believe in. We
    believe in gradual implementation.

- line: Are there open source alternatives – if somebody is not ready, or somebody
    just wants to make sure they see all the code. Are there alternatives for that?

- line: We have a Raito CLI that is open source, so you can manage access code. Now,
    we have our first contributor, who is building out the report capabilities. We're
    super happy about that. In terms of other open source, what we see all the time
    is Terraform.

- line: Well, since you have an open source thing – we have a thing called Open Source
    Spotlight, where we invite open source authors to demo the tools. You're more
    than welcome to them or Raito CLI. We can organize something. I think that's all
    we have time for today. So thanks, Bart, for joining us today and for sharing
    all this information with us. And thanks, everyone, for joining in, for listening,
    for asking questions. I guess that's all. Thanks, Bart.

    from your team presenting Raito CLI, but I'm looking forward to that.
