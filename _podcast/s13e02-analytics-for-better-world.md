title: Analytics for a Better World
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about improving our world with analytics. We have a
    special guest today, Parvathy. Parvathy is a CTO at Analytics for a Better World,
    a nonprofit organization aiming to use analytic techniques to contribute to sustainable
    development goals. She holds a professional doctorate degree in data science from
    Eindhoven University of Technology. Welcome.

  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you so much, Alexey.
  sec: 95
  time: '1:35'
  who: Parvathy
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks,
    Johanna, for your help. Also I would like to thank Antonis Stellas for introducing
    me to Parvathy. So thanks a lot for that. Let's start.
  sec: 97
  time: '1:37'
  who: Alexey
- header: Parvathy’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of improving our world with analytics, let's
    start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 114
  time: '1:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I started in 2007, in India. I studied for my Bachelor's in electrical
    and electronics engineering. After completing the Bachelor program, I really wanted
    to work in the renewable energy sector because with my background in electrical
    and electronics, it was the obvious choice for me to go into the renewable sector.
    I was also very passionate about sustainable development. At that point, even
    though I didn't know the depth and width of this field, being a very young graduate,
    I did a Master's in energy management and climate change technology.
  sec: 122
  time: '2:02'
  who: Parvathy
- line: I realized that collecting and using data is becoming more and more prominent
    in this field. I started learning a lot of modeling simulation, data analysis,
    specifically in the energy management sector. I started working in India itself.
    I worked in research and development in a few research institutes in India, predominantly
    working with solar photovoltaics and in the data side of that. I saw a really
    good job opportunity in Singapore at that point, at the National University of
    Singapore, where they were collecting a lot of data from cross-climatic photovoltaic
    systems and analyzing it. So I jumped at that opportunity to learn more about
    data science and I applied and got in. I worked there for more than two years.
  sec: 122
  time: '2:02'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Then I realized data is not just usable in the renewable energy sector – it
    can be used for other fields in sustainability as well. And I realized that I
    do not have an education in data science, so I decided to pursue an education
    in that field as well. I moved to the Netherlands and pursued a professional doctorate
    program in TU Eindhoven. I'm currently based in Eindhoven in the Netherlands.
    After graduation, I started working in the public sector, so I started freelancing
    for World Bank and United Nations, specifically UNDP in India, on a series of
    sustainability projects, leading the data part of it across healthcare, transportation,
    infrastructure, and others.
  sec: 122
  time: '2:02'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Last year, the University of Amsterdam, together with some private sector
    players, decided to set up this Analytics for a Better World Institute, and they
    were looking for a CTO. Thanks to my good luck, I got the offer and last year,
    I started working with them. I still continue to consult for both World Bank and
    UN on a series of projects, but the majority of my time, I work as a CTO there.
    That's basically my career journey.
  sec: 122
  time: '2:02'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Hmm, interesting. What do you do there as a CTO?
  sec: 278
  time: '4:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Basically, what Analytics for a Better World does is connect nonprofits with
    research and private sector expertise – not just organizations, but with expertise.
    What we see is that many nonprofits have questions that sometimes require deep
    research, but in many cases, they require things to be set up – scaling, development
    tools, dashboards, visualization, etc. but they internally may not have the capability.
    So what we do at Analytics for a Better World is try to make this connection and
    start projects for nonprofits, either research projects or implementation and
    analytic projects. I lead some of them – I help in brainstorming ideas and coming
    up with digital solutions.
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Also, we try to understand the maturity of the nonprofit. Based on that we
    create a tech and a tool set, because it’s not that with every nonprofit, you
    can directly go to machine learning and deep learning. You need to start smaller
    and iterate fast, because that's the only way we can drive digital transformation.
    We start from the beginning – we ideate, we brainstorm, we understand the level
    of maturity. We have a long term partnership kind of model of working with nonprofits.
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Parvathy
- line: I deal with most of the technical stuff, the data path. We have a managing
    director who looks at more of the business development – making partnerships work,
    the way they work, etc. I sometimes lead data projects and sometimes lead brainstorming
    workshops. I even create curriculum for training and upscaling nonprofits and
    others.
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Parvathy
- header: Brainstorming sessions with nonprofits to establish data maturity
- line: That's a lot of information – I'm trying to process it. [chuckles] So what
    you do is connect nonprofit organizations – you help nonprofit organizations with
    analytics. That means you set up all this technical infrastructure, and even before
    that, you do some brainstorming sessions with them to understand what they actually
    need – what kind of tools they need. Maybe we can start with these brainstorming
    sessions.
  sec: 380
  time: '6:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let's say a nonprofit organization comes to you and says, “Help us with our
    digital transformation.” How do you start that? How do you work with them? What
    things do you talk about in these brainstorming sessions?
  sec: 380
  time: '6:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Usually, we try to understand the different levels of the organization. We
    can summarize this into three categories. We have executives who make long term
    strategy plans for the organization. Then there are managers or project leads
    or program leads or department leads, who put together teams, as well as define,
    deliver and implement projects. Then there are hands-on practitioners who actually
    implement projects. And not all nonprofit projects are data projects. Their goal
    is, let's say, to deliver humanitarian assistance, or to make sure that schools
    in the neighborhood have access to food and electricity. Their goal is totally
    different, but they might have a data component in their project.
  sec: 425
  time: '7:05'
  who: Parvathy
- line: During the brainstorm, what we try to understand is, “Are these different
    levels in the organization? What level of data maturity already exists?” Then
    we try to understand, “What are the things that are required in their strategy
    for them to grow in data science? Do they really need to invest in resources?
    Do they need to invest in infrastructure? Or do they need to invest in a long-term
    strategy and plan?” So we try to understand this through a series of interviews
    with different groups within the organization, and then we try to come up with
    a roadmap.
  sec: 425
  time: '7:05'
  who: Parvathy
- line: But also, not every nonprofit is the same – some nonprofits come to us with
    a really good, already defined problem statement. Then we help them implement
    the solution for it. It totally depends on what level of maturity the nonprofit
    is and whether they already have a problem statement. I would say it depends on
    the nonprofit, but this gives you a flavor of how those brainstorming sessions
    work.
  sec: 425
  time: '7:05'
  who: Parvathy
- header: Example of an Analytics for a Better World project
- line: Just curious – I don't know if you can tell us or not – but maybe you can
    just pick an example without naming the organizations, or if you can name them
    that would also be interesting and then a project that you did for them recently.
    It would be interesting to see how you took it from the start and then worked
    on that – did the brainstorm, defined the roadmap, and then worked on the solution.
  sec: 540
  time: '9:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, definitely. I can give you one example. This is not a direct example
    of a project because we cannot divulge all the information due to privacy and
    other reasons. Last year, in October, we started an academy where we trained nonprofits.
    It was an open, free program where we invited nonprofits from around the globe
    to apply – for practitioners. We received more than 340 applications from around
    the globe. From that, we selected 43 fellows, or nonprofit data practitioners
    to work with us, and go through an eight-week program.
  sec: 569
  time: '9:29'
  who: Parvathy
- line: In the first few weeks, they did some data science courses. Then in the second
    half, we brainstormed with them, “In your nonprofit, let's try to identify a problem
    that you would like to solve.” I will give one example from the United Nations
    environment program in Nairobi, Kenya. We worked with a fellow from there who
    had a problem – in Kenya, waste management is a huge issue. What they were seeing
    on the ground was that there were not enough waste collection points throughout
    the city. They wanted to use analytics and optimization models to understand how
    we can improve the situation. What we did is paired them up with mentors who are
    already experienced data scientists. We paired them up with some of our trainers
    from university, doing some optimization research, because it requires mathematical
    modeling as well.
  sec: 569
  time: '9:29'
  who: Parvathy
- line: They jointly did a very simple proof of concept pilot, where they used data
    that is openly available – population densities, onto which they overlaid the
    road network data and other data, to say “This is where you need to establish
    more waste collection points.” It was an AP program, of course, and the brainstorming
    came up with a really solid idea to take forward. Now, what we are doing is –
    we are having the student plus a small team supporting them to scale this up.
    Because that was a proof of concept and it worked fine as a test case, but now
    we are working with them to implement it as a proper solution that even uses,
    for example, satellite imagery to identify large scale dumping ground surveys
    to see if maybe in those areas, you need not just a data solution, but you might
    need more advocacy for waste segregation and plastic waste collection.
  sec: 569
  time: '9:29'
  who: Parvathy
- line: This is one example where we started with just a brainstorming and an idea,
    and we went all the way to actually developing a solution. I just want to make
    this very clear – the data part is just one part of the solution. You have other
    parts – you need to have public officials, you need to have advocacy for better
    data collection, you need to have advocacy for on-the-ground training for people
    to actually do this segregation. So the data part is helping the official reach
    there, but there is much more beyond that to get the solution to work and scale.
  sec: 569
  time: '9:29'
  who: Parvathy
- header: The overall data maturity situation of nonprofits vs private sector
- line: Yeah. I don't know if I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but I expect that the level
    of maturity when it comes to data in these organizations (in the public sector)
    is probably lower compared to a typical internet startup – a typical internet
    company. Is it a correct observation? What kind of level of data maturity do you
    usually see in these organizations?
  sec: 753
  time: '12:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: It also depends on the nonprofits themselves. There are some nonprofits, or
    development sector organizations, that have really good maturity in terms of digital.
    They have a data science team, they might already have data scientists working
    with them from other organizations, they might have research teams, etc. But if
    you look at the overall landscape – yes, there is a resource gap. There is a lot
    of need for data scientists in the sector. The sector also has huge competition
    with the private sector, because the private sector has a lot of need for data
    scientists as well. Thus, the data scientists have an option to choose either
    to work in a public or a private sector company.
  sec: 783
  time: '13:03'
  who: Parvathy
- line: In many cases, what I see is – in a nonprofit, data is not their first order
    of business, like I said before. Their main goal is not to collect and analyze
    data, but their goal is something else and data is one part of it. Therefore,
    you also need data scientists who have that kind of affinity to work with them
    – who understand the big picture and not just start developing machine learning
    every time they see some dataset, but to understand where to contextualize it.
    There is definitely a resource gap and there is huge demand. I think I mentioned
    before that the academy that we set up – it was our first time setting up an academy
    and we are a new organization. We do not have that much visibility yet.
  sec: 783
  time: '13:03'
  who: Parvathy
- line: We do have a lot of partners and nonprofits working with us, but if you look
    at it, we are relatively new. Even then, we received so many applications from
    top organizations around the world and it really shows that there is a need. Another
    thing I have to mention is that it was a free program. Usually, in free educational
    programs, the dropout rate is high and the retention isn’t great. Because it's
    an eight week program, there can be much fewer people who actually graduate. But
    we did not have that problem at all because we really looked at the motivation
    and the fellows were motivated throughout the program. Therefore, we had a really
    high retention rate, attendance, and program completion rate. I have to say that
    there were extremely motivated resources that existed, but there is a huge skill
    gap – yes.
  sec: 783
  time: '13:03'
  who: Parvathy
- header: Solving for the skill gap
- line: How do you solve this skill gap? I imagined that, if you compare the public
    sector with the private sector, I suspect that the typical internet companies
    that are in the private sector can probably pay more. Right? This makes it kind
    of hard to compete, because people who graduate from university, or people who
    are already experienced – they might want to go there because data maturity is
    maybe better there, there's better compensation, and other things. So how do you
    actually manage to close this gap and manage to find people who want to work in
    the public sector? People who want to contribute? How do you do this?
  sec: 923
  time: '15:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: What we see, at least, is that nowadays, young people are extremely driven
    by purpose, and not always financial benefits alone. I have worked both in the
    private and public sector, and I wouldn't speak for the rest of the world, but
    sometimes when you are working, especially in the public sector, you get that
    sense of purpose much more than when you're working in a private sector company.
    It's not always the same for all companies. Disclaimer here. But what we tried
    to help with… and I think one organization alone cannot solve this problem – it
    is a huge problem and we need partnerships and we need a combined effort from
    different organizations to actually achieve this.
  sec: 970
  time: '16:10'
  who: Parvathy
- line: But I can talk about what we try to do to help. We have Analytics for a Better
    World courses, both here at University of Amsterdam, and MIT. Actually, our Science
    to Impact co-director is currently in Boston giving that course. We do this course
    both at the Bachelor level and Master’s level. This is for, let's say, training
    new young people to know that there is this split. Everybody is not aware that
    there is this split in where they can go after they do a program in data science.
    It’s also to get them excited that the problems are actually quite mathematically
    challenging as well. It's not really straightforward problems that we have to
    solve. It's quite mentally challenging. [cross-talk]
  sec: 970
  time: '16:10'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Like one you mentioned about waste management, right? It's a very difficult
    problem – where exactly do you put these waste collectors? It's a difficult modeling
    problem.
  sec: 1061
  time: '17:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is. It's very exciting to solve it. Not just from a social perspective,
    but as a technical person, I get challenging problems and I get really excited.
    We, as an organization, want to inspire young people to realize that this is definitely
    possible. There are these interesting problems to solve out there. Secondly, we
    also see that a lot of nonprofits already have people working with data, and we
    want to upskill them. Plus, we also want to get organizations to invest in improving
    their data maturity. Because like you said before, a lot of data scientists need
    to feel that they are working in a more mature organization, to understand how
    they can contribute and they need to have all the tools and techniques and support
    to develop these solutions.
  sec: 1073
  time: '17:53'
  who: Parvathy
- line: That's exactly why I mentioned these three levels. We have executives, we
    have managers or analytics translators (a very commonly used term), and then we
    have data science practitioners. At Analytics for a Better World, we have an academy
    and through the Academy, we hosted a program for practitioners last year that
    involves hands-on data science skills. This year, we will repeat that cohort,
    plus we are adding a new course for analytics translators. And in the pipeline
    for next year, we have plans to post a program for executives as well. But we
    need some more preparation time for it because for practitioners, we have eight
    weeks, for analytics translators, it's going to be a shorter program, and for
    executives, it has to be two days or so, because you're getting them engaged for
    more. The curriculum requires more research and that's exactly what we are doing
    now.
  sec: 1073
  time: '17:53'
  who: Parvathy
- line: We are planning to interview a lot of executives who are working in the nonprofits
    to develop their curriculum. It is also difficult to set up a curriculum for them.
    I mean, you probably know there is Coursera, there’s Udemy – there is so much
    data science content out there. But how do we tailor it for nonprofits? And how
    do we tailor a curriculum which speaks to them and their language? It's also not
    very easy, so we are also learning in the process. Last year was a success and
    we are very happy about that, but we can still improve and we are working on doing
    a lot of research into developing such a curriculum for these three levels within
    organizations.
  sec: 1073
  time: '17:53'
  who: Parvathy
- header: Publicly available content
- line: As I understood, in summary, you solve the skill gap by education. You educate
    people at different levels. You start with the students from universities, like
    MIT and University of Amsterdam, but then you also work with the companies and
    upskill people there on all the three levels that you mentioned. I'm wondering
    – you create a lot of educational content. Is any of this content publicly available?
    Do you maybe have courses from MIT or University of Amsterdam somewhere in public?
  sec: 1214
  time: '20:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: We are huge proponents of open source, as you can probably imagine. That's
    the whole purpose of this. Whatever we develop, for example, for the fellowship,
    most of the lectures you can find in our YouTube channel. Of course, the interactive
    sessions and the mentoring cannot be captured completely. But the courses are
    there. Many of the lectures from the Bachelor's and Master's program give workshops
    specifically about these for students. We also do a lot of showcases of our projects
    for people to see. It is all available in the open domain.
  sec: 1249
  time: '20:49'
  who: Parvathy
- line: If I can add one more thing, not just about the Academy, but we also have
    a GitHub repository where whatever we are developing for nonprofits (not the data,
    of course, the data is proprietary and it stays with the nonprofit) but the algorithms
    and models, if we see it is applicable for other use cases, we make them also
    openly available. We try not to use proprietary tools in general, but in some
    cases, we cannot escape this. [chuckles] But in most of the cases, we try to use
    open source. Both knowledge and any deliverables or results, we openly make available.
  sec: 1249
  time: '20:49'
  who: Parvathy
- header: The Analytics for a Better World Academy
- line: That's really cool. Please send us the links to these resources, so we will
    include them in the show notes. But I'm wondering, maybe you can tell us more
    about these courses that you have with the universities. What kind of modules
    do you have there? What is the focus? What do you teach there?
  sec: 1327
  time: '22:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I do not teach myself. We have a Science to Impact co-directors – two professors.
    One is Professor Dimitris Bertsimas, he is from MIT Sloan School of Management.
    And then of course, in Amsterdam, we have Professor Dick den Hertog. They are
    the ones who are leading, let's say, most of the educational programs in universities.
    And we have other professors like ‪Joaquim Gromicho, who also takes sessions.
    So it's not just us, we have a big extended team behind us who does these courses.
  sec: 1346
  time: '22:26'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Just to give you, in a nutshell, what the courses talk about, if you look
    at the data analytics ascendancy metrics, as we call it, you usually start with
    descriptive analytics, which is just knowing about what is happening and you visualize,
    you get the data clean and all those things. Then you do diagnostic analysis,
    where you see why things happen and what the root causes are. Then you can do
    prediction – you can forecast, you can create early warning systems, you can make
    machine learning models, you can do some image detection, geospatial analysis.
    But the last step, which is quite difficult, and it is more impactful, and that’s
    optimization. This talks about, “How can we make things better?”
  sec: 1346
  time: '22:26'
  who: Parvathy
- line: I will give you a very quick example of what we did with the World Bank, or
    what we are actually continuing to do with the World Bank. We went to Timor-Leste,
    together with the World Bank to study how the current hospital network in Timor-Leste
    is and whether people actually have access to primary health care centers. We
    made a map of all the population points, we mapped the existing hospitals, we
    mapped roads, then we calculated the travel distances and we see that at five
    kilometers, 10 kilometers, 15 kilometers – how many people or what percentage
    of people have access? Now, this is descriptive. Basically, you just know that
    asset scenario, but then we try to do some more analysis to see why this is so.
    Is it just the road network? Is it that new hospitals are required?
  sec: 1346
  time: '22:26'
  who: Parvathy
- line: But then, the last step is the prescriptive part, where we are actually using
    a mathematical model to say, “Where do you place new hospitals now?” That is a
    decision-making point. Because knowing all the previous steps is necessary to
    make that decision, but that model – the optimization model – is what will give
    you the decision-making capability to say, “Put a hospital in this county, or
    subcounty, to give access to X people more in the population. And this is going
    to cost you X amount. If you have 5 more, you go from 50 to 100% (just an example,
    of course.)” But giving that power is what we try to incorporate into all our
    training programs. How you can actually go from descriptive and diagnostic to
    this optimization model and how you can use mathematics or other things to actually
    come up with that decision-making capability. I think that summarizes the core
    of all our training programs.
  sec: 1346
  time: '22:26'
  who: Parvathy
- header: The Academy’s target audience
- line: From what I understood, of course, you have training product programs and
    each of them has a different target audience. But the ones in these universities
    – MIT and University of Amsterdam – what is the main target audience? Is it people
    that study management or is it people who study data science and analytics? Are
    they more technical, or are they less technical?
  sec: 1536
  time: '25:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a good question. They are technical. We have, for example, an MBA in
    Big Data program. That's an MBA program, but they have a Big Data component. They
    do learn some of this. We also have a Business Analytics course, both here and
    at MIT – the Sloan School of Management. These are the kinds of students who take
    up these courses.
  sec: 1570
  time: '26:10'
  who: Parvathy
- line: But we also have been brainstorming (it's not done yet) on seeing if healthcare
    or education or these kinds of programs can also have such components. But that's
    just an idea at this point. Like you asked, in universities, most of our courses
    are targeting students who are learning business analytics or MBA in Big Data
    – so both management as well as technical.
  sec: 1570
  time: '26:10'
  who: Parvathy
- line: So they already know analytics, and you just show them the application of
    analytics for nonprofits. Right?
  sec: 1622
  time: '27:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Nonprofits, and also maybe a more of optimization kind of problems. So we
    teach them more prescriptive analytics.
  sec: 1632
  time: '27:12'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Yes, but the point is that they already know analytics. You just show them
    how they can apply this to solve real-world problems. Okay. That must be quite
    inspiring, I imagine.
  sec: 1640
  time: '27:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, the feedback we get from students – they are all very excited. We have
    a lot of them working with nonprofits during their thesis as well. That shows
    that they do get inspired and they want to work with nonprofits for their thesis.
    Interestingly, we also get requests from other students who are not really from
    these programs, writing to us asking if they can do their thesis with us. We do
    encourage that as well. These are not just open to the University of Amsterdam,
    or MIT, or any of their affiliate universities. We do encourage other students
    to also come and work with us and do their thesis.

- line: I see this question coming up in the community in Slack quite often. People
    come and ask, “Hey, I need to write a thesis, but I have no idea what to write
    about. Can you suggest good topics?” So maybe for these people, for these students,
    who come and ask these questions – how can they contact you and find out how they
    can help with their skills and how can they take part in this? What's the best
    way of doing this? Maybe you have a public list somewhere with possible topics?
    How do they go about this?
  sec: 1699
  time: '28:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, this is not that straightforward, because we usually define it together
    with nonprofits and the problem can evolve over time. So it's not like there is
    a list somewhere and people just choose. It is a bit more personal, let's say.
    Just to give one example, we have a student who says they want to do a thesis
    with us. We know that some of our nonprofits have some pressing issues. We send
    the student and the nonprofit to a brainstorming session together with us to define
    a problem statement that works for both of them. Because it's not just that it
    should match what the nonprofit wants, it should also appeal to the students.

    as well and be passionate about it. I wouldn't say it is that industrialized yet
    where they can choose, but they can always reach out to us. In our website, we
    have a page specifically for researchers and students, where they can just write
    a message. We always get back to them. I think you also have our LinkedIn page,
    you have my LinkedIn, Robert’s LinkedIn – you can just reach out to us. We are
    always open to all these. We are not so busy that we don't have time to answer
    these questions. So just reach out to us personally.
  sec: 1736

    is – if there is somebody, a student in India or in Germany or any other country,
    which is from a university that is not MIT or University of Amsterdam – if there
    is a student and if they want to write a thesis with you, what they do is go to
    your website, where there is a section for students and researchers. They simply
    contact you, and then you take it from there?

- header: Improving data maturity in nonprofit organizations
- line: Okay. I want to go back a bit, to when we discussed your different educational
    initiatives. One of the things you mentioned was that you want to improve data
    maturity of existing organizations, and you do this by upskilling people, and
    perhaps something more.
  sec: 1847
  time: '30:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm really curious, how exactly do you go about this? You work with an organization
    and you see that the data maturity could be improved, so what are your next steps?
    What do you do for that?
  sec: 1847
  time: '30:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: First, we need to measure the level to actually improve it. We do a series
    of interviews, like I said. We also have standard questionnaires, standard formats
    for measuring maturity, let's say. Then, using the template, we say, “Okay, currently
    you are here in terms of people or processes in technology.” It is not just about
    technology, it's about the process and people as well. Then, together with the
    management, we look at their strategy for the next year, three years, five years,
    etc. Then we say that, “Based on this strategy, this is the roadmap.”
  sec: 1880
  time: '31:20'
  who: Parvathy
- line: We help them create a roadmap for data and digital transformation, “You need
    to upskill people around these sectors. These are the options for fundraising.
    These are the training programs. Also, these are the tools that you can internally
    use to maximize operational efficiency.” Because sometimes we see that a process
    is not correct. They have set up something, but it needs some optimizations there,
    and we help them set it up. So it's not just about training, but it goes much
    further beyond that. I can give one example without naming the nonprofit. We saw
    in the nonprofit that there is already an Azure Cloud environment setup, but there
    were configurations which were actually not optimized. They were spending more
    money than necessary.
  sec: 1880
  time: '31:20'
  who: Parvathy
- line: A lot of the unused resources or clusters were not turned off, or they were
    still running, which ran up costs. There we had to, first of all, shut them down
    to reduce cost, but also we had to come up with a standard operating procedure
    so that the next time, anything in the organization set it up, they followed a
    set of criteria. “If you're no longer using it, this is what you have to do.”
    So it's not just about shutting it down and optimizing, you have to document it
    and make them aware that these are the standard operating procedures.
  sec: 1880
  time: '31:20'
  who: Parvathy
- line: 'Again, I have to go back to what I was saying – it''s totally dependent on
    the nonprofit. Some nonprofits require more investments in people, some more in
    technology, but we kind of try to tailor the whole process to the nonprofit. In
    any case, usually it goes: maturity scan, discussions, and then we create a roadmap.
    We help them implement the roadmap in stages. It’s not like you come and change
    the whole organization all at once – it''s a long process. Usually, we have short-term
    goals and long-term goals in the roadmap. And we implement it in pieces.'

    and tech? What exactly do you look at?'
  sec: 2046
  time: '34:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Like I said, if the strategy of an organization, let's say, is to collect
    and analyze more health-related indicators. This is just one example. Say they
    are working on the ground with healthcare professionals and hospitals. We look
    at, “Are they collecting the right amount of data? Are they having the capacity
    to analyze this data?” That is where resources are measured. [cross-talk]
  sec: 2067
  time: '34:27'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Is this the tech part or the people part or the process part?
  sec: 2092
  time: '34:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, let's start with the people part. If you look at people – say they
    need people who know how to collect the right amount of data, people who know
    how to structure the questions, let's say, or even set up that collection system
    or a mobile app to collect this data.
  sec: 2094
  time: '34:54'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Researchers, social scientists, or people who have this background of asking
    questions and making sure they're not biased and all that stuff, right?
  sec: 2115
  time: '35:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Plus, you need some technical experts or data science people who can
    help them create a web app and connect it via an API to an analytics part. So
    it has to be a team including, let's say, people who can set up the questionnaire,
    but also digitally collect the information, put it into a server somewhere, host
    it, etc. You need a team who can do all this, right? That is the people part.
  sec: 2127
  time: '35:27'
  who: Parvathy
- line: So if they have a team, then they are already more or less mature. If there
    is no team, then you understand, “Okay, there is a gap. If you want to collect
    data, how are you going to do this if there are no people who know how to do this?”
    Right?
  sec: 2158
  time: '35:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Let's say that there are people who can collect data, but there is no
    analytics capability – no people who can analyze this data to make decisions –
    then they are at a different stage in their maturity. But if they don't have any
    data collection at all, then they are at a different stage. If they do everything,
    then they are totally at a different stage. So there are groups of categories.
  sec: 2171
  time: '36:11'
  who: Parvathy
- line: I understand. Okay. And then the process part – what is there?
  sec: 2194
  time: '36:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: In the process part, we look at, “What is the process that the team has to
    go through to set up this system? Organizationally, do they have all the support
    required? Are they actually looking at privacy security? Are they following all
    the best practices out there?” You can create a form and anybody can create a
    form, but “Are they actually following the best practices? Are they following
    the right order of things? For example, before collecting a form, is there clear
    guidance from the management or from the team? Who needs this data? Why do they
    want to use this data?” So you need to have that process clearly defined and in
    stages, so they know that they are doing the right thing in the right order. That
    will be the process part.
  sec: 2199
  time: '36:39'
  who: Parvathy
- line: So having zero processes means low maturity. If there are some processes,
    then it's mid level. And if there is a process that explains everything, like
    you mentioned, these standard operating procedures – if they have these things
    in place and if everyone knows how exactly to collect data, or process data, or
    delete things that are not being used, what the sequences of steps that you need
    to do for that, then it's good. Right?
  sec: 2253
  time: '37:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You are saying three categories, but there are many more. It's not that
    clear-cut. It's fuzzy. It is not just three levels – there is like a whole “level
    of maturity” scan. But you are right in the overall picture, yes.
  sec: 2285
  time: '38:05'
  who: Parvathy
- line: And then the tech part, I guess, is also quite interesting. You mentioned
    the cloud at some point, right? So what are the stages there, in the tech dimension?
  sec: 2302
  time: '38:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: So in the tech part, I would say, “Do they have a collaborative working style?”
    Because in many case, you will be working [cross-talk]
  sec: 2312
  time: '38:32'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Like Git?
  sec: 2322
  time: '38:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, like Git, of course. “Are they all working on their local machines,
    having local copies of the data? Or do they have a centralized one source of truth?
    Is everything accessible? Is the tech configured properly? Also, from the organizational
    side, are they aware of the technologies that they require from the management?”
    We look at that as well, in terms of technology – not just whether they are using
    it, but are they aware of what the alternatives are and whether they have chosen
    something that is best. We look at their tech stack, we look at their analytics
    stack, and see if something needs to be optimized. So that will be the technology
    aspect.
  sec: 2323
  time: '38:43'
  who: Parvathy
- header: Typical tools that Analytics for a Better World recommends to nonprofits
- line: Yeah, I kind of wanted to use this as a segue to talk about different technologies
    and analytical tools. What are the tools that you typically see or typically recommend
    that your clients use? How do you go about suggesting these tools to the customers?
  sec: 2368
  time: '39:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: That also depends on the maturity of the organization, but we have a few sets
    of categories. We do not usually make decisions for the nonprofits, but we give
    them the options and the pros and cons of each, if they don't have anything, let's
    say. Let’s just take the example of data visualization. Within the organization,
    if they want to make dashboards, many organizations prefer one platform, which
    they are already using, and they are aware of, like Power BI or Tableau. So they
    already have capabilities that they use, then we try to upskilling them in that,
    because they usually have a shared platform and the organization has invested
    in it. So we try to upskill them in that.
  sec: 2390
  time: '39:50'
  who: Parvathy
- line: As an organization, we do not have priorities for any technology, to be very
    fair. We look at the nonprofit agency and see that they already have capabilities
    in something, then we try to identify from our side, if there are people who can
    help the nonprofit in those particular technologies. And when we see the technologies,
    we also try to tell them if there are open source alternatives or tools, for example,
    Python, or others, that are very easy to configure for a data scientist, but then
    connect them to good visualization and dashboarding so that the managers and executives
    don't get too overwhelmed with the results so that they aren’t afraid to make
    decisions. From the technology point of view, we see a lot of dashboarding because
    many organizations are at the beginning their transformation journey. So they
    are still exploring visualizing data.
  sec: 2390
  time: '39:50'
  who: Parvathy
- line: When we need to do machine learning or predictions, we prefer Python or R,
    depending on the organization. Then, when we have to develop a product and deploy
    it, we suggest different cloud options, like Azure, AWS, or GCP. Then we see which
    one fits the organization best. Many nonprofits already have such environments
    set up, and in this case we try to stick with that and go with that instead of
    changing the entire thing. Because, like I said, we do not really have any priorities
    in tools. Just to add, from the technology point of view, we see that a lot of
    nonprofits have different types of data.
  sec: 2390
  time: '39:50'
  who: Parvathy
- line: It's not always just an Excel file with so many rows or data frames – they
    have a lot of geospatial data, they have a lot of text data. To handle these,
    they might need different technologies. For example, for geospatial data, they
    might need more knowledge in platforms like QGIS. And for text mining in Python
    itself, they need to know more about packages that specifically deal with text.
    So we try to identify that as well and then suggest a tech stack that will fit
    their requirements.
  sec: 2390
  time: '39:50'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Just to summarize, you mentioned multiple categories – you mentioned database
    visualization, which could be tools like Power BI, Tableau, or some open source
    alternatives. Then you also mentioned machine learning, where you suggest going
    with things like Python, or Python packages, and R. Then you also mentioned cloud
    a way to deploy these machine learning solutions, for which you mentioned Azure
    and others. What are the other categories? I think you mentioned a few specific
    examples like geospatial data, text data, and for them, there are specific tools.
    Do you have any other categories when it comes to maybe collecting data or storing
    data or something like that?
  sec: 2572
  time: '42:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: We currently see these categories in nonprofits, like dashboarding, visualization
    – we have Python, R and of course for deployment. By other technologies, do you
    mean defining technologies or defining categories? What exactly?
  sec: 2621
  time: '43:41'
  who: Parvathy
- line: What kind of categories are there? I imagine that you need to keep the data
    somewhere, so maybe you have some data warehousing solutions. Or maybe you need
    to collect data, so you need some data tracking solutions. What are the categories
    you look at?
  sec: 2641
  time: '44:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: For data warehousing and storing data, a lot of nonprofits prefer open platforms.
    There are solutions specifically made for nonprofits, so they tend to use that.
    We see a lot of PostgreSQL databases because it's open. We also see KoboToolbox
    being used, actually, which is part of the Digital Public Goods Alliance. It is
    meant for nonprofits to collect data in a structured format, even including images
    and storing them securely. KoboToolbox has a humanitarian section which is built
    specifically for nonprofits, and it's registered in the Digital Public Goods registry.
  sec: 2658
  time: '44:18'
  who: Parvathy
- line: So there are specific tools that nonprofits do use and prefer, and they are
    specifically targeted and made for them, which is amazing. They all follow what
    we call the nine Principles of Digital Development. That's one of the resources
    that maybe the viewers will also be interested in seeing. It's about developing
    solutions that can scale, specifically in the public and nonprofit sector. There
    are tools like KoboToolbox that are very frequently used. Also, like I said, for
    data collection and databases, they use PostgreSQL quite frequently as well.
  sec: 2658
  time: '44:18'
  who: Parvathy
- header: Profiles in nonprofits
- line: I’m wondering what kind of profiles there are for these tools. I imagine that
    you need different profiles – data analysts would be usually more involved in
    data visualization and using these data storage databases like Postgres to analyze
    the data, maybe also collect data. Then, perhaps, for the data scientist profile,
    the data scientists are more involved in machine learning, training models, and
    also getting data, deploying them to the cloud.
  sec: 2751
  time: '45:51'

    some other people who are also in the data world?

- line: 'This is also totally dependent on the nonprofits themselves, but many of
    them that we see, if they are at lower levels of maturity – you see a lot of unicorns,
    let''s say. [chuckles] They try to do everything because there is a resource gap.
    These roles: data scientists, data analysts, data engineers, architects, cloud
    engineers, MLOps – these are all somehow merged together. There is not a clear
    definition – I think even in private sector companies, there’s not always a clear
    line. So it is not always very clear what rules there are. But if you look at
    a particular project, I can tell you that in a team, there are always people who
    are, let''s say, collecting and analyzing data.'
  sec: 2796
  time: '46:36'
  who: Parvathy
- line: There are always people who try to make business decisions out of the data
    – who are trying to understand what these models are saying and putting it into
    the context of operations. And usually, in nonprofits, we see a lot of research
    teams who are looking at it from a totally different, research perspective, because
    they need to know what more data has to be collected and what more use cases can
    be developed. We see a lot of data science profiles, but to be very fair, most
    of the nonprofits are not at the stage where they are deploying large scale machine
    learning models on cloud. It's just not there yet, at least with the nonprofits
    we work with, or the development sector organizations we work with. This is not
    what we see. Most of them are still defining key performance indicators, so it's
    still descriptive, and in some cases predictive.
  sec: 2796
  time: '46:36'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Just one example is an early warning system. You might have heard that the
    Great Horn of Africa has had the biggest drought in many, many years. How can
    you predict or give early warning for these kinds of situations so governments
    can act well in advance? So early warning systems – a lot of prediction on weather
    and climate using satellite-based observations and historic data – a lot of these
    things are done. But when it comes to deploying to large-scale models, I do not
    see a lot of such applications. Right now I don't see a lot of MLOps or cloud
    architects in the sector yet.
  sec: 2796
  time: '46:36'
  who: Parvathy
- header: Does Analytics for a Better World have a need for data engineers?
- line: I understand. Well, the reason I'm asking about this is that right now, we
    have a course. It's happening right now – we're on week four. The course is about
    data engineering. In this course, we show how to use different tools for collecting,
    storing, and processing data. The focus is more on, “How do you move data from
    one place to another place in a reliable and reproducible way?” Also, as part
    of the project, they will need to create a dashboard. So what I want to ask is
    – if people with this kind of profile want to take part in some of your initiatives,
    how can they do this? Or do you even need people with these kinds of skills?
  sec: 2955
  time: '49:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: We do need them, definitely. But it is not like nonprofits are going to directly
    hire them. Not all nonprofits – there are some who need this, but because there
    is no constant source of these kinds of projects. But we do see some of these
    applications and I can give you one very simple example. We work with a researcher
    who has developed a very amazing solution for smallholder farmers in Brazil. It's
    a very impactful model that they have demonstrated on the ground. But how do you
    build that gap between research and then scaling and deploying it? We want to
    create a mobile application that will fetch all the required data and process
    it – immediately give results so that they can immediately act on it. This has
    to happen, because it's not just visualization – we are running machine learning
    models at the backend to give those results, right? We were looking for the right
    set of people to support such a project.
  sec: 3006
  time: '50:06'
  who: Parvathy
- line: Another example, as I told you about, in Timor-Leste – we went and we were
    optimizing for the location of healthcare facilities. We saw that a lot of these
    use cases recurrently appear. For example, we worked together with the World Health
    Organization during the COVID pandemic in Nepal and they wanted to know, “Where
    should we place COVID test labs?” So it's a similar problem to what Timor-Leste
    did, but the data stack is different. We are actually building a web application
    where in the backend, these optimization models will run and give you results
    depending on the data and the country that you feed it. For bigger countries,
    it is actually a very resource-intensive problem.
  sec: 3006
  time: '50:06'
  who: Parvathy
- line: If you look at Vietnam, we tried to do this in Vietnam for healthcare facility
    access – the population is huge. It's a large area to run this optimization model.
    It requires a lot of resources. So yeah, we do need machine learning engineers
    for specific projects and we need these deployment capabilities. We are always
    looking for such people who want to join this mission. But also be aware that
    it is not like we are constantly looking for these resources. It comes when such
    interesting projects come to us.
  sec: 3006

    if you have them now.

  time: '52:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now, no. Not as far as this morning, let’s say. [chuckles] Things change
    very fast. But what we also try to do is – we have a list of people and resources
    that we can tap into, so when a project comes, we can reach out to them. Also,
    like I said, we have a lot of private sector organizations who are our partners.
    One of these examples is Ortec. Ortec is one of the founding partners of Analytics
    for a Better World, together with the University of Amsterdam. They are a mathematical
    optimization company.

    resources who can work on this project for four months, (or five months, or sometimes
    one week or two weeks, depending on the project, of course).” But we would really
    love to welcome others who would like to contribute as well and see if we can

    director, Robert. I am the CTO. We have Prof. Dick den Hertog and Prof. Dimitris
    Bertsimas who are Science to Impact co-directors, and they lead Research Academy
    and other ventures. We also have other data scientists who are working kind of
    full-time with us. One is Claudia, who’s based in the University of Amsterdam.
    We have Brett, who's a PhD student. We also have other researchers supporting
    us. But we are a very small core team.
  sec: 3247

    have supporters from our organizations that are supporting us. Just to give an
    example, during the Academy, we had more than 20 professionals from the private
    sector giving courses. All of them came from our network – from the people who
    are in organizations – and if I can look at the number of projects we currently
    have around four or five running in parallel. All of them are staffed with like
    three or four people, but it's not always data scientists. We sometimes have data
    scientists, data engineers, and others. So we do have an extended network and
    a big team, but our core team is very small.

- header: Factors that help organizations become more data-driven
- line: Thanks. We have a question from Antonis, but I should have asked this question
    earlier. I don't know if you'll be able to answer it in two minutes, but we can
    try. The question is, “What are the most important factors that help organizations
    become more data-driven? Organizations that you worked with and organizations
    that, perhaps, start from zero data maturity and then eventually become data driven
    – what are the most important factors that help them?”

    asked “What are the factors?” If I have to explain that, two minutes is not enough.
    [chuckles] So I''ll tell you what the main factor that we see is. This includes
    organizations that have a strategy and an understanding that data is required,
    organizations that are motivated to come up with projects, and want to upskill
    their people to become more data-intensive in their work. They need to make the
    right investments. And for investments you need drive from the organization perspective
    as well. Like I said before, the investments have to be in three sectors: people,
    processes, and technology. Understanding this as an organization is the most important
    thing.'

- line: We see a lot of value in data and analytics being added into the public sector
    organizations. We believe, truly, from what we have seen in the last year, nonprofits
    can benefit equally from data. But as an organization, most of them know that
    data is important, but have not made it a strategic part of their goal yet, in
    many cases. I think that a clear vision and strategy to include data is the first
    step. After that come all the investments on people, processes, and technology,
    as well as a clear understanding of why and how data can be used. And that's what
    we try to do with our Academy – making them realize “How can data help?” That's
    not always very obvious, I think.

- line: You don't immediately see results, right? Especially in nonprofits, you cannot
    see the healthcare system in a country improving in one day – it takes years to
    see real impact. Of course, there are outputs and outcomes from programs and upskilling
    initiatives, but to see the change, it takes time. Having that patience and long-term
    vision is equally important. Thanks for the question. It's a really good one.
    I wish I had more time to answer it. [chuckles]

- header: Parvathy’s resource recommendations
- line: Yeah, I should have asked that a bit earlier. Maybe one last question. This
    is usually the question I ask everyone – do you have any good book or resource
    that you can recommend to the listeners? I think one thing you mentioned is all
    these educational initiatives that you have. That would be a great resource that
    you probably will recommend to the listeners. Is there anything else that you
    would add to that?

- line: 'Resources? For, I always read a lot of technical stuff. For example, I spend
    every day reading at least 30 minutes in Towards Data Science. [chuckles] It''s
    very techy, but I really love it. On books, I can recommend a book that I just
    finished reading. It''s called The Culture Map: Breaking Through the Invisible
    Boundaries of Global Business. It''s about how different people from across the
    world – because we usually live in our bubble and we know what is happening in
    our neighborhood, we know what is happening in TV media, but world is so much
    bigger and in different cultures, you have to understand the context of how people
    think, lead, and get things done. It''s actually a really good book called the
    Culture Map. I am also currently reading a book called The 7 Habits of Highly
    Effective People. I also find it very interesting. I do have a lot of technical
    resources, not just “our” resources, let''s say from Analytics for Better World,
    but others as well. They could be interesting. I will share this across with you
    and maybe you can send it to your subscribers. I think it will be useful.'

- line: We will definitely include all the links for all the resources that we talked
    about in this interview (and I think there are quite a few of them) in the show
    notes, in the description. With that, I guess, we are a bit over time. Thanks
    a lot for joining us today, for sharing your experience and expertise with us.
    Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, for asking questions. It was fun. Thanks.
