short: Navigating Industrial Data Challenges
title: Navigating Industrial Data Challenges
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about industrial data challenges. We have a special guest
    today, Rosona. Rosona is a trained mathematician who works in the data space for
    the last six years, with the last three, working in industrial data. She is currently
    a machine learning engineer in a technical leadership role around synthetic tabular
    data in an AI innovation team. She's particularly intrigued by industrial R&D
    problems. Welcome to our event today, Rosona.

  who: Alexey
- line: "Thanks for the invitation. [chuckles] I'm glad that it finally worked out.\
    \ We've been trying to meet up\u2026 [cross-talk]"

  time: '1:57'
  who: Rosona
- line: It was a year or maybe more. It was always fun with you. Anyways, every time
    we spoke previously, you always had an opinion about many interesting topics.
    Today, we finally have a chance to put this on the record and have a podcast interview
    about that. The questions for today's interview are prepared by Johanna Bayer.
    Thanks a lot, Johanna, for your help.

  who: Alexey
- header: "Rosona\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go into our main topic of industrial data challenges, let's start
    with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 148
  time: '2:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I mean, you sort of gave the broad strokes, right? I was originally a PhD\
    \ mathematician. This is actually what brought me to Germany \u2013 an academic\
    \ career. I did several postdocs first in Hamburg. And you reach a point where\
    \ either it\u2019s gonna work or it's not [chuckles] relative to your constraints\
    \ in your life. So I decided, \u201COkay, industry it is.\u201D Then that's been\
    \ about six years. I've tried many roles. I sometimes tell people that looking\
    \ at my career path looks kind of like I'm a data Roomba, \u201CLet's try this.\
    \ I go in this direction, I hit a block, spin around.\u201D"
  sec: 158
  time: '2:38'
  who: Rosona
- line: Sorry, a data what?
  sec: 195
  time: '3:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: "A Roomba. You know those vacuum machines that you\u2026? You don't. A robot\
    \ \u2013 a robot that cleans your house. Except that makes me sound like I'm a\
    \ data cleaner by trade, which I'm not. But I mean, just like\u2026 there was\
    \ intention, which is more than I could say for a robot, I guess, or this particular\
    \ robot, but I explored a lot of things and each time, I pivoted. as someone on\
    \ LinkedIn was saying, \u201CHave a goal and then you have to keep pivoting.\u201D\
    \ Yeah, sure. But you should also adjust the goal as you go. Before you get into\
    \ industry, you don't really know what it means to be in industry. Anyway, a mixture\
    \ of things \u2013 financial data, CRM data, and then industrial data about three\
    \ years ago. A contract position for about nine months to a year and then where\
    \ I am now permanently."
  sec: 196
  time: '3:16'
  who: Rosona
- line: "I think industrial data is something that really frustrated me and why I\
    \ wanted to do this topic is \u2013 I feel like we're ignored by a lot of tools\
    \ and a lot of demos. You get kind of tired of being that person in the audience\
    \ being like, \u201CBut what about our use case?\u201D So I'm here to say, \u201C\
    We have all of these data. It's cool! We have great challenges. If you're looking\
    \ for a new area, or in the future, what might you do in industry, this is a great\
    \ place that I think is under-represented, maybe in the space of events.\u201D\
    \ Also, a caveat I have to say. I'm here as a private person. None of my opinions\
    \ are those of my employer. I will do my very best not to use profanity, but I\
    \ make no promises. [chuckles]"

  who: Rosona
- line: '[chuckles] What did you actually research as a mathematician?'
  sec: 296
  time: '4:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, I meant to have a prop. Can I get off camera and come back? Is that okay?
    Alright, I'll be right back.
  sec: 300
  time: '5:00'
  who: Rosona
- line: I'm really curious as to what happens next.
  sec: 314
  time: '5:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Originally it was going to be at my desk and I would have had this there.
    So I didn't plan for that part. This is the shortest answer [holds up 3D-printed
    plastic item].
  sec: 322
  time: '5:22'
  who: Rosona
- line: For those who do not see the video because we will also release it as audio-only,
    what is that?
  sec: 332
  time: '5:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I actually don't know. I was thinking more\u2026 [cross-talk]"
  sec: 337
  time: '5:37'
  who: Rosona
- line: Those who are seeing the video are also wondering. [laughs]
  sec: 339
  time: '5:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: These are 3D printed topological spaces. This is an inverted sphere. I think
    this might be a Mobius band, it might not.
  sec: 345
  time: '5:45'
  who: Rosona
- line: "It\u2019s a Mobius strip, right? [cross-talk]"
  sec: 351
  time: '5:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, I think so, but actually, I think it's like an equivalent, but it's\
    \ not actually the same. Geometrically it's different, but topologically it is.\
    \ So that's the long answer to the short answer of \u201CI was an algebraic topologist\u201D\
    . I was way off in the far\u2026 have you seen the XKCD where he's got applied\
    \ fields and he's got \u201Csociologist, scientist, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\
    \ engineers,\u201D and then way over here is mathematicians? If you did the same\
    \ graph, but inside of mathematics, I feel like topology, especially algebraic\
    \ topology, especially my sub- sub- sub-discipline, is similarly way off the deep\
    \ end. Like, \u201CHey, guys, we're over here!\u201D So it\u2019s the study of\
    \ spaces. Some people call it \u201Crubber sheet geometry\u201D. It was fun. I\
    \ liked it, I think."
  sec: 352
  time: '5:52'
  who: Rosona
- line: You were inverting spheres?
  sec: 401
  time: '6:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Inverting spheres. There you go. There is actually applied algebraic topology,\
    \ but that's not what I did. But if you're excited about things like this like,\
    \ \u201CHey, this sounds cool. What can I do?\u201D Maybe go that way. I can name\
    \ my first advisor, who was Rob Ghrist, who then changed to more pure discipline.\
    \ But he has a lot of cool presentations."
  sec: 402
  time: '6:42'
  who: Rosona
- header: How mathematics knowledge helps in industry
- line: So one of the skills you gained is that you know a lot of mathematics. What
    parts of these mathematics were actually useful for your industrial career?
  sec: 422
  time: '7:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Sorry. [laughs] This is not fair. Because it''s totally not a
    question. It''s also a little mean, I feel like. [chuckles]'
  sec: 434
  time: '7:14'
  who: Rosona
- line: '[laughs] I''m sorry. We can skip that one.'
  sec: 442
  time: '7:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No, no, no. It's fine. It's fine. It just reminds me. I had this interview\
    \ with a group of (I'm not gonna name the employer, obviously) but a group of\
    \ applied mathematicians. I came into this interview and they\u2019re like, \u201C\
    How did you end up in IT?\u201D Like, \u201COkay, hostile environment\u2026\u201D\
    \ [chuckles]"
  sec: 444
  time: '7:24'
  who: Rosona
- line: '[chuckles] Because I''m curious, it was probably very useful when you were
    picking up some basics of machine learning. But maybe not all of that, right?'
  sec: 459
  time: '7:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. But I think this is also a deeper question of \u201CHow is mathematics\
    \ useful?\u201D And \u201CWhat is mathematics?\u201D And I think most\u2026 [Alexey\
    \ chuckles] No, I'm dead serious. Give me a second to address this. I think most\
    \ of what we learned in school of mathematics isn't mathematics. And what really\
    \ is mathematics to me is thinking logically. What I bring\u2026 Really, another\
    \ question that I like better is \u201CWhat do you bring, as a pure mathematician,\
    \ into this space?\u201D And I think, in math, especially in pure math \u2013\
    \ in a really niche discipline, where people are not willing to repeat themselves,\
    \ you have one chance to learn something from someone. You're at a conference.\
    \ There's that fancy guy over there and you're like, \u201COh, my God! He wrote\
    \ this paper (or she wrote this paper). I need to talk to them.\u201D And you\
    \ have maybe 40 minutes of their time, if you're lucky. Probably 20. Maybe 10.\
    \ And you have to optimize, the thing I want to know and what questions to ask\
    \ and like, \u201CHave I answered these questions?\u201D"
  sec: 468
  time: '7:48'
  who: Rosona
- line: "These are really valuable skills. I think just going in and understanding\
    \ what questions to ask, how you learn enough about something to sort of keep\
    \ a model of it in your head, and then (here's the pure math part) say, \u201C\
    How is this going to break?\u201D Because this is the difference between a proof\
    \ and a simulation. When you try to prove things, you're actually not trying to\
    \ prove something. I'm not out there being, \u201CHere's my argument for why you\
    \ should vote this way.\u201D I'm out there trying to first see, \u201CWhy will\
    \ this fail?\u201D and then fill those holes. And that's incredibly valuable and\
    \ I think it\u2019s the biggest thing I bring as a pure mathematician. It\u2019\
    s this \u201Cproof\u201D viewpoint."
  sec: 468
  time: '7:48'
  who: Rosona
- line: How long did you actually do this for?
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Academics?
  sec: 569
  time: '9:29'
  who: Rosona
- line: Mathematics, yeah.
  sec: 570
  time: '9:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Oh. [chuckles thoughtfully]\_I mean\u2026 You mean from the point I decided\
    \ to study pure mathematics? That was like two years of undergrad plus seven years\
    \ of Master\u2019s plus PhD plus six years of postdoc."
  sec: 571
  time: '9:31'
  who: Rosona
- line: Okay. That's a lot of mathematics.
  sec: 587
  time: '9:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's a lot. This is a full career. I think this is also something that makes\
    \ it really difficult \u2013 jumping to the end of the talk to \u201CWhat is this\
    \ transition like?\u201D I think it's very\u2026 people don't know where to put\
    \ you because you're lopsided. You have this whole career in a completely separate\
    \ space. So you're senior. You're obviously senior. I mean, look at your age.\
    \ Look at how long you've been working. But you aren't senior in a business sense.\
    \ There are a lot of things you don't know, right? You come in and maybe you don't\
    \ know SQL or whatever. You can learn it, obviously. But you're this weird, lopsided\
    \ human that people have to figure out, \u201CHow do I deal with the development\
    \ of this person?\u201D"
  sec: 588
  time: '9:48'
  who: Rosona
- line: "Yeah. If you can invert a sphere, the SQL is like ten minutes, right? [Rosona\
    \ laughs] It\u2019s very easy to pick up."
  sec: 629
  time: '10:29'
  who: Alexey
- header: What is industrial data?
- line: Okay. So we actually wanted to talk about industrial data. So what is industrial
    data?
  sec: 637
  time: '10:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Let me first make a caveat that I really like this topic. I'm working on\
    \ this topic. But I think there are obviously people who are super experts on\
    \ this. So before I offend anybody, industrial data is not a monolith. I think\
    \ it's a great question, \u201CWhat is it?\u201D It's very broad. Let me say that\
    \ the simplest answer is \u201CA productive industry generates the data.\u201D"
  sec: 645
  time: '10:45'
  who: Rosona
- line: "That\u2019s pretty much everything, right?"
  sec: 671
  time: '11:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not really. [cross-talk] I find that CRM data does not fall into this. HR
    data does not fall into this. Obviously, we have this data.
  sec: 672
  time: '11:12'
  who: Rosona
- line: "Why doesn\u2019t it fall into this? There is a process that generates data\
    \ \u2013 somebody is hired and there's a new record."
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Sure, but it's not like I have a thing that I'm trying to make. I mean, in\
    \ industries like the chemical industry, or the semiconductor industry, or our\
    \ friends in the automobile industry \u2013 people who have a thing that they\
    \ sell at the end of the day."
  sec: 691
  time: '11:31'
  who: Rosona
- line: Like a physical thing or process or something like that?
  sec: 712
  time: '11:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: A physical thing that they produce.
  sec: 714
  time: '11:54'
  who: Rosona
- line: Not necessarily a program.
  sec: 715
  time: '11:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not a program, not a person, not recommendations on a website. An actual physical
    thing.
  sec: 717
  time: '11:57'
  who: Rosona
- line: So say I want to create blue paint, there is a process for creating the paint,
    and there is some data produced by this process. [Rosona agrees] And when you
    work with this data, this is industrial data. Right?
  sec: 726
  time: '12:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Right. And then within industrial data, I just want to\u2026 [audio cuts\
    \ out] R&D data, which is small. This is why there's this like, \u201COh, small\
    \ R&D data,\u201D because that's where I have historically been sitting. But I've\
    \ been sort of half. I've also done some of what I would call \u201Cthe productive\u201D\
    . So there's industrial R&D, where experiments can be very expensive, which is\
    \ why it's small data \u2013 because it's expensive. And then you develop a process\
    \ for a new product. And then there's something like a pseudo-plant where you\
    \ do this \u2013 you run the process with a lot of Q&C, a lot of stopping it,\
    \ adjusting things."
  sec: 743
  time: '12:23'
  who: Rosona
- line: Q&C?
  sec: 783
  time: '13:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: "QC. Quality control, where you stop it. Good call, I'm usually better about\
    \ abbreviations. Right. So you stop it, and you adjust it, and you're developing\
    \ the process of making the thing. Step one, \u201CHere's the formulation for\
    \ the thing.\u201D Step two, \u201CHow do we actually do it? And what information\
    \ do we need to record to make sure that it's produced at a good quality?\u201D\
    \ And then step three is \u201CWe've developed that process. We've got it live.\
    \ It's running.\u201D And then there are live quality controls that you have to\
    \ do like, \u201CThis machine has a part that welds and it needs to be replaced\
    \ regularly because it wears out. How often does it need to be replaced?\u201D\
    \ Sort of productive maintenance or planned maintenance kinds of tasks happen\
    \ there."
  sec: 786
  time: '13:06'
  who: Rosona
- line: "I would say there are broadly three large areas. Then within those, there\
    \ are all sorts of directions people can go. There's agricultural stuff, where\
    \ data is expensive because it just takes so long. You have to wait until corn\
    \ grows. [chuckles] Or toxicology \u2013 you have to kill a rat (it's kind of\
    \ expensive to kill animals) to measure the toxicology. I mean, there's a lot\
    \ of stuff, not even just R&D, but all over. There's a lot of directions."
  sec: 786
  time: '13:06'
  who: Rosona
- line: Just to summarize, there are three categories of industrial data. First are
    R&D experiments. These experiments are expensive, so we have very little data
    there. Then there is production data. That's the other side of the spectrum. And
    then the thing in between, I kind of missed. What was that?
  sec: 858
  time: '14:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I mean, I haven't worked with this myself. I just know it exists. This is\
    \ how people have explained it to me. I've worked on the two extremes. In the\
    \ middle is sort of a mock-up of a running process. In step one of your R&D, you've\
    \ started developing this process. Step two is maybe where you've built the sketch\
    \ of a plant. Your plant\u2019s there, but you need to\u2026 [cross-talk]"
  sec: 879
  time: '14:39'
  who: Rosona
- line: Like a proof of concept?
  sec: 901
  time: '15:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, like a POC. Instead of a whole giant warehouse, you build a room running
    this process and you're trying to fine-tune how this should work.
  sec: 902
  time: '15:02'
  who: Rosona
- header: Setting up an industrial process using blue paint
- line: "So if we take this example of blue paint, then the expensive experiment part\
    \ would be combining different chemicals to see that the shade of blue is the\
    \ right one. Then the mock-up could be like, \u201CHow can we combine it in a\
    \ more automatic way?\u201D [cross-talk]"
  sec: 910
  time: '15:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. Right. \u201CHow do we automate this process? How do we get the\
    \ right volume? How do we make sure that it's always this color blue?\u201D"
  sec: 930
  time: '15:30'
  who: Rosona
- line: "Uh-huh. And then production would be\u2026 [cross-talk]"
  sec: 936
  time: '15:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Because volume can affect the color of paint. Also, paint is\u2026 I mean,\
    \ color is a hard problem, as we all know. I've painted a few apartments. [chuckles]"
  sec: 937
  time: '15:37'
  who: Rosona
- line: "I don't know why I decided to use this example. I think maybe five or six\
    \ years ago, I interviewed with a company. It was a chemical company in a very\
    \ small German village. And that was the only company in that village. It was\
    \ a huge company \u2013 a huge chemical company. And they were doing paints."
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's a good example. There's a lot of cool stuff with paints. Actually, another\
    \ reason why it's expensive is that one of the standard tests you do with paints\
    \ is called the \u201CFlorida test\u201D. I think originally, it was like \u201C\
    We leave it out in Florida for 30 years.\u201D But obviously, that's way too long\
    \ for R&D length. So you paint some paint and you send it to Florida and you let\
    \ it sit there for I don't know how long. But this is one of those\u2026 paint\
    \ is a big application."
  sec: 968
  time: '16:08'
  who: Rosona
- line: "That's also an expensive experiment, right? If you live in Germany, sending\
    \ something to Florida\u2026 [cross-talk]"
  sec: 996
  time: '16:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Imagine \u2013 you have to ship it to Florida."
  sec: 999
  time: '16:39'
  who: Rosona
- line: '[chuckles] So Spain will not work, right? It has to be Florida?'
  sec: 1003
  time: '16:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No. There's something special. You can look it up. I encourage people in\
    \ the audience to look up the \u201CFlorida paint test\u201D or whatever. You\
    \ can see pictures of these huge fields. They explain it to you like \u201CThere\u2019\
    s a special tropical environment, blah, blah, blah.\u201D I don't know the technical\
    \ aspect. I just know that it exists and I was shocked."

  who: Rosona
- header: "Internet companies\u2019 data vs industrial data"
- line: "Okay. So we already discussed that industrial data is different from the\
    \ usual internet companies\u2019 data. So the main difference is that there is\
    \ a physical process that creates a physical thing, most of the time, in industrial\
    \ data. There is an assembly line that creates a car, right? While in usual internet\
    \ companies\u2019 data, it\u2019s like a person comes, clicks, and then there\
    \ is a recommendation and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s all virtual, right?"
  sec: 1023
  time: '17:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, and I think it's also hard to adjust what data you get once it's productive.\
    \ There's a lot of things that seem to surprise people and one of them is you\
    \ can have tons of data on the productive end. Processes are not designed with\
    \ data in mind, necessarily, which I think is a difference with CRM \u2013 you\
    \ run experiments, you can say, \u201CWhat information do I actually need about\
    \ my customers?\u201D You can adjust what information you're collecting very quickly.\
    \ In industry, you can't necessarily\u2026"
  sec: 1049
  time: '17:29'
  who: Rosona
- line: "If your plant\u2019s in another country, you first need to explain what it\
    \ is you want them to do. I mean, things like what sensors are available to you.\
    \ There are also issues where you might have a work floor where you've got a consistent\
    \ process, but you have machines from four different manufacturers and each machine\
    \ has different sensors and different positions. How much do you trust your model\
    \ that you're building with these? First, of course, you have to do cleaning,\

    \ I wish I had gotten you an answer beforehand. I did put on this document \u2013\
    \ there's this machine learning repository, which has a very realistic dataset\
    \ on sensors. It's from the semiconductor industry. You can go play with that,\
    \ if you want to build yourself into an anomaly detection model for whatever the\
    \ process is that they're modeling. [cross-talk]"

    version with transcripts and footnotes. If by then you find anything interesting,
    then please let us know and we will add this to the show notes. By the way, I
    just shared the link in the live chat and I'm going to put this in the description
    too.

    \ we mean just not academia? Or do we mean productive industry?"

    \ where the next academic position I could take would have been six months with\
    \ a possible renewal for an extra six months. Moving to another country, learning\
    \ another language. And I thought, \u201CYou know, I'm not\u2026 No.\u201D [laughs]\
    \ At that point, obviously, I needed to do something not in academia. And then\
    \ why I started where I started is \u2013 I applied for everything and I asked\
    \ everybody, \u201CDo you know people who are in industry?\u201D [chuckles] \u201C\
    Oh, yeah! I know this guy. Oh, yeah.\u201D I talked to him and it's over someone\

    \ ago it was the way the project was pitched to me, which was, \u201CHey, we're\
    \ effectively this little research group in industry and we have all these POCs.\
    \ We want someone to help us try to figure out how to take them and turn them\
    \ into productive product projects.\u201D And I thought that sounded really cool.\
    \ That's what got me into it. And like the people. I have to say, I hung out with\
    \ a lot of physicists in grad school. If you're listening \u2013 Hi. [laughs]\
    \ There's a lot of physicists and chemists. It's just a different worldview \u2013\
    \ the people that you end up interfacing with. And in data science as well, the\
    \ people touching the data and generating the data."

    \ people who worked on the shop floor were walking around in these ridiculous\
    \ shiny jumpsuits, because of something in the fabric that reduces the static.\
    \ So you know people just wear whatever, right? People show up in hiking clothes.\
    \ It\u2019s just very casual. It's much more about the work and the science. It's\
    \ very\u2026 the people. The people \u2013 that\u2019s the answer."

- line: I also guess that it depends on where you are geographically. When it comes
    to Germany, for example, if you're in Berlin, there are not so many companies
    in this kind of industry. You'll probably end up working for an internet company.

    down there. You have to get outside of Berlin itself. Yeah.

- line: Yeah. Well, I think that's all we have time for today. Thanks a lot. That
    was a really good discussion. I'm pretty hungry now after talking about peanuts
    and cakes. [laughs] I should probably go and eat something. Thanks again. And
    thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was nice talking to you.
