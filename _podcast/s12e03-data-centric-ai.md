transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about data-centric AI. We have a special guest today,
    Marysia. Marysia works as a lead data scientist at GoDataDriven. She has a strong
    interest in education and teaching, both as a part of your current role at GoDataDriven
    and also as a co-organizer of PyData Amsterdam and PyData Global. Welcome.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Thank you for having me.

  who: Marysia
- header: Marysia’s background
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks,
    Johanna, for your help. Before we go into our main topic of data-centric AI, let's
    start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 109
  time: '1:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. I started by studying artificial intelligence at the University
    of Amsterdam, I did both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s in artificial intelligence.
    My early career was focused on specifically applying deep learning on medical
    imaging, particularly early stage lung cancer detection in 3D CT scans. Within
    that domain, my focus was on geometric deep learning on the medical domain, which
    was also the topic of my Master thesis, supervised by Max Welling.
  sec: 123
  time: '2:03'
  who: Marysia
- line: After that, I transitioned into the role of data science educator at GoDataDriven,
    which meant that I taught and created courses on basically all things data science.
    Now I work as a lead data scientist at GoDataDriven. In addition to that, I organize
    meetups and conferences, mostly in and around Amsterdam, with PyData.
  sec: 123
  time: '2:03'
  who: Marysia
- line: What did you do as a data science educator? You said your responsibilities
    included creating courses?
  sec: 175
  time: '2:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 182
  time: '3:02'
  who: Marysia
- line: That's cool.
  sec: 183
  time: '3:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. At the GoDataDriven Academy, we teach a lot of courses on everything
    data science. Some are very generic, like an introduction to Python for data analysts,
    or an introduction to data science, for instance. But we also create a lot of
    courses very specifically targeted towards a specific audience. For instance,
    I created a deep learning NLP course, or an unsupervised learning course. Those
    are more detailed or more specific topics, and then gave me an opportunity to
    really dive into that topic and create exercises and assignments and material
    on that. That was really fun.
  sec: 184
  time: '3:04'
  who: Marysia
- line: I think I spoke with folks from your company – from GoDataDriven – at the
    recent PyData/PyCon in Berlin. As far as I remember, you're doing education and
    consultancy, right?
  sec: 219
  time: '3:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I was mostly a data science educator for about two years, but I strongly
    believe that you can't be a good teacher if you don't also have hands-on experience.
    When I do courses or when I teach courses I like to really tell a lot of anecdotes
    about my experiences and in my work, because it speaks more to the imagination
    of why we're doing this than just talking about the concepts.
  sec: 234
  time: '3:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: While I really enjoyed it, I do feel like after two years of mostly focusing
    on the educational side, I need some hands-on experience. Also I was really missing
    this decoding bit. So the ideal situation for me is to go do both trainings and
    education and also work as a data scientist and combine that.
  sec: 234
  time: '3:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: Do you still teach?
  sec: 279
  time: '4:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Occasionally, some courses but I'm more focused on my lead data science role.
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Marysia
- line: What do you do as a lead data scientist?
  sec: 288
  time: '4:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm with a company where I'm mostly focused on building a community of practice
    there. They just went through a transition in the way that they organize their
    teams. And I want to make sure that all the data scientists still communicate
    clearly with each other, get to exchange knowledge, but also increase the maturity
    level of the data science products that we produce. So it’s making sure that everyone
    is not just doing something on their own time, behind their own laptop, but bringing
    them together and making sure that we actually get to mature, well-functioning,
    monitored data science products.
  sec: 291
  time: '4:51'
  who: Marysia
- header: What data-centric AI is
- line: Now, this is such an interesting topic. [chuckles] I want to ask more about
    that – maybe at the end, if we run out of questions, because the main topic for
    today is actually data-centric AI. Maybe it's related to what you do right now
    – building a community of practice and improving maturity. So let's go back to
    data-centric AI. What is data-centric AI? Why do we need to care about this?
  sec: 324
  time: '5:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a good question. I did a whole talk at PyData London about this
    whole thing – answering this question. But basically, in short, the central idea
    behind data-centric AI is that the focus has to shift from Big Data to Good Data.
    So Andrew Ng says that having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient
    to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn. The reason why we
    call it data-centric AI is because it's in contrast to the model-centric approach
    that a lot of us are used to. Because in a model-centric AI, the focus is really
    on iterating on the model, which means that you create a baseline model, give
    it the data that you have, you evaluate the baseline, and then you go back to
    the model, you revisit the modeling pipeline, and you make adjustments there –
    you change the algorithm, you adjust the architecture in your neural network,
    tune your hyperparameters, maybe even just some of the data transformations, such
    as how you compute missing values, or augment your images.
  sec: 354
  time: '5:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: But the dataset is generally considered static. And the idea behind data-centric
    AI is that we shouldn't just iterate on the model, but we should iterate on the
    data as well. That means improving the quality of our data by relabeling mislabeled
    or ambiguous data points. But it can also mean gathering more data or more examples
    of specific classes or readjusting the train and validation split. So data-centric
    AI is essentially about focusing on your data rather than just focusing on your
    model. And the idea of that is, of course, new. I mean, I know that one of the
    first things that I was taught was “garbage in, garbage out”. That's always been
    the idea. But the thing is that I strongly believe that data-centric AI is particularly
    relevant now compared to, let's say for example, 10 years ago.
  sec: 354
  time: '5:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: It's like the hype around deep learning – deep Learning wasn't new in 2010,
    for instance. The ideas weren’t new – a perceptron, we know about perceptrons
    in the 50s. The backpropagation has been around since the 80s. Even the first
    convolutional networks were already around in the 90s. But somehow, deep learning
    really came to prominence since, let's say, about 2010 and onwards. And that's
    not because the ideas themselves were new, but because the ground had changed.
    We have large annotated datasets available, GPUs that became available, which
    meant that deep learning gained more traction. I believe that something similar
    is happening for data-centric AI.
  sec: 354
  time: '5:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: We've always known that data is important, but it's more important now, I
    believe, for two main reasons. First of all, because more and more problems are
    now being solved with deep learning, we are more often dealing with unstructured
    data, rather than structured, tabular data. So unstructured data like images or
    audio or texts, whereas for tabular data, it's easier to focus on the quality
    because you have descriptive statistics and you can easily create visualizations
    to investigate correlations between features. It's easier to explore your data.
    And it's also easier to get an idea of the data at hand before you start any modeling.
  sec: 354
  time: '5:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: After some proper exploratory data analysis, focusing on data quality is kind
    of a natural result of that. But this is remarkably more complicated when you
    get to unstructured data, because it's more difficult to get good insights of
    the data that you have at hand with unstructured data. You can sample a few images,
    but do you know for sure that your data is good and representative? So because
    we're dealing with unstructured data now more than ever, we are more in need of
    tooling and techniques to help us out with that.
  sec: 354
  time: '5:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: It's a bit counterintuitive to me, that we need this data-centric AI now more
    than 10 years ago, because it seems like 10 years ago, when we didn't have all
    these GPUs, we needed to be smart about how we approached things. Then it mattered
    like what kind of data we have. But now it’s just “take a cluster of GPUs, throw
    in more data, and sit back and wait till magically becomes better.” It doesn't
    work like that, does it?
  sec: 596
  time: '9:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, unfortunately, not. There's this persistent idea that the quantity of
    the data will compensate for the quality. So if your data quality is not good,
    just gather 1000 more examples, and that's fine. But I think something really
    changed because we're more than ever making use of transfer maps. If you have
    to train a neural network all the way from scratch, then yes, more data is probably
    a good way to go. But nowadays, we have large foundation models and we are mostly
    focused on fine-tuning those. Because, as an individual data scientist, I don't
    have the resources to compete with something like GPT-3, so I fine-tune it to
    my own problems.
  sec: 628
  time: '10:28'
  who: Marysia
- line: When you're fine-tuning, that's the situation where the model has already
    learned a lot about the structure of images, the structure of texts – if you want
    to fine tune it to your specific problem. If in that situation, you are giving
    it examples that aren't right, then it's basically fine-tuning on the wrong thing.
    I think that's one of those cases where the data matters more – the quality of
    the data matters more – and it's also one of the cases where we, as data scientists,
    can have a bigger impact. Because I'm not going to adjust the architecture or
    the parameters of a large model that is provided to me (a foundation model) but
    I know about my data – I know about my use case – and I can focus on the data
    more than I can focus on the model itself.
  sec: 628
  time: '10:28'
  who: Marysia
- header: Data-centric Kaggle competitions
- line: 'I''ll try to recap everything you said – maybe not everything, but the main
    idea. So we have two approaches: the data-centric approach and the model-centric
    approach. In the model-centric approach, the dataset is static and you iterate
    on the model, maybe tune the model, change parameters, try different architectures,
    you make some adjustments, and you might also do some feature engineering. But
    the dataset – the images or the rows of your dataset remain the same. In contrast
    to that, in the data-centric approach, you change the data instead of changing
    the model – or in addition to changing the model.'
  sec: 718
  time: '11:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: You also look at the data, you see the bad examples, you see the good examples,
    you see where you can improve the data – instead of focusing on the model, you
    put more effort, more emphasis, on the data part. Right? [Marysia agrees] I think
    that this model-centric approach is very typical for a Kaggle competition. [Marysia
    agrees] In a Kaggle competition, you have trained .CSV file, and then you have
    a test.CSV file, and that's all you’ve got. You, of course, have some room for
    experiments. You can tune your XGBoost model, you can train as many models as
    possible, you can put all of them together in an ensemble, but it's a model-centric
    approach because you're tuning the knobs of the model.
  sec: 718
  time: '11:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: The data-centric approach is different. The reason I spoke about Kaggle, because
    I also heard there are competitions about data-centric AI. To my knowledge, you
    even took part in one or even in multiple competitions. [Marysia confirms] Can
    you maybe tell us about these competitions?
  sec: 718
  time: '11:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. Of course, I took part in multiple Kaggle competitions, as many
    data scientists have. I really recognize what you're saying – that usually, you
    have your data and you don't go about gathering more data. It's more about the
    model itself. But as a contrast to that, we have the data-centric AI competition
    that I participated in with two of my colleagues, Rens Dimmendaal and Roel Bertens.
    The data-centric AI competition was a competition hosted by DeepLearning.ai that
    ran for six weeks in September 2021. And the central idea behind this competition
    was that the model was fixed and the data could be changed. The task was about
    classifying images of Roman numerals – handwritten Roman numerals.
  sec: 825
  time: '13:45'
  who: Marysia
- line: We were initially provided with a dataset of 3000 images, divided into a certain
    train and validation split. It was up to us to submit the data and all the compute
    was handled on the chance side. The model was a fixed ResNet 50. We could submit
    up to 10,000 images, so there was a cap there. We couldn't just say “Let's just
    get a huge quantity of data.”
  sec: 825
  time: '13:45'
  who: Marysia
- line: That's smart to do this limit, right? [chuckles] Because you can just generate
    so many images and overload the system with this.
  sec: 897
  time: '14:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. There was a cap on that. One of the things that I really liked about
    that, besides introducing me to this idea of data-centric AI, was that it made
    participating very accessible. It was a deep learning challenge, because it was
    an image challenge, but you didn't need any beefy GPUs because all the computers
    handled it for you.
  sec: 905
  time: '15:05'
  who: Marysia
- line: That means that anyone with about 10 MB of storage space and an internet connection
    could participate. Like I said, I participated with my colleagues Rens Dimmendaal
    and Roel Bertens and we ended up winning in the Most Innovative category and presenting
    a solution at the data-centric AI workshop at NeurIPS alongside the other winners.
  sec: 905
  time: '15:05'
  who: Marysia
- line: That's pretty great. Was it your first exposure to this idea of data-centric
    AI?
  sec: 947
  time: '15:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's an interesting question. It was my first exposure to the concept.
    I've not heard of data-centric AI before. But my one major competition that I
    participated in before was also a Kaggle competition. That was the Data Science
    Bowl, where we participated in detecting whether someone had lung cancer or not
    based on CT images. That wasn't a data-centric AI competition (we ended up in
    third place with the company that I was with at the time) but it turned out that
    all the top three solutions really didn't use the data that was provided by Kaggle
    whatsoever.
  sec: 952
  time: '15:52'
  who: Marysia
- line: The second solution, by Julian DeWitt was all focused on creating a system
    so he could easily evaluate whether the scans or the data that he had was any
    good, and making selections based on that, and creating a tool that allowed him
    to easily annotate additional information, which made it easier for him to get
    to that second place solution. So while that wasn't named as a data-centric AI
    competition, it was very interesting to me that all the top solutions ignored
    the data that we were provided with and decided to focus on gathering additional
    data, creating a model in a completely different way, based on the data that we
    did think was more useful. So it was kind of data-centric in that sense, as well.
  sec: 952
  time: '15:52'
  who: Marysia
- line: You just didn't know it was called “data-centric”.
  sec: 1040
  time: '17:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly.
  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Marysia
- line: It's pretty typical for Kaggle competitions, I think, to use external data.
    You have to disclose that you use this particular dataset. But I guess it gives
    you an edge in image competitions when there is an external dataset that you can
    use to make your model better.
  sec: 1044
  time: '17:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I agree with that. But I also think that there's a difference between
    simply gathering more data, and for instance, what some of the winning approaches
    were based on – focusing on finding out what the most useful data to add was.
    Like, “What things were we missing in our data? What things weren't we missing?
    Which examples had to have a higher weight because they were more important than
    other data samples?” Those kinds of decisions about your data, which I think goes
    a bit further than just getting some extra images.
  sec: 1064
  time: '17:44'
  who: Marysia
- line: This is a nice answer to the question, “Why should they take part in data
    science competitions?” You might stumble into an idea. For you, you said it was
    September 2021, so not so long ago. But now, you're given talks about data-centric
    AI, you're talking on a podcast about that and you also won this Most Innovative
    Approach award. I guess your life has changed a little bit after taking part in
    that competition.
  sec: 1097
  time: '18:17'
  who: Alexey
- header: The mindset shift to data-centric AI
- line: Yes. I think data-centric AI for me is – when we talk about something like
    this, it's very often focused on the tools and the methods like, “How do we do
    something like this? What kind of packages do you use? What kind of tools?” But
    for me, the most important thing was a mindset shift. Focusing on the data and
    not seeing the dataset’s aesthetic has really helped me throughout my career since
    that moment, because I think that's a very important insight – that, yes, this
    may be the data that I have, but I can also make decisions about that and change
    it throughout my modeling process.
  sec: 1126
  time: '18:46'
  who: Marysia
- line: Yeah, that's interesting. The point about changing – earlier today, you mentioned
    that your train/validation split also doesn't have to be static. Right? [Marysia
    agrees] Immediately I thought, “But wait, if our validation set is not static,
    how do we compare two approaches and say that one approach is better than the
    other if our validation set isn't consistent – if we change it between two runs?”
    You see what I mean?
  sec: 1164
  time: '19:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let's say you have two models, usually the easiest way to compare these two
    models is to evaluate these models on the same validation dataset and whatever
    model gets the higher score is better. [Marysia agrees] But the moment we change
    the validation dataset, we cannot compare these models because they are evaluated
    on different datasets. [Marysia agrees] For me, it got me thinking, “Okay, if
    we start changing the validation dataset, how can we be sure that it's actually
    an improvement?”
  sec: 1164
  time: '19:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that's a very valid question. First of all, when we were participating
    in the data-centric AI competition, I think that our insight that the train and
    validation split that we were provided with wasn't a good split for us – our validation
    set turned out to be not very representative of all of the data. There was a huge
    part of the data that was not represented in the validation set that was represented
    in the train set, so we decided to rebalance that. In our case, in the data-centric
    AI competition, we didn't have access to an actual test set, because that was
    handled on the competition side. So there was another holdout set that we were
    eventually evaluated on. The validation set in this case was used in order to
    determine when we were done training – for early stopping was when it was used.
    In that sense, it still matters.
  sec: 1226
  time: '20:26'
  who: Marysia
- line: I have a very technical background with artificial intelligence – I like to
    focus on the numbers. But I do also believe that we shouldn't only focus on the
    number of the metric. Sometimes you can make a change to your test set to your
    validation set, which makes the numbers go down, but gives you more confidence
    that that number is correct. If you notice that, for instance, in your test set
    or your validation set, the thing that you eventually validate on is missing a
    part of the data that you do expect to encounter in practice – do you not add
    that data to your test set, because you're no longer able to compare the bundles?
    Do you not add it because your metric will go down? I think it's better to change
    it but be confident about the change that you have made. That makes it more trustworthy
    regarding what your eventual results will be.
  sec: 1226
  time: '20:26'
  who: Marysia
- line: Then at the end, you can just re-evaluate all this. I know we're talking about
    the data-centric approach, not model-centric. But then at the end, if you change
    your validation dataset you can just reevaluate your approaches on the new split
    – on the new validation.
  sec: 1333
  time: '22:13'
  who: Alexey
- header: Data-centric does not mean you should not iterate on models
- line: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I also want to emphasize, of course, that data-centric
    AI doesn't mean that we shouldn't change the model. [chuckles] I think it's often
    named in contrast to model-centric AI. But for me, data-centric AI means that
    we iterate on both the model and the data. So yes, it doesn't mean that I just
    take a baseline and never change my model anymore, because in practice, that won't
    get me the best results. But I do think that very often, there's more to get from
    improvements on the data than, for instance, changing the entropy in your decision
    tree to a tuning.
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Marysia
- header: How to implement the data-centric approach
- line: Right. You said that for you, the most important realization was the mindset
    shift from not just how we do this, but also that the dataset is not a static
    thing and you can change it. But I'm still wondering, how do we actually do this?
    What are the tools? What are the approaches for that? How do we implement this?
  sec: 1382
  time: '23:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a very good question. So there's not one toolbox that I can recommend
    that has everything. I think it's a very broad subject. It's also what you focus
    on. There are a lot of tools out there that can help you with labeling, or finding
    the data points in your data that need labeling. But of course, there are different
    tools for text-based or image-based or audio-based. But there's way more to data-centric
    AI than just relabeling. There are also tools for, for instance, generating synthetic
    data. How do you create good synthetic data to augment your current dataset?
  sec: 1404
  time: '23:24'
  who: Marysia
- line: There's a very broad spectrum of things that are all data related. And there's
    also a lot of development at the moment being done on these tools. Because I think
    that at the moment, we all experience, especially working with financial models,
    working with unstructured data – we experience a need for tools that help us out
    with these kinds of things. A lot is currently being developed – a lot of high
    tech tools, a lot of low tech tools as well. I'm personally a big fan of not using
    one thing and having everything work out of the box. I wouldn't like a magic “fix
    all your bad labels” tool if there was one, because I think that my value as a
    data scientist is in understanding the data and talking with subject matter experts.
    I like to have a lot of control over that process.
  sec: 1404
  time: '23:24'
  who: Marysia
- line: I think the most important lesson that we learned is that, at the end, it's
    not about what tools you use, it's about how easy you make it for yourself to
    iterate on the data and how you keep track of that. That could mean that you use
    DVC to version your data and you have a good overview of all the datasets that
    you've used. But in our case, for the data-centric AI competition, we were still
    naming things with “_v3” which maybe wasn't the nicest versioning approach, but
    it was easy for us to re-label our data and that was a very important thing. That
    wasn't a bottleneck.
  sec: 1404
  time: '23:24'
  who: Marysia

    DataTalks.Club, we recently launched a competition. This competition is about
    classifying images of different kinds of kitchen stuff – be it a plate, cup, glass,
    fork, spoon, and so on.

  who: Marysia
- line: Yeah. It was terrible. [laughs] Maybe for the next one, I'll use something
    like one of the tools that you mentioned, like DVC, or something else. Because
    at the end it was really hard to keep track of what was changed between like these
    1000s of folders.
  sec: 1569
  time: '26:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's the same thing – when I started out as a data scientist, when I
    was trying out different hyperparameters, we'd be writing things on a post-it
    note next to my laptop. [chuckles] There's a better way to track your experiments
    than just writing everything on a post it note. I think the same goes for your
    data, probably. So that's the first thing, but also just changing your data. I
    think that's an important thing. For a lot of people, it's difficult to do because
    there's a whole mindset – it's considered static.
  sec: 1586
  time: '26:26'
  who: Marysia
- line: One of the things that made it really easy for us during the data-centric
    AI competition, was that when we basically started labeling in Google Docs, we
    found out that when you have the URL of an image, you see the image itself, so
    we could very easily change the label that was associated with it, and then turn
    it back into a pandas data frame. And then we could do some magic scripts so that
    every file will be in the right folder. It took a bit of time to create those
    scripts, but it made all of the other work a lot easier for us in the long run
    – to adjust things. I think that's an important one. Make it easy to make adjustments.
  sec: 1586
  time: '26:26'
  who: Marysia
- line: So the process you had – you had a Google spreadsheet with one column with
    the URL and other column was class, right? [Marysia agrees] Then you could just
    go there and change a label, or multiple labels, and then you had a script that
    would pull data from this Google spreadsheet and train a model. Then it would
    say, “Okay, for this version of the spreadsheet, this is the score you have.”
  sec: 1648
  time: '27:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. We also had some little tricks to make it easier for us to
    work with the spreadsheet, because again, there were 3000 images. So that means
    that you have 3000 rows. We did things like, which was relatively easy to do,
    put the data through the model, already get some predictions, and then order the
    data points on confidence of the model, for instance. Or we made extensive use
    of the embeddings, visualizing the embeddings, and seeing that some data points
    were very far away from the distribution of that class. Then that's one of those
    data points that you pay attention to. We made use of little tricks like that
    to filter on what to focus our attention on.
  sec: 1675

    Warmerdam. I think he's really into these tools that help you with finding bad
    data, right?
  sec: 1717
  time: '28:37'
  who: Alexey

    labeling – a lot of tricks – which was a really good talk that I recommend.

  who: Marysia
- header: Focusing on the data vs focusing on the model
- line: You said the most important thing is focusing on the approach, how you iterate
    over this, and how you make it easier for you to iterate, instead of focusing
    on high tech and low tech tools. I guess the low tech tool that you used in your
    competition was Google Spreadsheets. But I'm really curious about the approach
    that you took.
  sec: 1742
  time: '29:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: How would you actually implement this in practice? Let's say you join an organization
    as a consultant, or maybe as an in-house data scientist and you want to follow
    this data-centric AI approach. How would you structure your project? What kind
    of tools would you use to make it easier to implement all the things we discussed?
  sec: 1742
  time: '29:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a good question. I don't think I have a specific answer on what tools
    I would use. But I think that’s mostly because I don't feel strongly about certain
    tools over others. I'm more interested in the process. I think one of the most
    important changes that I would make and have made in the organization that I'm
    with, is that one of the most important lessons that I learned from the data center
    AI competition is that data is easier to talk about than the model is. It's very
    hard to go to subject matter experts and talk about your results and say, “Well,
    I used weight normalization instead of batch normalization.” That's not a very
    viable conversation. But you can show examples of the data. You can talk about
    the data.
  sec: 1795
  time: '29:55'
  who: Marysia
- line: You can talk about the odd examples that you find and go to someone who knows
    more about the source of the data that can explain things to you. I think this
    was particularly relevant when I worked in a medical imaging company where we
    actually had a doctor employed, who, whenever I found odd things in the data,
    I could go and talk to him, show him, and he would explain things to me, which
    would really adjust the way that I approached the modeling as well.
  sec: 1795
  time: '29:55'
  who: Marysia
- line: I wouldn't have any specific tools to recommend. But I would recommend having
    a very close connection to the person who knows more about the data and realize
    that if you get the same performance, but by changing the data, or by changing
    the model – by changing the data, it's much easier to collaborate. It's also much
    easier for the person who you're presenting the model or the end result to, to
    have a bit of faith that it's working correctly, rather than just an abstract
    metric.
  sec: 1795
  time: '29:55'
  who: Marysia
- header: Resources to help implement the data-centric approach
- line: I guess what I wanted to hear from you was more tactical. For me, what you’re
    saying sounds like a strategy, “You need to be close with subject matter experts,”
    which is super valid, but I'm still wondering, how do I actually make it happen?
    I have a project, I have a bunch of subject matter experts, and I have a dataset.
    I want to make sure that I don't go crazy, that I don't have like 1000 folders
    with names like “new_v2_Kaggle_final” and so on. How do I make that happen? How
    do I organize this? Do you have any tips and tricks or best practices or talks
    that I should check out or anything like that?
  sec: 1894
  time: '31:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The reason why I find it very difficult to give an answer to this is
    because I think there's a lot of great tools out there. But there's two resources
    that I find very useful. One is by Haiti Research, and one is by WhyData. They
    have a really good overview of awesome data-centric AI tools that are structured
    in a way, “Is it about profiling? Is it about synthetic data? Are you working
    with images? Are you working with text?” Because the tools are very specific to
    that.
  sec: 1942
  time: '32:22'
  who: Marysia
- line: Those are two resources that I would recommend to look for the right tools
    for the use case that you're working with. I would, as a data scientist, still
    start with a model-centric approach. I would still create a baseline as a model,
    but then use those model results to not only go back to the model and how to adjust
    those hyperparameters, but also use the results of that to see if there's any
    gaps in my data that I'm seeing.
  sec: 1942
  time: '32:22'
  who: Marysia
- line: It's basically doing error analysis and understanding where the model was
    wrong. [Marysia confirms] And then trying to understand why the model was wrong
    and talk to people who know data well to figure this out. Because maybe for you
    alone, it could be difficult to understand why, for this particular dataset, this
    was the final label or these were the predictions. It helps to talk to subject
    matter experts to figure this out and conclude that maybe the label on this example
    is actually not right and it should be a different one. [Marysia confirms]
  sec: 1996
  time: '33:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. This is what the process looks like, right? You train a model, you analyze
    the errors, you analyze the mistakes of the model, you talk to subject matter
    experts, and you iterate, iterate, iterate until the model is good enough.
  sec: 1996
  time: '33:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, basically.
  sec: 2051
  time: '34:11'
  who: Marysia
- line: Sounds simpler than I thought. [chuckles]
  sec: 2053
  time: '34:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's always important in these kinds of things to keep humans in the
    loop. And that could be subject matter experts but it could also be just the data
    scientists who've learned, obviously, a lot about data as well and knows what
    they're doing. I'm not a big fan of the type of tools that automate everything
    away. I know there's a lot of optimization going on that can help us, but always
    keep a human in the loop to be sure that you can truly trust your results.
  sec: 2056
  time: '34:16'
  who: Marysia
- header: Data-centric AI vs standard data cleaning
- line: I must admit it sounds terribly similar to “standard” data cleaning. You have
    errors, then you go to the dataset and you see, “Okay, this row doesn't make sense.
    This is an outlier, so I’ll just throw it away.” And then maybe you even have
    a rule, “If this value in this feature in this column is two sigmas away from
    the mean, then you just throw it away, or you add it (or whatever),” which is
    a pretty standard data cleaning step, probably. What's the difference between
    these two approaches, or is data cleaning the same as a data-centric approach?
  sec: 2082
  time: '34:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think data cleaning is a part of data-centric AI. But then data-centric
    AI itself is more broad. It's easiest, I guess, to talk about data-centric AI
    in terms of “What is a good label and what is a bad label?” Or “How do you choose
    to deal with your missing values?” But it's a lot broader than that. It's also,
    for instance, about (what I think is a very important thing) “What is my dataset
    representative and is there any bias in that? Is my dataset complete?” Those are
    not things that are typically part of data cleaning. There are tools being developed,
    for instance, for images to see if you have a representative dataset – if you
    have a complete dataset – and those tools can really help there as well.
  sec: 2124
  time: '35:24'
  who: Marysia
- header: Making sure your data is representative
- line: How do we actually check that? I'm really curious. I have a dataset now with
    spoons, forks, cups, glasses, etc. How do I know if it's complete?
  sec: 2164
  time: '36:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that's a good question. [chuckles] I think it's very hard to know without
    any domain knowledge. For example, a toy project that I did once was classifying
    penguins – classifying penguin species based on images – and I sourced the dataset,
    basically, just through downloading all the Google image results. Of course, lots
    of the data is right, there's a few mistakes in there and it was easy to focus
    on getting those bad labels out of there and re-labeling those. But I think that's
    one of those cases where it's very easy. I mean, if there's one thing that’s classified
    wrong, maybe we can gather a bit more data, and that kind of overcompensates for
    that.
  sec: 2174
  time: '36:14'
  who: Marysia
- line: To make sure that it was representative in that particular case, I thought
    about “What situations are there where I can encounter penguins? They can be on
    land, they can be in the snow, but they can also be on water, for instance. And
    I need to have groups of penguins, and I need to have individual penguins, and
    I need to have penguins from the side and maybe not necessarily from the top.”
    So all the things that I can encounter. I noticed just by going through my data
    that I was missing a lot. I didn't have a lot of examples of baby penguins for
    different species, for instance. So that was one of those examples where my dataset
    was not complete. Of course, this is something that I could have figured out by
    just scrolling through all the images and noticing this. But in this particular
    case, I came up with the different things that I thought I should have in my images
    and I decided to visualize the embeddings of my images.
  sec: 2174
  time: '36:14'
  who: Marysia
- line: I basically put my data through a neural network that was already trained,
    that didn't take the head of it. But I took the embeddings and I reduced the dimensionality
    to UMap. With UMap I can visualize it and I use an interactive tool to be able
    to view my images. And I saw different clusters of types of images because, of
    course, all the penguins in the water were kind of together in terms of embeddings
    and all the on land were kind of together. I used that interactive tool to get
    a bigger insight into my data. Then I noticed “Yes, I did see a few baby penguins,”
    but I didn't see a lot of data points around those. There were only three in my
    datasets.
  sec: 2174
  time: '36:14'
  who: Marysia
- line: I think that's one of those cases where, yeah, it's part of my data gathering
    process, but I did think about this upfront, I didn't think about “What kinds
    of things can I encounter and do I see these in my datasets?” I didn't want to
    manually go through the images because that would take a lot of time, so I used
    a neat little trick of visualizing the embeddings to make that process easier
    for myself. Then I gathered more data by Googling the type of penguin and then
    the word “baby” after it. That's how I gathered more data and the right category.
  sec: 2174
  time: '36:14'
  who: Marysia
- line: I think one of the tools that we can potentially use is a tool from Vincent,
    which is called Embetter, right?
  sec: 2358
  time: '39:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s really cool. I actually did this project before I knew about Embetter,
    so I would really like to try it out again, whether that makes my life a bit easier.
  sec: 2376
  time: '39:36'
  who: Marysia
- line: For anyone who is watching this right now or listening to this, there is a
    video from Vincent on our channel. It was published this week, I think. It's called
    “Open Source Spotlight” and “Better in Bulk”. So Vincent built two tools. I'm
    really amazed by how he turns his ideas into these small little projects and then
    just publishes them in open source. So the approach for you is – you need to think
    about all the situations where it's possible to encounter a penguin or, if we
    generalize, all the contexts, all the situations where we can see the objects
    were detecting (understanding) and then see if we miss anything.
  sec: 2386
  time: '39:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, if I go back to the dataset with cups and glasses, perhaps I
    need to think about the conditions, like the light conditions, because I need
    to have images that are well-lit, when it's dark, when it's bright. Then there
    are different angles – sometimes maybe in some situations, I see the handle of
    a cup in some situations head on. So it's just sitting and thinking – maybe taking
    notes.
  sec: 2386
  time: '39:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. And I think it's important that you do this at the start of your process,
    when you first gather the data. But this can also be part of your error analysis.
    When you see that your model is specifically making mistakes on cups where you
    can't see the handle, that might be a reason for you to think, “Okay, maybe I
    need to gather a bit more of that data and verify that hypothesis.” So that's
    a hypothesis that you can make, “Why is my model having trouble with this particular
    image?” Verify that with your initial data source, see if you can gather more
    data, and then have a new version of your dataset and try, let's say, exactly
    the same model again and see if it works better now.
  sec: 2470
  time: '41:10'
  who: Marysia

- line: And when do we stop? How do we know if it's good enough?
  sec: 2507
  time: '41:47'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 2510
  time: '41:50'
  who: Marysia
- line: It depends, right? [chuckles]
  sec: 2513
  time: '41:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends. [chuckles] When your results are good enough for your usage. How
    much time you have also matters. For instance, it did for me when I was doing
    the penguin project, because I was just sourcing images through Google, it was
    very easy to just Google, “baby penguins”, “addley penguins”. It was very easy
    to gather more data. But if you have to actually go out there to your kitchen
    and photograph a bunch of additional pictures of all your cups, that does make
    it a little bit more complicated. So when is it good enough? Given the time that
    you have and given the project that you have, if your results are satisfactory.
    And that can be because of model tuning, but that could also be because of data
    tuning.
  sec: 2514
  time: '41:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: Then I guess, talk to subject matter experts, stakeholders, and ask them what
    they think. Is this 80% accuracy satisfactory or do you need more?”
  sec: 2555
  time: '42:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Though, in my experience, that's also always a very difficult conversation
    to have because when you just talk about metrics, to lots of people, it's just
    a random number. “80% sounds nice. Highest number is best.” So that's always a
    very difficult conversation, in my experience, to have. But you can give examples
    of your data as well, like “These are the data points that it classifies correctly.
    And these are the ones that it still has some troubles with. Is that okay for
    you?”
  sec: 2567
  time: '42:47'
  who: Marysia
- line: Okay. I think you've been advocating for this throughout the entire interview,
    “Don't focus on metrics.” Right? [chuckles] “Focus on data.”
  sec: 2595
  time: '43:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I guess so. Yes.
  sec: 2604
  time: '43:24'
  who: Marysia
- line: So it means “Okay, if I know that my model is making mistakes when it's dark
    (there is not enough light) I can just talk to my stakeholders and show them.
    ‘Okay, there's a picture of a fork, but the lights are turned off. That's why
    the model thinks it's a glass. Are you okay with this? Or do we need to collect
    enough pictures of forks in complete darkness, and then the model will be better.
    ’” This is the approach you will take? [Marysia agrees] Okay, cool. Interesting.
  sec: 2605
  time: '43:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that's also because of my background in the medical field, where we
    were doing deep learning, but explainability was very important because trust
    in the system was a very important thing. You don't gain trust by just showing
    a graph or just showing a metric.
  sec: 2637
  time: '43:57'
  who: Marysia
- header: The importance of user feedback
- line: Another thing that occurred to me while we were talking is that we can take
    this a simple model, and if our conditions allow – maybe for the medical field,
    it's not good enough, but if it's a simple thing classification – we can just
    deploy our model and see how users play with this and collect feedback from the
    users.
  sec: 2653
  time: '44:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let's say if we want to deploy… There was a project I did a couple of years
    ago, which was about classifying garbage types. In many European countries garbage
    of a certain type needs to go to a bin of a certain type. In Germany, you put
    plastic in the yellow bin, and you put paper in the blue bin. I don't know how
    it is in the Netherlands – probably something similar.
  sec: 2653
  time: '44:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I heard the municipality of Amsterdam is doing very similar projects
    where they send around cars to notice the garbage on the street and notify the
    right people to pick it up.
  sec: 2702
  time: '45:02'
  who: Marysia
- line: And then you have this model. You can create an app and then see what kind
    of things users send and see if there are any mistakes there. For example, if
    the model says that paper should go to the black bin, which is for everything
    else that doesn't fit the other bins, maybe you can try to understand why the
    model is making these mistakes. “What kind of things are we missing? And is it
    because our dataset is wrong? Or is it because our model is not so good? How can
    we fix this problem?” Then probably the reason for that is data.
  sec: 2712
  time: '45:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Very often it is, yeah. I think an important part of data-centric AI is focusing
    on the data. It’s also about how you actually label your data. How do you know
    that it's good? Exactly what you just said – collecting user feedback can be a
    very, very good way to get more knowledge about the data that you have.
  sec: 2752
  time: '45:52'
  who: Marysia
- line: Is this a typical approach of how we put this in production? Maybe there are
    other approaches? We just roll it out and see how users react? I guess if we talk
    about the medical field, we cannot just deploy this model to lung cancer things
    and then let people just use it and correct data later. It's simply not applicable.
    There, we need to use a different approach. In the case of garbage classification,
    it's okay if one piece of paper will end up in the wrong bin.
  sec: 2775
  time: '46:15'
  who: Alexey
- header: “Shadow Mode” deployment
- line: Yeah. That's actually interesting, because we did do this with the medical
    imaging software. We actually did deploy it in hospitals but, of course, not very
    broadly. It was first with a few people who were interested, and they volunteered
    – these radiologists volunteered to have our software run next to their day-to-day
    job. So they were still responsible for judging scans, the software was not making
    any decisions. I think that's a very important thing when you're still developing.
    But they did see the model results of the software and we talked to them extensively
    about the feedback. We got a lot of feedback, for instance, that certain mistakes
    were being made, or certain types of mistakes were being made. That point already
    led us to gather more data of those kinds of examples.
  sec: 2812
  time: '46:52'
  who: Marysia
- line: I think that's called “Shadow Mode” deployment or something like that. You
    deploy this thing in addition to whatever process is there and then you just use
    this to collect data. Then you compare whatever decision the model is making with
    the decision of the subject matter expert, in this case a doctor. Then you see
    where the model is wrong and where it's right.
  sec: 2864
  time: '47:44'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 2885

  who: Marysia

    which is an online classifieds site – a place for selling second hand stuff. In
    the Netherlands I think you have Marktplaats. [Marysia agrees] So it’s similar
    to that. In one of the projects, we just let it run in parallel to moderators
    and then we compared the output of moderators with the output of the model and
    we concluded that the model is good enough. There were, of course, some issues,
    but after one or two iterations, we concluded that it's good enough. Interesting.
    I was asking you about that. [chuckles] How do you know if it's good enough? For
    us, it was talking to these moderators and thinking, “Do you think it will help
    you or not?”
  sec: 2886

    you can't collect new good data, and you can't re-label the data, I guess you
    could do a lot of manual work to make your bad data a little bit less bad? But
    if you don't have enough data, then some problems just aren't solvable.
  sec: 2959

  who: Marysia
- line: At some point, I was talking to someone who offered me a project and said,
    “Yeah, also, I want you to classify 13 different classes, but I have 54 examples.
    Also, it's 3D images.” That’s just not going to work. [chuckles] Unfortunately,
    there's not a clear-cut answer there. If you have a lot of bad data, it might
    require a lot of manual work to make it good data, but if you don't have enough
    still, then it's unfortunately not a feasible project.
  sec: 2959
  time: '49:19'
  who: Marysia
- line: Okay, so you might even need to open your favorite image editor and edit some
    of the data, right?
  sec: 3007
  time: '50:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe, but I wouldn't be very enthusiastic about the project, if that's what
    I ended up doing. [Alexey laughs] I studied artificial intelligence because I
    find this whole topic, this whole field, very interesting. I do try to automate
    those things away, because if I ended up just doing data cleaning by opening image
    editors and removing stuff there, I don't think that's the reason I got into this
    job in the first place.
  sec: 3016
  time: '50:16'
  who: Marysia
- line: So maybe it's better to have a model that is doing the editing, right?
  sec: 3041
  time: '50:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: That would be really nice, yes. Or tools that can help you out to automate
    a lot of this stuff away.
  sec: 3045
  time: '50:45'
  who: Marysia
- line: But then if it's just 50 images, then maybe you cannot really do this.
  sec: 3050
  time: '50:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe not.
  sec: 3054
  time: '50:54'
  who: Marysia
- header: Marysia’s role at PyData
- line: Another topic that I wanted to talk to you about was your role with PyData.
    I know that outside of your work, you're quite involved in the PyData community.
    You are the co-chair of PyData Amsterdam, and in general, you're quite active
    with this, as I said at the beginning. I think I came across your talk in PyData
    Berlin this year and this is how we decided to reach out to you. Was it this year?
    I think I found you there.
  sec: 3056
  time: '50:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: I spoke at PyData Berlin twice. I think I did a tutorial this year.
  sec: 3088
  time: '51:28'
  who: Marysia
- line: Yeah. What was the tutorial about?
  sec: 3093
  time: '51:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was called Serious Time for Time Series. Time to take time series seriously.
  sec: 3098
  time: '51:38'
  who: Marysia
- line: Okay. I do remember seeing something like that.
  sec: 3103
  time: '51:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Quite a mouthful. [chuckles]
  sec: 3106
  time: '51:46'
  who: Marysia
- line: Yeah. [chuckles] So what's your role there? What do you do in the PyData community,
    apart from giving tutorials and talks?
  sec: 3107
  time: '51:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. So I joined PyData Amsterdam in 2019, I believe. I basically joined it
    because I enjoyed going to meetups. I studied artificial intelligence, I was focused
    on this very specific topic – deep learning for medical imaging – and I was just
    interested in everything about the field. I really enjoyed going to meetups and
    learning more about the experiences of others in the field as well. By joining
    the committee, I was able to organize this as well.
  sec: 3114
  time: '51:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: We organized the monthly meetup and we organized a yearly conference. So I've
    organized a conference for PyData Amsterdam, I've organized an online PyData festival
    for PyData Amsterdam, and I've organized PyData Global last year. This year, we’re
    full-on back on organizing PyData Amsterdam and making sure that we can create
    a really cool conference that brings together users and developers of basically
    open source packages in the data science ecosystem.
  sec: 3114
  time: '51:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: The confusion that a lot of people have about PyData – I know that the name
    is maybe a bit confusing – it's not just about Python, it's also for Julia and
    R users.
  sec: 3114
  time: '51:54'
  who: Marysia
- line: It is confusing, I must admit. [chuckles] Maybe it started as a Python conference,
    right?
  sec: 3180
  time: '53:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think so. [chuckles]
  sec: 3186
  time: '53:06'
  who: Marysia
- header: How Marysia joined PyData
- line: You said that in 2019, you joined the committee. But I don't think it happened
    that one day you woke up and walked in the committee and said, “Okay, do you mind
    if I join you?” It was something else, right? How did it happen that you joined
    them?
  sec: 3188
  time: '53:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it was actually 2018, come to think of it. But basically, I was attending
    a couple of meetups. At some point, the committee is on stage (it was actually
    Vincent who said on stage) and they said “Hey, is there anyone who would like
    to join the committee? In the break, come talk to me.” And that's how. I like
    organizing these kinds of things. When you organize it, you have the luxury of
    also determining what you organize.
  sec: 3208
  time: '53:28'
  who: Marysia
- line: So I get to organize the meetups that I like to attend and the conferences
    that I'd like to attend. I decided to volunteer and that's also how we got our
    entire new committee. We have about 16 people in our committee at the moment,
    to organize the conference and all of them joined, basically, because we just
    did a shout out at a meet up, like “Do you enjoy this kind of thing? Do you want
    to help shape this? Come and join us.”
  sec: 3208
  time: '53:28'
  who: Marysia
- line: I guess it's pretty useful to have a community and then you just say “Okay,
    does anyone want to help us?” [Marysia agrees] So this whole process doesn’t sound
    like it took a lot of time for you, actually – from the moment you started attending
    meetups to the moment you joined the committee.
  sec: 3254
  time: '54:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. No, that wasn't a long time, I think. I don’t remember when I first started
    going to meetups, though.
  sec: 3273
  time: '54:33'
  who: Marysia
- line: Well, I guess when you live in Amsterdam, there are so many meetups and communities
    that it’s just easy to be a part of one.
  sec: 3281
  time: '54:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that's one of the reasons why I really enjoyed helping out with PyData
    Global as well, because I realized I'm very privileged. I live in Amsterdam and
    one of the reasons why I attended a lot of meetups was because they were simply
    very close to my house. So if I didn't enjoy it, I could just go home. That's
    really nice about the city that I'm in. But, of course, a lot of people live in
    places where it's not as easy to attend meetups, and therefore share that knowledge
    and gather that knowledge.
  sec: 3289
  time: '54:49'
  who: Marysia
- line: That's what I really like about PyData Global. I personally do enjoy in-person
    meetups and conferences more, but I do think it's very important to make all of
    this information as accessible as possible. That's the idea behind Global – it's
    for everyone, all over the world. Anyone can join and that's why I like helping
    out there.
  sec: 3289
  time: '54:49'
  who: Marysia
- line: I guess it started in response to the pandemic, right? People couldn't just
    go to in-person meetups. But then, in addition to being able to connect during
    the pandemic, it also allowed people from any part of the world to join and also
    take part. If somebody does not live in Berlin, or Amsterdam, or New York, or
    any other big tech hub, then they can just connect to PyData Global from their
    village and take part in this, right?
  sec: 3331
  time: '55:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 3360
  time: '56:00'
  who: Marysia
- header: The difference between PyData and PyCon
- line: Cool. And what's the difference between PyData and PyCon?
  sec: 3361
  time: '56:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think the major difference is that PyCon is for everything Python, and PyData
    also is Julian and R. I'm not sure how PyCon feels about that. [chuckles] But
    we are focusing more on the data side of it. But it is actually the educational
    flag of NumFOCUS and all the proceeds of the conference that we organize go to
    support the open source ecosystem, specifically the packages that I, as a data
    scientist, use a lot – like NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit Learn – those kinds
    of packages. That's also what you'll see that most of the talks are about. Whereas
    PyCon, I would say, is generally a little bit broader than just data science and
    data analytics.
  sec: 3366
  time: '56:06'
  who: Marysia
- line: I still think there is some bias towards Python tools in PyData. A little.
    For historical reasons, right? [chuckles]
  sec: 3410
  time: '56:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. We have to make a conscious effort to make sure that the R and Julia
    folks feel included as well. I am mostly a Python user. I started with the Java
    Matplotlib, or Java and Matlab and then switched to Python. I’ve only played around
    with Julian and R. Most of these talks aren't really about the tools or about
    the language or about the code. It's more about the concept. So I think that translates
    well into other languages as well.
  sec: 3417
  time: '56:57'
  who: Marysia
- line: I remember one of the talks in PyData Berlin this year, was a general approach
    from a company who is selling cars – similar to what we do at OLX, which is why
    it was very interesting for me to check what the competitors are doing. And they
    use Java, for example. Which is not any of these three languages, yet the talk
    was quite nice. Maybe you should rename it to something like… you know how iPython
    notebooks got renamed to Jupyter?
  sec: 3448
  time: '57:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Julia, R and Python. That's what Jupyter is for, yeah.
  sec: 3482
  time: '58:02'
  who: Marysia
- line: So maybe it should be Jupyter data, instead of PyData?
  sec: 3485
  time: '58:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, maybe. But I don't… I'm very involved with the Amsterdam chapter, but
    I think there's like 100 chapters. I don't think I have the authority to change
    all of those names. [chuckles]
  sec: 3488
  time: '58:08'
  who: Marysia
- line: Yeah, probably not going to happen. Right? [chuckles]
  sec: 3498
  time: '58:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe not, no.
  sec: 3501
  time: '58:21'
  who: Marysia
- header: Finding Marysia online
- line: One last thing I wanted to ask you is –– how can people find you if they have
    any questions?
  sec: 3504
  time: '58:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a good question. I always really like it when people reach out.
    I'm reachable through LinkedIn. I have my website, which is Marysia.nl. Just my
    first name and “.nl” for the Netherlands. My email address is on there as well,
    so feel absolutely free to reach out. Also, if you want to get involved with PyData,
    or maybe speak, or maybe get some tips there, or talk about data-centric AI. I’m
    really happy to talk about this topic.
  sec: 3511
  time: '58:31'
  who: Marysia
- line: Okay, thanks a lot for joining us today. Thanks, everyone, for attending too.
    It's Friday today, so have a great rest of the week and have a nice weekend!
