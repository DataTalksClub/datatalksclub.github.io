description: 'Learn open source contribution tactics for scikit-learn pipelines and
  Rasa: make solid PRs, write docs & tests, boost your OSS skills and career visibility.'
intro: 'How do you start contributing to open source ML projects like scikit-learn
  pipelines—or move from curious user to confident contributor on Rasa’s conversational
  AI stack? In this episode, Vincent Warmerdam, Research Advocate at Rasa and creator
  of The Algorithm Whiteboard and calmcode.io, walks through practical, hands-on advice
  for contributing to open source ML. <br><br> Vincent shares his career pivot from
  design student to data scientist and highlights projects (evol, clumper, memo, whatlies,
  scikit-lego) that illustrate small-tools-to-impact workflows. We deep-dive into
  scikit-learn–compatible pipeline components, design principles for low-maintenance
  APIs, and common mistakes such as publishing to PyPI too early. You’ll get a documentation
  checklist (README, guides, API reference, examples), guidance on filing reproducible
  issues, and step-by-step preparation for pull requests: testing, CI, packaging,
  and pre-commit hooks. <br><br> Listeners will leave with concrete strategies for
  finding the right project, balancing large vs. small repositories, community stewardship
  and contribution etiquette, and ways OSS work can boost career visibility through
  talks, blogs, and meetups. If you want actionable next steps for contributing to
  open source ML, scikit-learn pipelines, PRs, docs, or Rasa conversational AI, this
  episode maps the path.'

transcript:
- line: Hi, welcome everyone. This event is brought to you by DataTalks.Club, a community
    of people who love data. We have two types of events. On Tuesdays, we usually
    have more technical events where we talk about technical topics, usually with
    a presentation with slides, like a webinar.
  sec: 2
  time: 0:02
  who: Alexey
- line: We will not have many of those in February because we have a conference, which
    I’ll talk more about later. We will come back to these events in March, and we
    already have one planned for March 2nd, about building scalable end-to-end data
    learning pipelines in the cloud. That’s a long title.
  sec: 22
  time: 0:22
  who: Alexey
- line: We also have a different kind of event, usually on Fridays. Today’s event
    is this type, even though it’s Thursday, where it’s more like a conversation.
    We talk about different things. Today the topic is open source. Tomorrow we will
    talk about envelopes.
  sec: 47
  time: 0:47
  who: Alexey
- line: On February 2nd, which is a Tuesday, we will talk about feature stores. Again
    in February, we will not have many events because of the conference. We will come
    back in March with a topic on public speaking.
  sec: 70
  time: '1:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Regarding the conference, it happens every Friday in February, with four tracks
    each day. First, we will talk about different use cases of machine learning. Then
    we’ll talk about products and processes. After that, we’ll talk about careers
    in data. Finally, we’ll cover machine learning in production.
  sec: 89
  time: '1:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: The link is on our website, datatalks.com, where you can find more information.
    For questions today, we will use Slido. I will share the link now in the chat.
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Here is the link we can use for asking Vincent any questions today. If you
    need to tend to a kid for a brief moment, that’s fine. We will start shortly.
  sec: 149
  time: '2:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let’s start. Today we’ll talk about open source. We have a special guest,
    Vincent Warmerdam. Vincent works as a Research Advocate at Rasa.
  sec: 189
  time: '3:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you check his LinkedIn profile, you will see quite a few things. He has
    been on the front page of Reddit. He is making a resource for people who want
    to learn coding, calmcod.io. He also organized the PyData Amsterdam conference.
  sec: 225
  time: '3:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: He is a data evangelist and an open source enthusiast. He is a creator and
    maintainer of some open source packages. That’s why we invited him today. Last
    but not least, he has over 80 endorsements for awesomeness on LinkedIn.
  sec: 243
  time: '4:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Welcome, Vincent. Thanks for coming to our event.
  sec: 265
  time: '4:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi. About the endorsements for awesomeness, at a previous company I had a
    bet with a CTO. We played a game to see who could get the most points for awesomeness
    on LinkedIn without asking for them. I might have cheated a little, but it wasn’t
    about bragging. It was a long-running bet.
  sec: 271
  time: '4:31'
  who: Vincent
- line: When I was reading your bio on LinkedIn, I thought, “Okay, awesomeness, let
    me check.” Of course, even one sentence influences the score.
  sec: 293
  time: '4:53'
  who: Vincent
- line: Before we get into open source, let’s talk a bit about your background. Can
    you tell us a bit about yourself and your journey so far?
  sec: 308
  time: '5:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don’t have a typical background. I was raised bilingually. I was born in
    the United States, lived there for a bit, and did most of my youth in the Netherlands,
    but I traveled to the U.S., which explains my accent. After high school, I wanted
    to study design, which I was keenly interested in.
  sec: 320
  time: '5:20'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'I remember getting a bad grade because the feedback was: “Vincent, you’re
    very creative, but you’re not using our 12-step program on brainstorming.” I thought,
    well, I don’t like where this is going. Then I learned about econometrics, an
    applied math field. They promised that I could predict stocks. That sounded awesome.'
  sec: 344
  time: '5:44'
  who: Vincent
- line: After the bachelor’s, I found out it’s kind of marketing it doesn’t actually
    predict stocks. So I quickly decided to take a master’s in operations research.
    Around that time, AI and machine learning were becoming popular. I took a free
    Stanford course with Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun, and I realized I liked
    programming more than consulting.
  sec: 373
  time: '6:13'
  who: Vincent
- line: I decided to try a career switch. I backpacked through Latin America with
    a laptop, doing some consulting along the way. I realized I preferred programming
    over going to clubs every night. When I came back to the Netherlands, I taught
    at a business school, but I wanted to focus on data science. A person I met at
    a meetup was starting a Hadoop company and needed someone who understood the math
    behind machine learning.
  sec: 408
  time: '6:48'
  who: Vincent
- line: I got a gig there, and the ball started rolling. I wanted PyData to happen
    in the Netherlands, so I did some community projects. I’m no longer formally involved
    with PyData, but I’m still around. I had lots of side projects, which eventually
    caught the attention of people at Rasa. They asked me to do my Vincent stuff on
    their stack, because they thought I could help.
  sec: 468
  time: '7:48'
  who: Vincent
- line: So that’s how you got hired.
  sec: 501
  time: '8:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Yes, it took me a while to realize they wanted to hire me permanently. For
    a long time, I thought it was just a collaborative project. Eventually, they said:
    “We’re talking about a career here, not a side project.” It took me a month to
    realize that. I’ve been there almost a year, and I really enjoy the culture.'
  sec: 507
  time: '8:27'
  who: Vincent
- line: It’s a diverse mix of people. It’s fun, and it’s not just about machine learning.
    One thing I try to pick up is how to work in non-English languages. For example,
    word embeddings trained left-to-right for English don’t work for Arabic. I get
    to reach out to communities, say here are some tools, and get feedback.
  sec: 540
  time: '9:00'
  who: Vincent
- line: This led to a couple of open source projects, which also led to some articles.
    The main thing I try to do is help people understand tools. Our engineers and
    researchers develop a lot of features, but having a tool is one thing understanding
    it is another. I like teaching, so that’s my focus.
  sec: 575
  time: '9:35'
  who: Vincent
- line: Your title is Research Advocate, right?
  sec: 606
  time: '10:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that’s the title we came up with.
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Vincent
- line: What are your responsibilities there?
  sec: 618
  time: '10:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s hard to explain. The data science field is still figuring out what it
    means to be a data scientist. Six years ago, being a data scientist meant figuring
    it out yourself. It involved a bit of programming, a bit of this, a bit of that.
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Vincent
- line: As a Research Advocate, I’m trying to figure out what it means while teaching
    and helping others. There’s freedom in shaping it myself.
  sec: 653
  time: '10:53'
  who: Vincent
- line: The thing is, especially with non-English languages, I really like the attitude
    that this job allows me. I do my best to make sure that a lot of these non-English
    tools are well supported in Rasa. I don’t want to give the impression that I know
    everything someone fluent in Arabic knows far more than I ever will.
  sec: 659
  time: '10:59'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'A lot of what I do is just listening to people: “Hey, you’re trying to make
    this digital assistant work with open source tools. What are your problems?” Maybe
    I can help benchmark something, or I can proxy it to the research team. They have
    really cool tools, and I make sure they’re well understood.'
  sec: 678
  time: '11:18'
  who: Vincent
- line: Sometimes the best thing I can do is make a YouTube video or a blog post.
    Sometimes it’s contributing to open source tools. That’s the ground I’m trying
    to cover. It’s a little bit of improvisation, but it’s good improvisation because
    I don’t have to pretend I know everything.
  sec: 702
  time: '11:42'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'Sometimes, as a consultant, you’re supposed to be the authority all the time.
    Here, I can just say: “Look, if you want to make a virtual assistant in any language
    community, tell me what I need to do, and I’ll gladly help.” That’s my main focus.'
  sec: 722
  time: '12:02'
  who: Vincent
- line: So basically, you’re someone between the technical team and the user?
  sec: 748
  time: '12:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it’s like a developer advocate with more focus toward research. I’ve
    actually written a research paper by accident this year. I made an open source
    package that’s super useful to some researchers. I make a lot of byproducts, which
    are useful to the community.
  sec: 754
  time: '12:34'
  who: Vincent
- line: Some of these are machine learning debugging tools that work on top of Rasa.
    Others help explore word embeddings or investigate bias in them. These aren’t
    core to what we do, but they help our community, which is great.
  sec: 777
  time: '12:57'
  who: Vincent
- line: Can you explain a bit about the company, Rasa, and what you’re developing?
  sec: 796
  time: '13:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s a little different. Elasticsearch helps with search, but the company
    isn’t implementing it for everyone directly. They have support contracts.
  sec: 802
  time: '13:22'
  who: Vincent
- line: On our side, we help companies make virtual assistants, but we focus on building
    the infrastructure. We provide the standard pipeline for a virtual assistant.
    If you need a very specific component, you can make that. We’re trying to provide
    the infrastructure layer.
  sec: 818
  time: '13:38'
  who: Vincent
- line: We aim to make it open source and pragmatic, so you can work with it. For
    example, you might want to host it on your own servers for healthcare applications.
    We provide the tools to do this in an open source way. It’s as simple as a pip
    install.
  sec: 837
  time: '13:57'
  who: Vincent
- line: Speaking of open source, what does open source mean to you?
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'I have to admit, I don’t consider myself super knowledgeable about all the
    details, like licenses. Some people take licenses very seriously. My approach
    has always been pragmatic: people made a bag of tools and tricks that are useful
    to me. I sometimes create my own tricks that others might not have made.'
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Vincent
- line: The best example is Psychic Lego, which I started with Matias from PyData
    Amsterdam. Some tools, like SciKit-Learn, are amazing, but there are tricks I
    use often that are experimental. I host those myself.
  sec: 906
  time: '15:06'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'This is how I approach open source: I scratch an itch, and others can find
    edge cases and help improve the code. That wouldn’t happen if I kept it private.'
  sec: 939
  time: '15:39'
  who: Vincent
- line: So everything on GitHub is automatically open source, as long as it’s not
    private?
  sec: 956
  time: '15:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, but I make a distinction. I have an open source project called Brent
    that I put on PyPI, but it’s not fully ready. There are edge cases that need to
    be fixed before it’s fully public. Hosting on GitHub is fine, but there’s a maturity
    step before publishing to a public package index.
  sec: 962
  time: '16:02'
  who: Vincent
- line: You mentioned Psychic Lego and Brent. Can you tell us more about them?
  sec: 1004
  time: '16:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Open source often starts with curiosity: I want to explore an idea or improve
    a user interface. For example, the library EVIL is an evolutionary algorithm library.
    The name is an anagram of “love evil.”'
  sec: 1022
  time: '17:02'
  who: Vincent
- line: I made EVIL with GoHere. We wanted to simplify genetic algorithms, which are
    usually a for-loop inside a for-loop inside a for-loop. We created a population
    object and an evolution object with a functional API. This makes evolutionary
    algorithms easier to use.
  sec: 1063
  time: '17:43'
  who: Vincent
- line: I haven’t touched the library in years, but it still gets a few hundred downloads
    a week. People blog about it because the API is simpler. Another library is Clumper,
    like pandas but for nested JSON objects, to make the API easier.
  sec: 1092
  time: '18:12'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'Memo is another tool, a set of decorators that log function outputs. If you’re
    doing grid search, Memo saves everything in a JSON file. That’s one branch of
    packages I make: improving usability.'
  sec: 1119
  time: '18:39'
  who: Vincent
- line: The other branch integrates with existing ecosystems. For scikit-learn, I
    made Psychic Lego, HumanLearn, and other tools. HumanLearn allows rule-based systems
    so domain experts can use “if this, then that.”
  sec: 1137
  time: '18:57'
  who: Vincent
- line: I also made WhatLies, which investigates word embeddings. It’s pipeline-compatible
    with Psychic Learn, so you can benchmark models quickly. You can check if a slower
    model is actually more accurate.
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Vincent
- line: You mentioned quite a few packages there were at least ten you listed.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I also do lots of stuff for Rasa, but that’s my employer, so that’s cheating.
    I write my packages so they don’t require a lot of maintenance. For example, I
    have one called ScheduleLord, which helps me maintain my cron jobs on my Raspberry
    Pis. It has documentation, but in reality, it has five users, and that’s fine.
  sec: 1224
  time: '20:24'
  who: Vincent
- line: I also have another tool called MakeTestDocs. It’s a package with two functions
    that make it easier to write unit tests for your markdown files. If you have Python
    examples in your README or MakeDocs template, you can just add one or two functions,
    and your documentation becomes your unit test. It’s easy to maintain two functions.
  sec: 1255
  time: '20:55'
  who: Vincent
- line: What caught my attention was the names of your packages. They’re very creative.
    How do you pick names for your projects?
  sec: 1286
  time: '21:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: My approach is pretty silly. A while ago, a buddy and I made a website called
    MakeNames.io. The idea is to use Pokémon names as a training dataset to generate
    new names. We also used the IKEA catalog as a corpus. It’s not meant to be a serious
    project.
  sec: 1297
  time: '21:37'
  who: Vincent
- line: Usually, I spend ten minutes generating names. If I get frustrated because
    they’re silly, I turn that into a sentence describing what the package does. For
    example, Psychic Lego is for building Lego-like blocks in a scikit-learn pipeline.
    HumanLearn lets humans put rules into scikit-learn. WhatLies investigates word
    embeddings. Clumper helps JSON clump together. Memo helps memorize stuff.
  sec: 1334
  time: '22:14'
  who: Vincent
- line: Naming is often the hardest part. In a past career, I did consultancy for
    the Dutch Flower Auction. The team culture was great because we named every new
    service. For example, a SQL database service was called Steven Sequal. When we
    upgraded it, we called it Steven C. Call the Sequel. A document store was called
    Jason Bourne.
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Vincent
- line: This silly naming competition made every service launch exciting. Communication
    improved because the names clearly described what the server should do.
  sec: 1425
  time: '23:45'
  who: Vincent
- line: So for Psychic Lego, the name reflects building blocks that can be combined
    into a pipeline?
  sec: 1505
  time: '25:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. It’s a scikit-learn-compatible pipeline component. Some are fancy, some
    are simple. For example, if you train a model and get an outlier during prediction,
    we have a component to clip it. It might not be useful for everyone, but it’s
    ready if someone needs it.
  sec: 1517
  time: '25:17'
  who: Vincent
- line: We also have meta-components. For instance, a classifier might use a threshold
    of 0.5. You could grid search to find a threshold that optimizes precision or
    recall. These tools help you investigate and adjust the model.
  sec: 1552
  time: '25:52'
  who: Vincent
- line: We have a question about getting started with open source. I’ve been coding
    for a while and will study computer science at university. How should I begin
    contributing to open source?
  sec: 1586
  time: '26:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on what you want to achieve. If you want to start your own project,
    ask if it’s easier to maintain it and convince others to use it, or contribute
    to an existing project. You can talk to maintainers and see if they’re interested
    in your contribution.

  who: Vincent
- line: If you’re a maintainer, you understand the project well, but you might not
    see what’s unclear to new users. If you hit a confusing error, open a GitHub issue
    suggesting improvements. That alone is already a contribution.
  sec: 1632
  time: '27:12'
  who: Vincent
- line: The first step is to use a tool, identify a problem, and create an issue.
    At Rasa, we have a contributor program. You can join via Slack, get PRs merged,
    give talks, or write blog posts, and we consider you a contributor.
  sec: 1680
  time: '28:00'
  who: Vincent
- line: For your first commit, don’t worry too much. Make sure you understand setup.py,
    flake8, black, pytest, and pre-commit hooks. Understanding Git and GitHub, including
    commits, merges, and pull requests, is also important.
  sec: 1720
  time: '28:40'
  who: Vincent
- line: Investing in these skills is sensible. Learn Python, Git, and GitHub basics,
    plus continuous integration and GitHub Actions. My site, Calmcod.io, has tutorials
    for all these tools. It helps you gain programming maturity beyond Jupyter notebooks.
  sec: 1795
  time: '29:55'
  who: Vincent
- line: Let’s say I want to contribute to a library like Psychic Learn. I know some
    Python and Git. What are the next steps?
  sec: 1813
  time: '30:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: The path I took is different because I organized events. Most packages I contribute
    to are maintained by someone I’ve met in real life. That makes it easier to discuss
    ideas.
  sec: 1832
  time: '30:32'
  who: Vincent
- line: Big projects like pandas have thousands of issues. Maintaining them is tricky.
    It may be better to start with a smaller library. Reach out on GitHub issues and
    see if maintainers are interested in your feature before starting work.
  sec: 1851
  time: '30:51'
  who: Vincent
- line: I contributed to a project called Dion. It’s a checklist for starting a machine
    learning project, checking for unintended side effects before deployment. They
    also accept anecdotes for documentation. It was a small, manageable way to contribute.
  sec: 1891
  time: '31:31'
  who: Vincent
- line: Dion is, as far as I’m concerned, one of the most impactful projects for preventing
    a lot of bad outcomes in machine learning. Dion is amazing. If you haven’t checked
    it out, you really should. We’ll share the links after the event.
  sec: 1920
  time: '32:00'
  who: Vincent
- line: So your suggestion is that big projects like pandas or scikit-learn might
    be too large to start contributing to. For example, in scikit-learn, there’s a
    policy where new algorithms must stand the test of time. You can’t just submit
    something you created yesterday.
  sec: 1938
  time: '32:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Exactly. Smaller projects are easier to get started with because the codebase
    is smaller, there are fewer issues, and it’s easier to communicate. The main thing
    is psychological: maintainers worry about whether a feature is broadly useful
    and whether contributors will stick around if something breaks.'
  sec: 1968
  time: '32:48'
  who: Vincent
- line: It’s easier to have these conversations in a smaller project setting. You
    can explain your interest in helping maintain the project. No one wants to inherit
    legacy code without context.
  sec: 2015
  time: '33:35'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'Another question: how do you find the time and energy to work on so many
    side projects? You mentioned 10, 20, quite a few, in addition to your work at
    Rasa. Do you have any productivity tips?'
  sec: 2027
  time: '33:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: A lot of my open source projects happen during my employer’s time. Even if
    it’s not personal work, I’m still learning and maintaining products on the job,
    which translates to my open source work. My employer doesn’t mind, which makes
    it easier.
  sec: 2053
  time: '34:13'
  who: Vincent
- line: I also realized after turning 30 that some activities, like video games, weren’t
    as fun as I thought. These days, I prefer hanging out with friends, exercising,
    and spending time at home with my wife and cats.
  sec: 2084
  time: '34:44'
  who: Vincent
- line: I also use an e-ink drawing tablet. The most productive thing you can do is
    think through a technical problem before typing a single character. Having the
    solution conceptually ready prevents wasted effort.
  sec: 2115
  time: '35:15'
  who: Vincent
- line: Sometimes you need to experiment in a notebook, but many people start coding
    without a plan, which wastes time. Planning first makes you more productive.
  sec: 2163
  time: '36:03'
  who: Vincent
- line: I remember your pinned tweet about this. How does it go?
  sec: 2168
  time: '36:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'It’s basically: “Vincent prefers common sense over hype. Let’s not solve
    the wrong problem.” I stand by this, especially in data science. People often
    optimize a numerical metric without considering errors in the problem translation
    itself.'
  sec: 2186

- line: Coming back to open source, in your opinion, what makes a good open source
    project?
  sec: 2225
  time: '37:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are a few things. One concept is stewardship. Being a steward of a project
    means more than just code; it’s about maintaining the ecosystem around it.
  sec: 2232
  time: '37:12'
  who: Vincent
- line: Even if your algorithm is twice as fast, if the documentation isn’t clear,
    no one will care. Docs, GitHub organization, and a clear onboarding path are crucial.
  sec: 2260
  time: '37:40'
  who: Vincent
- line: I like projects that make a real effort. If a project only has API references
    but no getting started guide, that’s frustrating. The path from knowing nothing
    to solving a problem must be defined.
  sec: 2280
  time: '38:00'
  who: Vincent
- line: For larger projects like Clumper, I like a homepage overview, a README with
    installation, problem description, and contribution info. Then a guides page for
    getting started and advanced topics. I also include an API reference with pictures
    for clarity.
  sec: 2316
  time: '38:36'
  who: Vincent
- line: I include example pages too. For WhatLies, there’s a page on research and
    bias in word embeddings, and one on working with Arabic embeddings. Examples give
    context and make it easier to reproduce results.
  sec: 2369
  time: '39:29'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'Documentation isn’t complete unless there’s both an API and examples. That’s
    what I aim for in more complex projects: a clear README, tutorials, advanced guides,
    and example usage.'
  sec: 2398
  time: '39:58'
  who: Vincent
- line: What about a contribution guide? Should that be part of the checklist?
  sec: 2425
  time: '40:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I usually include it. For example, in WhatLies, the README mentions contribution
    guidelines on GitHub. I try to make it clear that all issues are considered, but
    I avoid suggesting every issue will be implemented immediately.
  sec: 2438
  time: '40:38'
  who: Vincent
- line: One thing about stewardship I want to pay attention to is that I’ve noticed
    on some of my repos, some people are really unfriendly. You’re just wondering,
    are you sitting on a bag of nails? What is wrong with you? Why are you so angry
    that one particular feature isn’t in there? I’m doing volunteer work maintaining
    this stuff.
  sec: 2464
  time: '41:04'
  who: Vincent
- line: Regarding contribution guides and etiquette, I really try to emphasize small
    things. Don’t write sentences in all caps. It reads as if you’re shouting to me,
    and I’m doing volunteer work. I try to steer conversations on my issue list in
    that direction. I remember one guy on WhatLies saying, “Hey, you’re using Altair,
    but you should be using Bokeh. It’s way better.” That would lead to a really heated
    debate, and he wasn’t even willing to contribute. It’s a really weird situation,
    and it’s something I try to pay attention to.
  sec: 2488
  time: '41:28'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'If you’re starting out, you should probably not worry too much about that,
    but the basic rule is: don’t use all caps when adding an issue. That’s rude. Most
    of us don’t get paid to work on open source; most of us are doing it voluntarily.'
  sec: 2522
  time: '42:02'
  who: Vincent
- line: Sometimes we work on internal libraries at our company that aren’t necessarily
    specific to the company. You might think, “I want to release this as an open source
    project because other people will find it useful.” How do you convince your employer?
    I consider myself lucky because I’ve been organizing conferences and stuff, so
    it makes it easier for me to make this claim.
  sec: 2542
  time: '42:22'
  who: Vincent
- line: I can approach my employer and say, “Hiring people is marketing. If you want
    to hire talent, you want to show that your employees work on cool, interesting
    tools.” Even a small, silly project reflects well. For example, there’s a library
    that allows you to make Matplotlib charts in the command line ASCII art, following
    the Matplotlib API. It’s silly, but people notice. If a company produces fun,
    useful tools, it attracts attention.
  sec: 2578
  time: '42:58'
  who: Vincent
- line: Open source projects get attention, and presenting them at conferences is
    good for morale and hiring. Some companies gain visibility because their employees
    present open source work. I’ve seen a case where Basecamp stopped spending on
    marketing and instead built a “garbage fire” literally a conveyor belt burning
    things people emailed in. It was silly but drove traffic and engagement.
  sec: 2625
  time: '43:45'
  who: Vincent
- line: Convincing your employer depends on your company. Financial companies may
    have stricter rules due to legal concerns. But most tech companies are hiring,
    and showing open source contributions helps with employer branding. Some companies
    even allow one day per month dedicated to open source.
  sec: 2700
  time: '45:00'
  who: Vincent
- line: You can also view this as training. Early in the year, you may not be comfortable
    contributing; by the end of the year, you are. Investing time in your team this
    way often results in more original, meaningful contributions.
  sec: 2762
  time: '46:02'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'We have a question from Mikhail: any advice for someone starting their data
    science career and wanting to give their first conference talk?'
  sec: 2797
  time: '46:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Two things: first, imagine the reviewer’s perspective. Every conference has
    a committee deciding which talks are interesting. Second, write your proposal
    so it’s engaging. Would you attend this talk yourself? That’s the first filter.'
  sec: 2810
  time: '46:50'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'Conference style varies. At PyData Amsterdam, the vibe was playful and community-focused.
    Silly but educational talks were encouraged. One favorite example: someone analyzed
    metal lyrics to find the “most metal” English words. They never thought it would
    be a Python talk, but it was amazing. I even offered to help them prepare for
    the stage.'
  sec: 2848
  time: '47:28'
  who: Vincent
- line: Many people don’t realize their ideas are interesting. Even quirky observations
    about APIs or datasets can make good talks. The key is communicating why it’s
    engaging if read out of context.
  sec: 2913
  time: '48:33'
  who: Vincent
- line: Contributing to open source isn’t enough to consider submitting a conference
    proposal. If your work becomes open source, it’s great for employer branding.
    Talks showcase your skills and your company.
  sec: 2964
  time: '49:24'
  who: Vincent
- line: Even simple projects can make interesting talks. For example, scraping Meetup
    data, exploring outliers, and visualizing results with Neo4j can be educational
    and entertaining. Half the audience may already know the tools, the other half
    learns something new.
  sec: 2994
  time: '49:54'
  who: Vincent
- line: The best talks are entertaining while teaching. If you achieve both, that’s
    ideal. Showing how tools can be combined to solve problems is especially valuable
    for newcomers.
  sec: 3055
  time: '50:55'

    or establish a company?'
  sec: 3062
  time: '51:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’ll try to give advice, but I’ve been ridiculously privileged in the way
    I’ve been hired. It’s hard for me to know what it’s like to start out, because
    in the last ten years, every company that hired me, I didn’t have to talk to a
    recruiter it was always the CTO reaching out. That’s how the ball got rolling,
    so it’s hard for me to give proper advice.
  sec: 3076
  time: '51:16'
  who: Vincent
- line: In the end, it’s about showing the other party that you might be a team member
    who will make them better at something. I wouldn’t worry too much about joining
    an established company. There are lots of interesting ways to learn.
  sec: 3105
  time: '51:45'
  who: Vincent
- line: For example, I know someone who wanted to work somewhere to learn from others.
    They found a local municipality job with zero talent in that area. They realized
    that meant they would have control over what they learned and be paid to figure
    things out. So you don’t necessarily have to join an established company you can
    join something smaller and local and learn that way.
  sec: 3126
  time: '52:06'
  who: Vincent
- line: How does contributing to open source help you get a job?
  sec: 3167
  time: '52:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s helpful. Back when I was consulting, if someone had contributed meaningful
    things to open source projects we used with clients, that showed they understood
    the tools. That alone isn’t enough to guarantee a hire, but it’s a plus. Don’t
    over-stress it. If you have family and don’t do open source in the evenings, that’s
    fine. Companies often value a capable, enjoyable colleague more than open source
    contributions.
  sec: 3172
  time: '52:52'
  who: Vincent
- line: Open source can help convince the other side of your capability. Giving talks
    or presenting interesting projects is another way to demonstrate skill. My most
    popular talk was on simple linear models, mostly linear regression. It got the
    most views ever. You don’t need fancy, state-of-the-art work; if you explain a
    problem well, it’s enough. Entertain and teach.
  sec: 3196
  time: '53:16'
  who: Vincent
- line: When reviewing talks, both teaching and entertainment matter. You don’t need
    to do both perfectly; even teaching alone is valuable. Sharing links to your talks
    is useful.
  sec: 3314
  time: '55:14'
  who: Vincent
- line: You mentioned that early in your career, CTOs reached out to you. How did
    that happen?
  sec: 3326
  time: '55:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Luck played a large role. It usually started with meetups. I began giving
    free R trainings to app developers, teaching them how to analyze user data. People
    remember someone who helps them, and if the training was good, they would refer
    you. It’s about being visible and meeting people.
  sec: 3360
  time: '56:00'
  who: Vincent
- line: It’s not just open source; teaching, giving trainings, and being present in
    the community helps. When I started, I was the first person I knew to call themselves
    a data scientist. Skills back then were enough to get started. I had experience
    building recommenders for companies that didn’t have them yet. Timing and location
    mattered too being in Amsterdam helped attract speakers and attention.
  sec: 3434
  time: '57:14'
  who: Vincent
- line: Today, you might focus on free training for cloud tools instead of R. YouTube
    and online resources weren’t as abundant back then. I would negotiate with companies
    for rooms to give trainings on weekends, which taught life skills.

    first conference talk used World of Warcraft auction house data to find a hack

Today we're talking open source with our guest, **Vincent Warmerdam**. Vincent is a Research Advocate at Rasa. If you check his LinkedIn, you'll see a lot: he's made Reddit's front page, runs calmcode.io for learning to code, has organized PyData Amsterdam and AI Saturdays Amsterdam, and he's a data evangelist and open-source enthusiast who's created and maintains several open-source packages. And—last but not least—he has over 80 LinkedIn endorsements for "awesomeness." Welcome, Vincent!

**Vincent:** Hi! About those "awesomeness" endorsements—at a previous company I had a running bet with a CTO: who could get the most "awesomeness" endorsements without asking. So yes, I'm slightly cheating there—but it's been a years-long joke.

In this interview, we covered:

- [Vincent's journey from design student to Research Advocate](#vincent's-journey-and-open-source-philosophy)
- [Secrets to successful project naming and documentation](#building-and-managing-open-source-projects)
- [Step-by-step guide to making your first contributions](#how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source-projects)
- [Leveraging open source for career advancement and visibility](#career-advancement-through-open-source-projects)

## Vincent's Journey and Open Source Philosophy

**Q: Could you walk us through your career journey and how you ended up in open source?**

**Vincent:** I grew up bilingual—born in the U.S., raised mostly in the Netherlands, with lots of travel back to the U.S. After high school, I wanted to study design, but I got a bad grade for not using a prescribed brainstorming framework—so I pivoted. I discovered econometrics (applied math), and they promised I'd predict stocks… which, spoiler alert, you can't. I did a master's in operations research instead. Around then, AI/ML was getting hyped—there was the free Stanford AI course with Norvig and Thrun; I was an early student. I realized I liked programming more than suit-and-tie consulting.

I backpacked through Latin America with a laptop, did some consulting, and told myself: if I prefer coding to going clubbing every night, that's my sign. Coding won. Back in the Netherlands, I taught at a business school (good money), but wanted data science. I met someone at a meetup who was starting a Hadoop company and needed math for ML—that got me in. I helped bring PyData to the Netherlands and did community work (I'm no longer formally involved). I blogged, built side projects, and Rasa noticed. They asked if I could do my "Vincent stuff" on their stack. It took me a month to realize they meant a full-time role.

**Q: As a Research Advocate at Rasa, what does your role actually involve, and how does it differ from a traditional Developer Advocate?**

**Vincent:** The title is new—we're still defining it, like data science roles were years ago. Think "developer advocate," but closer to research. I make sure non-English languages are better supported (e.g., right-to-left languages like Arabic need different handling). I listen to practitioners building assistants and surface their needs; I also translate what our researchers and engineers build into practical guides. Sometimes that's a blog or video; sometimes it's an open-source tool. I even co-authored a research paper by accident because a tool I made was useful to researchers. I ship a lot of "byproducts": debugging tools on top of Rasa, word-embedding exploration and bias tools, etc.—not the core product, but helpful for the community.

**Q: For those unfamiliar with Rasa, could you explain what the company actually does and how it's positioned in the market?**

**Vincent:** Think of Elastic: they build search infrastructure; they don't build every search app. Rasa builds the *infrastructure* for virtual assistants: standard pipelines, components you can swap, deploy on your own servers (important for healthcare, etc.). Open source and pragmatic—`pip install` and go.

**Q: How do you personally define open source, and what philosophy guides your approach to creating and sharing open source tools?**

**Vincent:** I'm not a license wonk—there are nuances—but my framing is pragmatic. Others shared tools that made my career possible; when I have useful tools, I share them back. Scikit-learn is amazing, but there are experimental tricks they won't include. Nothing stops me from publishing compatible extras.

One caveat: putting code on GitHub is fine, but publishing on PyPI should wait until it's mature. I have a project called Brent that I put on PyPI too early—I'd prefer it had stayed GitHub-only until it was ready.

**Q: Your pinned tweet emphasizes "preferring common sense over hype." How does this philosophy apply to open source development and avoiding the trap of solving the wrong problems?**

**Vincent:** It's easy to optimize a metric by 1% while ignoring a 10% mismatch between the real business problem and the analytical proxy. Keep the real problem front and center.

## Building and Managing Open Source Projects

**Q: You've created and maintain several popular open source packages. Could you walk us through some of your key projects and explain how they came to be?**

**Vincent:** Ideas come from curiosity or wanting a better API. Examples:

* **evol** — evolutionary algorithms with a cleaner API (functional style with `Population`/`Evolution` objects) so it's easier to maintain than nested for-loops
* **clumper** — "pandas, but for nested JSON" with a friendly API
* **memo** — decorators that log function outputs; great for grid searches so you get a JSON trail
* **sklego (scikit-lego)** — extra "lego bricks" for scikit-learn
* **human-learn** — rule-based systems inside scikit-learn ("if this then that"), making human rules grid-searchable
* **whatlies** — explore what lies in word embeddings (visualization + scikit-learn-compatible transformers so you can benchmark quickly)
* Smaller tools like **schedulelord** (cron helpers for Raspberry Pi) and **make-test-docs** (two functions to treat docs/examples as unit tests)

I try to design for low maintenance: small, focused APIs, good docs, and compatibility with existing ecosystems—especially scikit-learn—so people can slot tools into pipelines and compare fairly ("is the 10× slower model also 10× better?").

**Q: Let's dive deeper into scikit-lego. What specific problems does it solve, and how do these "lego bricks" integrate with existing scikit-learn workflows?**

**Vincent:** Exactly—scikit-learn–compatible pipeline components. Some are fancy; some are simple but practical. Example: if your model expects values in [0, 1] but sees a 1,000,000 at inference, it'll behave badly. We have a transformer that clips values to a max—so that outlier becomes 1. It's a drop-in component rather than reinventing the wheel.

We also have interesting **meta-components**. Take classifier thresholds: instead of always using 0.5, you can grid-search the threshold to trade precision/recall. Our components let you tune that inside a pipeline.

**Q: Your project names are wonderfully creative and descriptive. What's your process for naming projects, and why is good naming so important?**

**Vincent:** I actually made **makenames.io** with a friend—a silly name generator trained on Pokémon and IKEA catalogs. I'll generate names for 10 minutes, get frustrated, and then blurt out the clear description—that often *is* the name. I want names that say what they do: *scikit-lego* (lego bricks for scikit-learn), *human-learn* (human rules in sklearn), *whatlies* (what lies in embeddings), *clumper* (clump JSON), *memo* (memorize/log). At a former job, we turned naming into a team sport—*Steven Sequel* for a SQL service; the upgrade was *Steven C. Call: The Sequel*; a document store named *JSON Bourne*. It sounds goofy, but it boosted team energy and clarity: a good name forces you to be clear about what the thing does.

**Q: What are the key elements that make an open source project successful and maintainable, and how do you handle community contributions while maintaining a positive environment?**

**Vincent:** Not just code—**stewardship**. Great docs and a clear path from "zero to solving a problem." My doc checklist:

* **README/Home:** what it does, installation, a concise problem statement, maybe a logo, contribution notes
* **Guides:** a "Getting Started" and at least one **advanced** guide
* **API reference:** every function/method clearly described (images help)
* **Examples:** end-to-end notebooks showing real tasks (e.g., bias analysis with word embeddings, benchmarking embeddings for Arabic)

If there's no "Getting Started," adoption dies. Good docs are part of the product.

For contributions, I include a guide—on *whatlies*, the README has it even if the docs site doesn't. I try to set expectations: every issue is considered, but that doesn't mean it'll be implemented immediately. Stewardship also means nudging for good behavior. Sometimes folks are… unfriendly. Please don't write in ALL CAPS—it reads like shouting. I'm doing volunteer work; basic courtesy helps. I once had someone insist I must use Bokeh instead of Altair and then refuse to contribute—heated debate, zero code. A contribution guide should discourage that and keep discussions constructive.

## How to Start Contributing to Open Source Projects

**Q: For someone who wants to start contributing to open source, what would you recommend as the best first steps, and how should they approach contributing to large projects versus smaller ones?**

**Vincent:** It depends on your goal. Shipping your own library is different from contributing to an existing one. A great first contribution is **using** a tool, hitting a confusing error, and opening a clear **GitHub issue** with a repro and suggested fix (even just a better error message). That already helps maintainers a lot.

At Rasa, we recognize contributors beyond code—merged PRs, good talks, helpful blog posts. If you want to make your **first code PR**, invest in ecosystem basics: `setup.py`/packaging, `pytest`, `flake8`, `black`, pre-commit hooks, Git/GitHub workflows, and CI (e.g., GitHub Actions). Calmcode.io has short tutorials on many of these.

For large projects like scikit-learn, there's lots of traffic and process—they require algorithms to stand the test of time. Consider **smaller projects** where discussion is easier. Start by opening an issue to **propose** your idea—don't code a big feature before the maintainer is interested. As a maintainer, I worry about (1) general usefulness (vs. niche) and (2) long-term **maintenance**—will the contributor stick around? Address those in your proposal.

Projects like **DION** (a checklist for ML risks and unintended side effects) welcome contributions—even anecdotes for docs. It's impactful and approachable.

**Q: How do you manage to find time and energy for so many open source projects while maintaining quality, and what productivity strategies do you use?**

**Vincent:** A lot of my open-source work happens in my employer's time, with their support—so I learn at work and apply it elsewhere (and vice versa). Personally, I've shifted my free time: fewer video games, more tinkering, plus exercise, friends, and family. Productivity tip: **don't start by coding**. Use paper or an e-ink tablet to design the solution first. You should know the shape of the solution before typing a character; exploratory notebooks are the exception, not the rule.

## Career Advancement Through Open Source Projects

**Q: Many developers have internal tools at work that could benefit the broader community. How can someone convince their employer to open source internal libraries, and what are the business benefits for companies?**

**Vincent:** Position it as **hiring and brand** leverage. Cool OSS attracts attention—people check out the company behind it. Talks about your tools boost morale and serve recruiting. There was even a company that built a whimsical "garbage fire" demo; the blog about it drove real product interest. More broadly, some companies give employees a day a month for OSS. Treat it as **training**—contributing grows engineering maturity (Git, CI, packaging, reviews). Yes, regulated domains (e.g., finance) may limit this; be respectful of legal constraints.

**Q: How can open source work and conference speaking help with career advancement, and what strategies have helped you build visibility in the industry?**

**Vincent:** For conference talks, write your proposal so a reviewer thinks, "I'd attend this." At PyData Amsterdam, our rule was just that. Entertaining + educational is gold, but either alone is fine. Great talks often come from "simple but insightful" topics: a weird pandas trick that saved your day, how JSON parsing really works, or a fun dataset (e.g., "Which English words are the most *metal*?"). Many people don't realize their blog post could be a fantastic talk—submit it!

OSS contributions can de-risk you as a candidate—if you've meaningfully contributed to tools a team uses, they know you understand them. It's not a silver bullet, and lack of OSS (family, time, etc.) shouldn't disqualify anyone. Talks and blogs work too—my most-watched talk was about winning with **simple models** (yes, linear regression). Clear thinking > flashy hype.

For building visibility: **meetups and teaching.** I gave free R trainings to app devs, organized events, and said "yes" a lot. Visibility scales better than trying to meet everyone individually. Luck played a role too: being early in "data science," building first recommenders, living in Amsterdam—all helped.

**Q: As we wrap up, could you reflect on how the Research Advocate role at Rasa differs from traditional Developer Advocate positions, and what you see as the future of this type of role?**

**Vincent:** DevRel is a well-trodden path—there are even DevRel conferences. Research Advocacy at Rasa is similar but closer to research. I explore ideas, prototype, sanity-check with researchers, and bring community feedback back to the team (especially for non-English use cases). Next, I want to build a personal Slack assistant with Rasa—automating my own workflows—then share the journey so developers can replicate it. It's a two-way bridge: community ↔ research.
