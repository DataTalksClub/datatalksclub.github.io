short: Leading Data Research
title: Leading Data Research
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about being a professor and leading data research. We
    have a special guest today, David. David is the director of the Institute for
    Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is also a distinguished
    professor at the Department of Data Science in Ying Wu College of Computing. His
    interests are at the intersection of data science, Big Data, high performance
    computing and real-world applications, including cybersecurity, massive scale
    analytics, and computational genomics.
  sec: 107
  time: '1:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's quite a lot of interests. So what is interesting when I read David's
    bio was that he co-authored over 300 articles. This is actually one of the topics
    – one of the things we'll cover today – how is it humanly possible to actually
    do this? But yeah, that's a bit of a teaser. Welcome, David.
  sec: 107
  time: '1:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. And thank you for that kind introduction. That's right. I'm David
    Bader. And now I've been, for just over three years, a Distinguished Professor
    at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where I launched a brand new institute
    for data science back in summer of 2019. That institute includes a number of centers,
    ones related to big data, to cybersecurity, to medical informatics, AI and machine
    learning and also FinTech, which is a strength of the New Jersey / New York Region.

  who: David
- header: David’s background
- line: I kind of cut your biography a little bit because it was too long. [chuckles]
    And I apologize, maybe I left out the important part. But your biography is amazing
    and that's one of the reasons we want to have a chat today. Maybe, before we start,
    before we go into today’s main topic of leading data research and being a professor,
    can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 200
  time: '3:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I'll tell you about my career in brief. I think my full CV is over 100
    pages, so I'll try to limit it to just a word or two. But I grew up in Pennsylvania
    in the United States, and I did my undergraduate and Master's degree in Electrical
    and Computer Engineering at Lehigh University. Then I did a PhD in electrical
    and computer engineering at the University of Maryland.
  sec: 226
  time: '3:46'
  who: David
- line: I've held faculty positions at the University of New Mexico, where I was a
    Regents lecturer and also a professor there. I joined Georgia Tech in 2005 to
    launch the School of Computational Science and Engineering. I was at Georgia Tech
    for about 14 years before moving to the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where
    I am today. So I've spent time at quite a number of universities and have a research
    career spanning almost 30 years.
  sec: 226
  time: '3:46'
  who: David
- header: A day in the life of a professor
- line: That's impressive. What do you do as a professor? You already mentioned things
    such as launching a school, or some other things. Is this something professors
    do? What do you usually do?
  sec: 293
  time: '4:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Great question. I, of course, do research, teaching in service to the Institute
    and also to the national and international community. But a typical day is meeting
    with my students on research and also working with my institute – my faculty and
    staff – to make sure that we have projects running, new proposals that we're submitting
    to sponsors.
  sec: 308
  time: '5:08'
  who: David
- line: I also teach, which means preparing for lectures, giving lectures, and interacting
    with students. The core of what I do is really interacting with students. In my
    research group today, I have high school students, so they're pre-college. I have
    undergraduate students, Masters and PhD students, as well as research scientists
    who have completed their PhD in previous years. So it's quite a diverse group
    of students, both men and women, and at all levels.
  sec: 308
  time: '5:08'
  who: David
- header: David’s current projects
- line: So as a professor, you do meetings with students, you keep projects running,
    you make sure proposals have been submitted to sponsors, and you interact with
    students. And some of the things, such as making sure projects are running, that
    proposals are being submitted, are some sort of project management, right? Your
    research is a project, and you need to manage that it's actually executed – that
    people actually work on things. Is this a correct interpretation?
  sec: 371
  time: '6:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Currently, I have three projects from the National Science Foundation in the
    US. One is looking to build out massive scale graph analytics using an open source
    framework called Arkouda. Another is developing a streaming analytics platform
    called StreamWare. These types of projects often require coordination among a
    number of personnel. We are doing research and then we're writing papers about
    the research that we do. Though, at the same time, we're writing proposals for
    new projects that will launch after this. I also work with industry quite a bit.
    I have active engagements today with Accenture labs – we're looking at a cybersecurity
    problem involving the use of graphs, where we're trying to find vulnerabilities
    across open source software packages. We also work with other companies like NVIDIA.
  sec: 401
  time: '6:41'
  who: David
- line: I have an NVIDIA AI lab (or NVAIL) award at NJIT and I've worked with a lot
    of companies in the past as well, such as Intel, Exxon Mobil. I've worked with
    Yahoo, with Microsoft Research – quite a number of companies. And that's really
    exciting, to be able to be at the forefront of developments and looking at data
    science and also at the intersection with high performance computing, and to have
    ideas that we developed with our students that can then be transitioned into practice,
    whether it's through industry or startup companies or other types of organizations.
    I find it quite exciting.
  sec: 401
  time: '6:41'
  who: David
- header: Starting a school
- line: This is not something I actually prepared for – it wasn’t in the list of questions
    – but I'm really curious, what does it take to actually start a school? Like,
    to launch a school? Maybe it's a very simplistic picture, but I guess you need
    to come up with a bunch of projects, a bunch of ideas, and then you also need
    to have connections with industry, because you need money for running and establishing
    the school. What else is required to start a school?
  sec: 510
  time: '8:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a great question. Most faculty will join a department at a university
    and the department's been around for anywhere from a couple of years to decades
    or even centuries (in Europe) and that's fine. But twice in my career, I've been
    able to essentially do a startup within academia. At Georgia Tech, as I mentioned,
    I founded the School of Computational Science and Engineering and here at the
    New Jersey Institute of Technology, last year, I founded the Department of Data
    Science. So I've now done startups twice within academia. And what it requires
    – the first thing that you need – are people.
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: David
- line: You need people who are really thinking about new directions. I'd like to
    think that innovation within academia is really finding interesting work at the
    interface between traditional departments, and especially in computer and data
    science. We find so many new areas that are just outside of a single discipline.
    For instance, my own research in massive scale analytics requires expertise in
    data science, in high performance computing, in systems, in algorithms, and also
    in application areas. So we have to weave together many areas of knowledge to
    be able to produce students who are able to really be impactful as they graduate,
    and they go on in their careers. So very briefly – what does it take to create
    these schools and departments?
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: David
- line: It takes people and also new academic programs. We spend quite some time thinking
    about “What does a new program look like, for instance, in data science?” This
    past fall, we launched one of the earliest Bachelor's degree programs in data
    science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. We've had a Master's program
    since 2017 and we're at the cusp of launching a new PhD program in data science.
    So I think it's quite fascinating to be able to think about “What does it take
    to train students to have degree programs in these emerging areas, like data science?”
    And I hope other universities will also repeat the model that we've created for
    this training and preparation of students for data science.
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: David
- line: Yeah, now I realize that when I was asking this question, I was more thinking
    about research labs, rather than schools. But then, actually with schools – the
    main reason for a school to exist is to teach people. These people then graduate
    and are then qualified for the job. To start the school, you need to see “Okay,
    there is this university, and then there is this area. And for this area, there
    is no school for this university.”
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: What happens then? You identified this gap, and then do you just approach
    the university and say, “Hey, how about we just start a data science department?”
    Or do you first start working there and then you say, “Okay, but these students
    are really great. Let's start the department there.”? How does it work?
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: What I've done is, really, looked at “Where's the need?” And we see there's
    such a demand right now for students educated in data science. That need is really
    the main driver, because we don't want to just create programs where students
    won't be able to find jobs afterward. We want students to be productive as they
    graduate and data science is a growing area. So first is identifying the need.
    We'd also look at the regions. It doesn't make sense, for instance, for every
    university to launch every degree program and have it the same as every other
    university out there.
  sec: 733
  time: '12:13'
  who: David
- line: We really have to look at “What are the needs of the region?” Here at New
    Jersey Institute of Technology, over a third of our students are the first time
    anyone in their family is going to college. We're taking students from a very
    diverse background, and some who are really new at going into higher education
    within their families and we're making them well prepared to enter the job market
    – the workforce – in this region, in New Jersey, New York, and the tri-state area,
    as well as to be national players as well. Also potentially international, because
    we have students who will either return to countries that they came from in Europe
    and Asia, or they may find jobs that are international in nature. So we want to
    have very well rounded students.
  sec: 733
  time: '12:13'
  who: David
- header: The different types of professors
- line: Also, one of the things in your biography is that you're a distinguished professor.
    I was wondering – what is the difference between just a professor and a distinguished
    professor? Which one is better? Or can you even say that one is better than the
    other? [chuckles]
  sec: 835
  time: '13:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a designation that's unique to every university – different universities
    have different ranks. Generally, in the US, we have assistant professors – usually
    they’re before a tenure decision, which is a guarantee of employment. There are
    associate professors who typically gain that promotion once they're tenured. And
    then there are full professors who are what you would think of as an “internationally
    known professor” – one whose research has really resonated internationally.
  sec: 852
  time: '14:12'
  who: David
- line: At NJIT, we have those three ranks as well, but we've added a fourth rank
    “distinguished professor,” where the bar is significantly higher for that promotion
    to distinguished professor. Each year, just a handful of senior faculty at the
    “professor” rank are then promoted to “distinguished professor,” once they are
    at the top echelon of their fields.
  sec: 852
  time: '14:12'
  who: David
- line: If I'm interpreting this correctly, a professor without any associate assistants
    and so on – it describes the type of work you do. I think this is what you told
    us – you work with students, you work with research projects, you work with sponsors
    – this type of work is what we can call “professor,” right? And then there are
    different grades, so to say. For example, maybe an assistant professor would have
    a small scope, and the next level professor would have a wider scope and so on.
    Is that right?
  sec: 917
  time: '15:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: In the US, which is slightly different from the European system, all professors
    – assistant, associate, and fuller – are typically doing research, teaching, and
    service. The designation of assistant, associate, full and even distinguished,
    really is a statement of the impact that that professor has had so far. Normally,
    an assistant professor may be just out of graduate school, or has done a postdoc
    and joined a faculty, but they're still very early in their career. Usually, after
    about six to seven years, a promotion and tenure decision occurs for promotion
    to associate professor. Then, some faculty are associate professors their whole
    year – sort of their whole careers.
  sec: 959
  time: '15:59'
  who: David
- line: Others, once they achieve national or international recognition, then may
    try to become a full professor at their university, which normally happens maybe
    another six to ten years at a minimum beyond their promotion to associate professor.
    So it takes a long time and really, it's measured by their impact and the candidate
    is evaluated by peers from other universities who then write letters as to whether
    or not that professor has achieved the rank of a full professor. It’s the same
    with distinguished professors, but the bar for distinguished is even higher than
    just a full professor at NJIT.
  sec: 959
  time: '15:59'
  who: David
- line: What does the process look like before the professorship? I assume that it
    all starts with being a PhD student, right? This is like the “entry-level” role
    in academia. Maybe a graduate student, and then a PhD student. Then after a student
    graduates, they can become a postdoc. Right?
  sec: 1061
  time: '17:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's right. Some PhD graduates will enter a postdoc. Normally, a postdoc
    is a limited position from one to three years in the US, where they may join another
    research group, either at a university or a national laboratory. After the postdoc,
    they either enter full time technical staff positions, or assistant professor
    positions within universities. But it's not required to do a postdoc.
  sec: 1088
  time: '18:08'
  who: David
- line: There are faculty who joined as an associate professor immediately after completing
    their dissertation and getting awarded their PhD. The PhD is really an entry degree
    to do research. Some PhD graduates will join universities, others will join research
    labs at companies and do quite well in industry.
  sec: 1088
  time: '18:08'
  who: David
- line: Industry CVs versus academia CVs
  sec: 1088
  time: '18:08'
  who: David
- line: Just curious – I took a look at your CV (I think we talked a bit about that)
    and your CV is 106 pages long. In industry, if you listen to any podcast about
    career and CV recommendations, they will tell you that you should keep your CV
    at a minimum of one page and two pages max. I think there is even the rule of
    thumb that you should have one page for every 10 years of experience. It looks
    like in academia, it's the complete opposite. Is it typical that professors have
    CVs that are that long?
  sec: 1143
  time: '19:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think 106 pages is probably excessive and lynched for academia. But we're
    expected to list everything that we've done in terms of students mentored, classes
    we've taught, papers we've published, research projects that we have been the
    lead investigator on, and so on. And so my CV is just naturally long, because
    I've done a lot of things. You might have noticed the first page is really a one-page
    extended biography and that's really my one-pager of highlights if you don't want
    to read the next 105 pages – that one page is great. But I've had a great career.
  sec: 1195
  time: '19:55'
  who: David
- line: I graduated with my PhD in 1996, which was just over 25 years ago, and have
    been very active. I've led over 90 projects from the National Science Foundation,
    Department of Defense, Department of Energy, NASA, as well as working with leading
    companies. And I've graduated quite a number of students, and as you mentioned
    earlier, published and co-authored over 300 papers. It's been a very productive
    career, hence the extra pages in my CV. This is a typical format for academia
    versus industry – you’re right, CVs are typically one to two pages of highlights.
    But in academia, we're expected to list everything.
  sec: 1195
  time: '19:55'
  who: David
- line: The reason that this usually happens in industry is that the hiring managers
    – people who decide to hire for a role – receive quite a lot of applications and
    they simply don't have time to go through every CV. That's why there is this suggestion
    that if you want a hiring manager to actually look at your CV and read it, then
    you should keep it at a minimum. But my understanding is that in academia, that's
    different. People will actually go through and check. The professor is quite a
    big position, so if you want to get hired as a professor, people take time to
    evaluate all the work. Right?
  sec: 1288
  time: '21:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's right. And it's a privilege to be a professor. The work that I've done
    – I'm also very proud of the service that I've accomplished. For instance, I been
    chairing a committee for the National Science Foundation – a committee of visitors
    for the office of advanced cyberinfrastructure, and evaluating the NSF office
    that looks at advanced cyberinfrastructure, which includes networks and workforce
    development, and some of the most capable systems in the world for computing and
    data science. There's a lot of service that I do as well, that's quite well-documented
    in my CV. I'm very proud of that work and I apologize if you had to make it through
    those 106 pages.
  sec: 1328
  time: '22:08'
  who: David
- line: '[chuckles] Just curious, out of these 106 pages, how many pages are about
    your papers? You said you have 300 papers, right? And then you have 106 pages
    in your CV, so is a third of the CV papers or less?'
  sec: 1383
  time: '23:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe. I didn't look at the actual length, but maybe approximately that. Every
    time we publish a paper in a journal, or present at a conference, there's another
    line that gets added to the CV. It's been quite a lot of work, but I've had some
    great co-authors and students. We normally publish a few papers a year. As you
    can see, “a few” adds up over a period. That's almost 30 years in length.
  sec: 1397
  time: '23:17'
  who: David
- header: David’s recent papers
- line: Can you tell us about some of your recent papers? I think you mentioned a
    few projects that you do. There was a project about graph analytics, right? I
    assume that this is one of the active projects that you're working on right now.
    Maybe you can tell us about some papers you published recently?
  sec: 1432
  time: '23:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. We're just finishing up a paper right now and it's on a framework that
    we're calling ARACHNE, the Greek word for “spider” and looking at interactive
    graph analytics at scale. There's an open source framework called Arkouda and
    Arkouda is spelled A R K O U D A – it's the Greek word for “bear”. You can find
    this on GitHub. This project started just about three years ago as an open source
    framework for doing massive scale data science. Often, you may find that you have
    datasets that are terabytes in size, maybe tens or dozens of terabytes, and no
    existing enterprise framework is able to interact with datasets that large.
  sec: 1450
  time: '24:10'
  who: David
- line: We have analysts who want to be able to run queries. They're trained in Python,
    they like using NumPy, and Pandas. And what we've tried to do with Arkouda is
    develop a framework that is able to take an analyst who knows Python, and substitute
    out NumPy for Arkouda, to be able to look at running where the dataset may sit
    in a supercomputer on the back end because of its size, and then operate in near
    real-time, just like you're in your Jupyter notebook and you're running Python
    and you issue a command, you want it to return fairly quickly. It’s the same way
    here, we don't want to wait hours and hours – we want a near real-time response.
  sec: 1450
  time: '24:10'
  who: David
- line: We want the productivity of Python, with the performance of a supercomputer
    and that's what Arkouda is providing. Now, as I mentioned earlier, what we're
    building out in Arkouda is a sub-piece of the framework called ARACHNE for graph
    analytics. Often our datasets represent graphs, where we have relationships between
    entities, and these graphs can come from system logs – maybe we're doing some
    cybersecurity analysis of our syslog. It could come from information about our
    customers, it could come from social media.
  sec: 1450
  time: '24:10'
  who: David
- line: Many, many sources generate large volumes of data and we want to be able to
    manipulate these datasets running graph analytics, such as connected components
    between a centrality breadth-first search and others. We want to count triangles,
    compute clustering coefficients, find K-trusses, run new centrality measures,
    like triangle centrality, and we're building out the analytics to be able to do
    that. This has been joint work with my students. We're publishing a paper coming
    up in September at the IEEE HPEC conference (high-performance extreme computing)
    that will be held in Massachusetts in September. We're really excited about this
    work.
  sec: 1450
  time: '24:10'
  who: David
- header: Similarities and differences between research labs and startups
- line: What you described sounds like a typical startup. What you said “Productivity
    of Python with...” What was it?
  sec: 1630
  time: '27:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: With supercomputer performance.
  sec: 1642
  time: '27:22'
  who: David
- line: Exactly. It's like a really good elevator pitch, right? Does a research group
    have to be like a startup in academia?
  sec: 1644
  time: '27:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right, the research groups are like a startup. That's a great analogy. What
    we want to do is really have an impact. Instead of just publishing papers, we
    also produce code and it's open source on GitHub as well. I should mention that
    the productivity front end for our work is Python. Our users really use Python
    within Jupyter Notebooks – very similar to any Python developer. We're doing all
    of the hard work to be able to bring in a supercomputer in the back end to make
    it seamless, so that you don't need a heroic programmer. You don't need to even
    know that there's a supercomputer back there.
  sec: 1655
  time: '27:35'
  who: David
- line: We're trying to democratize supercomputing and make it easy. We are leveraging
    an open source compiler framework called “chapel,” spelled C H A P E L, that Cray
    developed under a DARPA program about 20 years ago, and is now supported by HPE
    that acquired Cray recently. So the HPE/Cray Chapel compiler is the framework
    that we're using in the backend to be able to run, whether we're on a laptop,
    on a cluster or a supercomputer – we're able to leverage this compiler framework
    to get truly high performance for the backend, where we do all of that hard work
    so that our user can just call a Python function and get the result and not even
    know all of the complexity running with a supercomputer in the back end.
  sec: 1655
  time: '27:35'
  who: David
- line: I guess the difference between a typical startup and a research lab is that
    you actually have a research lab, right? You need to publish papers and you keep
    your research open. This is really good, because not every startup company would
    just open source their know-how.
  sec: 1749
  time: '29:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's right. We're very much like a startup in that we have to acquire funds
    for supporting our research lab and students. And we are also pushing out code.
    But our real deliverable is producing students who are educated and able to contribute
    in the workforce and also the papers that disseminate our ideas. Those are the
    prime deliverables that we have.
  sec: 1772
  time: '29:32'
  who: David
- line: I have been involved with startup companies, so I've seen also from the other
    side, creating some new value and entrepreneurship. I’m quite excited by the work
    that I've done either advising or launching startup companies as well. So I love
    both sides. I love the academia side where everything's open, and I also love
    the motive of startup companies, taking some new idea and getting it to the market
    and really impacting people's lives.
  sec: 1772
  time: '29:32'
  who: David
- header: Finding (or creating) good datasets
- line: You mentioned that you need to work with datasets that terabytes in size.
    In our community, we have a course about data engineering and sometimes it is
    a problem for us to find a good dataset for a project. Can you recommend some
    of these datasets? You mentioned that there are system logs data sets? Are these
    datasets even open? Are there good open datasets?
  sec: 1830
  time: '30:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Most companies and organizations have massive datasets. Often, what we do
    in the research lab is either use synthetic data sets that we create or use some
    of the repositories online, where we find datasets that model social networks
    or other types. For instance, in our work, we look at graphs – and Stanford has
    a very good set of datasets called SNAP that has graph datasets. We use many of
    those.
  sec: 1858
  time: '30:58'
  who: David
- line: But if you work with a company, or any organization, they'll have terabyte-sized
    datasets and we're trying to train people to use those. I don't imagine that they're
    going to be opened and given to researchers. I think we have to go to them. In
    the past, what I used to do is create our code on synthetic datasets, and then
    work with companies by taking my code to the company and then running internally
    on their datasets.
  sec: 1858
  time: '30:58'
  who: David
- line: It's a challenge to find a dataset that looks like datasets from industry
    – not something pre-cleaned and already a CSV file, like with all the data in
    one CSV file, compressed, and it's like two megabytes. But rather something that
    looks like real-world messy data. That's a difficult thing to find.
  sec: 1920
  time: '32:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. That's hard to find within academic research, but very easy to find
    within industry, in large organizations. We often work with many organizations
    that have these types of massive, massive datasets.

    I have about three PhD students, about two or three Master's students, two or
    three undergrads, and then about two or three high school students as well. [cross-talk]
    The boundary between our summer semester and our fall starts and so I have some

    in graph analytics. Right?
  sec: 2038
  time: '33:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's right. I should mention that that's my current lab, but I have quite
    a large number of alumni who've gone on to the bigger and better things. Some
    are faculty at other universities, some are working in major companies like Google
    and Microsoft and Facebook, and some are doing startups. I have students who are
    now across many different sectors and geographically all around the world.
  sec: 2048
  time: '34:08'
  who: David
- line: So I guess there is this natural cycle. A Master’s student comes and then
    they spend two years working at the lab, some of them stay as PhD students, but
    I guess most of them go and apply for PhD in other universities and then you have
    some PhD students coming in from other universities. So you have this natural
    cycle of people coming and working for a couple of years and then leaving, and
    then new people come in, right?
  sec: 2076
  time: '34:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's right. As a research lab in a university, I'm used to a very dynamic
    and changing workforce. I maintain a very diverse set of students and I have them
    (as I train them) for usually just a couple of years. Maybe a Master's student
    up to two years, a PhD student maybe three to four years, and then they go up
    and take the next stage of their career, whether it's in school or doing research
    at a company or university.

    just wondering – how much time do you spend on teaching versus doing research?
  sec: 2139
  time: '35:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a great question. Because I'm research active, I usually teach just
    a couple of classes per year. Normally… maybe I would estimate about a quarter
    of my time is spent on teaching. As mentioned earlier, I direct an institute for
    Data Science at NJIT, and I have four centers and one research thrust that report
    to the institute. There's about 40 faculty around NJIT that are part of those
    centers. We have activities related to the Institute.
  sec: 2149
  time: '35:49'
  who: David
- line: For instance, a weekly Virtual Data Science Seminar that gets broadcast through
    YouTube. We have other activities to bring students and faculty together. So that
    takes quite a lot of time. And then I have my own research as well, in my research
    group. I do a lot of service. For instance, right now I'm the editor in chief
    of the ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing, and some other service roles that
    take my time as well, whether it's inside NJIT, or for the betterment of the broad
    computing and data science communities.

    rewarding research project for you that you have done?”
  sec: 2226
  time: '37:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: What is the most important research project? [Alexey corrects] Oh, most rewarding,
    sorry. Most rewarding. That's a great, great question. Huh. I’ve done so many
    research projects. Maybe I'll mention my highest-cited paper. It is one on finding
    an algorithm for the linear time distance between sign permutations. Let me just
    describe this a little bit more in laypersons terms. There's something called
    the “pancake flipping problem,” where you have a stack of pancakes of different
    sizes, and you want to count the minimum number of times you can put a spatula
    into the stack and flip them over to sort them from biggest on the bottom to smallest
    at the top. This problem was one that Bill Gates actually worked on when he was
    an undergraduate student at Harvard with Christos Papadimitriou. He opened the
    door for solutions for looking at this problem.
  sec: 2234
  time: '37:14'
  who: David
- line: Many years ago in my career, I looked at a very similar problem related to
    this, where instead of a single stack of pancakes, you actually have a circular
    stack that you're putting two spatulas in and then flipping sections. That's called
    an inversion and it's a very useful mechanism in biology, looking at evolutionary
    histories. So I worked on this problem and the algorithms from the best theoreticians
    were extremely complex, some head running times, like order n4, order n3. And
    as I worked on this problem, we discovered that you could solve this problem in
    just a couple lines of code in linear time – true linear time – and it was very
    easy to implement. The only data structure it used was a stack.
  sec: 2234
  time: '37:14'
  who: David
- line: This problem was something opened by Bill Gates and we closed it – and we
    did it in such an elegant and simple way. So that's one of the most rewarding
    examples that I have of being able to work on a problem that many others have
    worked on before, but getting that spark – getting that innovation – that takes
    a problem that used to be really, really complex, and making it almost trivial.
    That paper has been cited hundreds of times now, and it’s just a delight for me
    to see that we can still improve things, even if they seem like others have worked
    on it and got so far, there may be a different way of solving things, or there
    may be a new thought and we can make these big discoveries. To me that work is
    something that I really found rewarding to do.
  sec: 2234
  time: '37:14'
  who: David
- header: David’s most underrated research project
- line: I guess when people appreciate and cite your paper, that's good. But sometimes
    it happens that you put a lot of effort into something, you really liked the outcome,
    but people just don’t notice it. Or maybe like one or two researchers cite it
    and then that's it. Are there papers like that, which you wish more people knew
    about?
  sec: 2429
  time: '40:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Another great question. One of the works that we've done, it's been cited
    a number of times – it received the Best Paper award at the IEEE HPEC conference
    (high-performance extreme computing) – and it was work that we did on a framework
    called STINGER. STINGER stands for Spatial Temporal Interaction Networks and Graphs.
    Essentially, this was a foundational paper looking at analytics when your data
    is in motion and you can form that data into a graph. We described one of the
    earliest processing frameworks for streaming graphs.
  sec: 2453
  time: '40:53'
  who: David
- line: I believe the paper is now about 10 years old and we have had a lot of developments
    since, as we ported that work to GPUs and accelerated it, it became a package
    called a Hornet, and then cuGraph that you'll find in, for instance, NVIDIA’s
    RAPIDS AI framework for data science. The graph analytics are actually based on
    some of our work with STINGER. I've been quite excited by that. It's been somewhat
    of a niche, looking at streaming graphs, I think they were a little bit ahead
    of their time. Now, it's become mainstream to look at graphs and especially streaming
    datasets. But I really enjoyed that work and working with the students, as well,
    that helped make it possible.
  sec: 2453
  time: '40:53'
  who: David
- line: I think this is actually an emerging topic. If you think about cybersecurity
    and like fraud detection, this is actually a graph, but then you get a stream
    of events and then you somehow need to build a graph from this stream of events.
    And you need to be able to do this fast – if there is a fraudster, you want to
    catch them as fast as possible. Is this how it’s used?
  sec: 2533
  time: '42:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. I've been involved with parallelizing graph algorithms since the
    1980s. I don't know if you even remember the 1980s or were born yet, but… [chuckles]
  sec: 2560
  time: '42:40'
  who: David
- line: I was at school in second grade. So I don't remember that. [laughs]
  sec: 2571
  time: '42:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: I've always been interested in graphs, but what has really taken off is the
    fact that there are tables and databases that you can't do a join of those tables
    because the space requirement really blows up. So we move to graphs because you
    could form a graph between relationships and your trading the table joins for
    traversing through vertices in that graph. There are many problems – as mentioned,
    from cybersecurity, from biology, from social network analysis – that are amenable
    to graph representations.
  sec: 2575
  time: '42:55'
  who: David
- line: There, what I do is take all of the raw data, which is really relationships
    and attributes about objects, and all of the objects become vertices in the graph,
    and the relationships become edges, and those relationships could have attributes,
    they could have timestamps, there could be directions on those relationships,
    there could be an ontology (or not) that's associated with it. But these graphs
    really give us a raw and natural representation for many things that we see in
    the real world. And so I abstract away our problems to graphs and then I solve
    the algorithm that we're looking for within a graph framework, then map it back
    to the application domain.
  sec: 2575
  time: '42:55'
  who: David
- line: But these graphs – we've been doing this, as I mentioned, for decades – it's
    now becoming mainstream as more data scientists realize the power of graphs. So
    I'm really excited by this shift and all of the frameworks out there that have
    given us great capabilities for processing graphs.
  sec: 2575
  time: '42:55'
  who: David
- line: Yeah, that's interesting that you mentioned that. Maybe you know, with deep
    learning – there were some researchers in the 90s that did some of the work on
    deep learning and nobody really recognized their efforts until it was actually
    the right time. Now (or like 10 years ago) people realize that there are these
    GPUs that could be used and then all of a sudden, deep learning became popular.
    Now these researchers who started the research way, way back – now they are very
    well-known. Probably the same thing is happening here. [cross-talk]
  sec: 2675
  time: '44:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's right. Everything comes full circle. I think it's cyclic and we see
    things rediscovered, and it's great. We have new capabilities now. I think what's
    also different from when I first saw neural nets in the 1990s, now that we see
    it, we have more computational capabilities and we have data sets that are available.
    Whereas before, we didn't have as much data. So I think we've had the perfect
    storm of data sets, computational capability, and then really bright students
    who are looking to do this type of research.

- line: We will make sure to include links in the description. I remember that I prepared
    a lot of questions for you. One thing I really wanted to ask you about is – I
    like teaching, but if I want to go to university and I want to work at the university,
    it feels like it's kind of expected that I also do research. You mentioned that
    you actually devote 25% of your time to teaching and the rest, I think, research
    and all these coordination activities. My question is, “Is it possible to join
    a university just to teach students? Or is university not the right place for
    that?”
  sec: 2812

    in research if I work at university? Or can I just work there and teach?
  sec: 2875
  time: '47:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Great question. There are many different types of universities. Some are research-oriented
    universities, where faculty are expected to do both research and teaching. But
    there are other universities that are focused solely on teaching. Many, many universities
    are like that as well. Some even focus just on undergraduate students.
  sec: 2885
  time: '48:05'
  who: David
- line: There are some students who get a PhD and go to a teaching school, where they
    teach undergraduate students. That's fantastic as well. We typically have a classification
    for universities in the US called the “Carnegie Classification.” There, there
    are research-extensive and research-intensive schools. But also we have teaching
    schools as well. There are ample universities – hundreds upon hundreds of universities
    of all of these different types.
  sec: 2885
  time: '48:05'
  who: David
- header: Staying up-to-date in research
- line: But I guess if you join a university just to teach, then what may happen is
    that in five or 10 years what you teach becomes obsolete, right? So you need to
    somehow know what's the cutting edge and that's why you need to do research and
    teach at the same time. Is that right?
  sec: 2941
  time: '49:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. In computing and data science, of course, everything becomes old
    quite quickly. I've had to relearn and reinvent every few years to stay on top
    of what it means to do computing. For instance, as an undergrad, for me in the
    late 1980s, probably none of that technology… We'd see it in a museum today. But
    the concepts are still very similar. So I've had to stay on top of the technology,
    but the foundations usually still remain the same. Still, when you're teaching,
    there are great ways to stay on top.
  sec: 2958
  time: '49:18'
  who: David
- line: You can read publications, for instance, from professional societies. There
    are typically journals and magazines that help you stay on top. You can also follow
    research, even if you're not doing it yourself. Usually, there are papers that
    are very accessible. I love to read and I love to stay on top of many different
    areas, because who knows what we'll be doing in five years from now? How the world
    could change – we'll be here and talking about quantum computing and new trends
    that are emerging as well.
  sec: 2958
  time: '49:18'
  who: David
- line: But how do you even find time to stay on top? Not only have you published
    300 papers, meaning that you are busy all the time writing these papers, co-authoring,
    managing students and so on – how do you even find time to read papers? I imagine
    that you need to read a lot of papers – far more papers than you write. Right?
    [chuckles]
  sec: 3037
  time: '50:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. So I'm sitting here, and I always have a journal next to me or some
    papers to read. You know, it's fun. I love reading and staying on top of it. To
    me, it doesn't feel like work. I can't believe that I get paid to do this. It's
    a lot of fun. It's exciting to look at what's happening out there. I often have
    my phone close by – I call up colleagues and see what they're working on. I will
    meet up with colleagues and ask about what their research is, even if it's in
    a completely different area, like architecture, or physics, or in the humanities.
    It's just great to be able to interact with others.
  sec: 3063
  time: '51:03'
  who: David

    I want to solve global grand challenges and do real-world problem solving. And
    that requires not just knowing everything in my niche discipline in computing
    and data science, but really knowing how the world works and what can I do to
    solve problems that really matter to people and populations around the world?

    I don't know… there is a conference, you open the schedule for this conference
    and see what's there? Or do you have some sort of mailing list that you follow?
  sec: 3133
  time: '52:13'
  who: Alexey

    favorite mailing list. Often, I'm trying to triage email to find the very important
    pieces to respond to versus the advertisements and this and that. But I typically
    read the general magazines. For instance, from the IEEE Computer Society, there's
    the IEEE Computer Magazine. And then from the ACM, there's Communications of the
    ACM. Those typically have some great summaries that will give me pointers to maybe
    papers in journals and conferences that are something to pay attention to.
  sec: 3148

    computing, high-performance computing, and I'll track what's happening. I'll attend
    some of those conferences. Now, it's easy being able to attend many things virtually.
    I'll scan the agendas and see what's interesting – what the trends are and what
    catches my eye. I just stay on top by trying to follow it. Again, it's a lot of
    fun. I have some books that I'd love to read. But I also like being able to read

    in that area. I'm often doing high performance data analytics and go to conferences
    like Supercomputing from the IEEE and ACM, or IEEE HPEC, which is high-performance
    extreme computing. And one of my favorite conferences is from the IEEE called
    IPDPS, the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium. That's
    been one of the longest-running conferences in parallel computing, where I have
    my main community there. There's other conferences as well. There's quite a lot
    that are blossoming in the area of data science, and I'm excited to see where
    those go as well.

    “Okay, this is actually something I can contribute to.” Or how does it work?
  sec: 3298
  time: '54:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a great question. Many faculty look at an area and say, “Hey, what
    can I do in this area?” I'm probably somewhat of an outlier, where I first want
    to find a person in another discipline who may be struggling and they don't have
    the computational capability or the data science tools that they need to solve
    their problem. So I first go to find “What's the need?” And then I really look
    at their domain in detail, and “How can I help enable them to solve their problem?”
    I think that's the way to have more impactful research, rather than just creating
    something that I'd love to do but maybe nobody else will be interested in.
  sec: 3307
  time: '55:07'
  who: David
- line: I always try to think about “Who needs this?” And “Can I help them?” Earlier
    in my career, I worked with geographers as well as with many computational biologists
    and those working on Genome Sciences, where they had datasets and problems that
    they'd like to solve, but didn't know how to do it. They didn't have the algorithms,
    they didn't have the right data structures – whereas I could help assist them.
    Through the course of my career, I've repeatedly been able to work with domain
    scientists and help them solve the problems that they have. By doing so, I get
    to publish some great computer and data science papers. But more importantly,
    I get to solve real problems, where it makes a difference to a scientific and
    technical committee out there.
  sec: 3307
  time: '55:07'
  who: David
- line: I guess that's the recipe of how to get such a long list of credentials like
    you have, right? Just start with a need, find somebody who’s struggling, find
    out what they’re struggling with and offer them tools, and then work together.
  sec: 3400
  time: '56:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's right. You know, at the start of my career, I thought it took longer
    to do my research. For instance, NASA, the space agency in the US – I did my PhD
    and I had a fellowship and worked on problems from NASA on satellite image processing.
    And I remember working on that problem, where there are a number of academic papers,
    but the academic papers cut corners and abstracted away from the real problem.
    I wanted to build a system that real NASA scientists would use.

- line: It took an extra effort to make sure that I was scientifically valid, that
    the results were quality checked and controlled, and that I was solving the problem
    – the real problem – not just a computer science abstraction that I could publish
    a paper on. It took a lot more to create the right interfaces and to really maintain
    all the science that was in that code. And I've had to do that multiple times
    in my career, when I build systems for biologists or others, where I really have
    to make sure that it's a system that has all of the corner cases, all of the complexity
    that's in the real data and the real problem, rather than just writing a paper
    that I can publish and put on my resume, but no one will ever use.

- line: And maybe the last question. I remember when I was a Master’s student, when
    I almost graduated, my professor called me to his room and said, “Okay, we're
    doing this cool research. How about you join us and work as a PhD student?” I
    thought, “Okay, the salary is not that great. How about I think for a couple of
    years and work in industry?” Then I did that and didn't come back.

  time: '58:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: As a professor, do you have this problem that you need to compete for students
    who are maybe motivated not by research, but by things like money? They don't
    stay in academia, they don't pursue a PhD – they just work on something like running
    SQL queries and calculating click-through rates.
  sec: 3491
  time: '58:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I love attracting PhD students to this research. That's why I'm here talking
    with you and I'd encourage anyone who's interested in this area to come seek me
    out at NJIT. You could do a Google search and find us. I'm looking for some great
    PhD students. There is always a competitive market for PhD students in research
    and there are many different areas that PhD students can work on. I've had PhD
    students that do their whole research with me. Others work with me for a few years
    and then they may find someone else where their research is more exciting – and
    that's great for them to find a research topic that they can do their dissertation
    on and then become the world expert in.

  who: David
- line: I’m always looking for fantastic PhD students. I have a great lab. It's very
    diverse. I've men and women and have been able to graduate quite a number of students
    over the years. I think, for students, there are a lot of choices to be made,
    especially for research and that there's probably a research lab for everybody.
    No matter what your interest is, you'll probably find a person that is working
    in that area. I encourage students to really look at the professors, rather than
    looking just at the university name – look at the professors and what research
    they're doing and decide, “Do you want to be an expert in that area?” And “Who
    can you apprentice with to do your research?” Again, there are many funded PhD
    positions that we have. Students are typically supported while they do their PhD,
    so they get a stipend and their tuition paid. So what better way could you do
    your graduate degree than a funded PhD position and come out and be the expert
    in your field?
  sec: 3549
  time: '59:09'
  who: David
- line: I have had my students go on and, as I mentioned, some are faculty at Penn
    State, at University of Florida and other places. And others who are now leaders
    at research at major companies where they're really the thought leaders. So it's
    exciting. I should mention, I was an undergraduate student when I first did research.
    I got involved as an undergraduate with a faculty members research program during
    a research experience for undergraduates. And that's when the bug hit me. It was
    like, “My gosh! This is so fun!” I had no idea what research was until I spent
    a few summers working with that faculty member. I'd encourage all students to
    think about a research experience, find a faculty member that you think their
    work is interesting, and see if you can work in their lab. I'm sure that they
    would love to have you and I think once you touch research and you see research,
    maybe it will lead to a lifelong career.
  sec: 3549
  time: '59:09'
  who: David
- line: The example I gave you at the beginning – of my professor talking to me and
    trying to sort of convince me to stay – do you need to do this? Do you need to
    compete with industry? Or you don't have this problem because there are enough
    motivated students – not necessarily from your group, but coming from elsewhere,
    who want to join your group?
  sec: 3722
  time: '1:02:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a great question. Often our Master's students are with us for about
    a year or two and many of them go to industry. A few will continue on for a PhD,
    either at their current institution or another. But the PhD students typically
    want to get a PhD because that's the entry level to be a researcher within some
    of the top industries and companies. We work with many companies that want to
    recruit our students, but they want them at particular levels.
  sec: 3746
  time: '1:02:26'
  who: David
- line: They may not want to take the PhD students before they're completed to make
    sure that they have a PhD versus the Master’s students, who are more readily accessible
    to industry. I haven't really had to compete against industry. In fact, often
    we collaborate with industry, finding shared research topics that our PhD students
    can do. What better way to train them so that when they do get their PhD, they
    have a company that's ready to hire them and continue that research? It's really
    more collaboration at the PhD level than a competition with industry.

    Thanks for the chat. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, for asking questions.
    I didn't cover two questions. My apologies for that. But I think we will stop
    now. I just want to thank you again, David, for joining us today, for sharing
    your experience. For me, as somebody who is working in industry, this is an entirely
    different world. Now I have some idea of what exactly you do there in academia.
    That was very interesting. Thank you.
