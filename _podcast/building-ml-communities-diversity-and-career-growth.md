description: Discover how to build and scale a data science community, boost diversity, deploy ML, and accelerate career growth with mentoring & hiring strategies
intro: 'How do you build and scale a data science community that actually advances diversity, supports machine learning deployment, and accelerates career growth? In this episode, Dânia Meira — AI Guild co-founder, data scientist, teacher and speaker with a Master’s in Computer Science (AI) — walks through her journey from applied math and marketing analytics to founding a global data science community in Berlin. <br><br> We cover practical community building: turning women’s meetups into monthly dinners and an international membership, curating meetup content and the Datalift Summit, and policies like visibility-first speaker invites, codes of conduct, and misconduct response. Dânia explains why diversity (gender, nationality, neurodiversity) improves product fit and market reach, how to create psychological safety, and how to source and train diverse talent for regulated industries. She also outlines a vendor-agnostic consulting model for machine learning deployment, community-to-client matching, and scaling from a freelance network to full-time teams.'

- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: 'Guest Introduction: Dania — AI Guild co-founder, machine learning background'
- line: This week, we'll talk about diversity and leadership in data science and AI.
    We have a special guest today, Dania. Dania is a co-founder and director at the
    AI Guild, where she works with companies scaling data analytics and machine learning.
    She has been a senior expert and mathematician in the field since 2012, doing
    machine learning for predictive analytics and focusing on marketing use cases.
    Welcome to today's interview, Dania.
  sec: 94
  time: '1:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. Thank you very much, Alexey, for inviting me. As you mentioned,
    I have known you for some time and this is the first time that I am on your channel,
    so it's pretty cool.
  sec: 121
  time: '2:01'
  who: Dania
- line: Yeah. I've been on your channel a couple of times – at least two, I think.
    It was about time I returned the favor. It should have been done a long time ago.
    [chuckles] Sorry it took so long. The questions for today's interview were prepared
    by Johanna Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, for the help. Let's start.
  sec: 131
  time: '2:11'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Early Career: Applied math, Spark vs Hadoop thesis and marketing analytics'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of adoption of AI and diversity, let's start
    with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 152
  time: '2:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I studied Applied Maths for my Bachelor’s. When I finished my studies,
    I moved from my hometown to Rio de Janeiro (this is all back in Brazil, where
    I was born) and I worked three years as a marketing analyst. Also, at the same
    time, I was doing a Master's in computer science. When I finished my Master's,
    this was 2015, I did my thesis in recommendation systems, motivated by the use
    cases I saw in marketing with personalization. Also because at the time, there
    was this big data processing framework called Spark, (maybe you know it). At the
    time, it was Spark 1.0 replacing Hadoop. I basically wrote a thesis comparing
    the implementation with Spark and Hadoop.
  sec: 163
  time: '2:43'
  who: Dania
- line: Fun times.
  sec: 214
  time: '3:34'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Move to Berlin: Startup roles and building end-to-end data skills'
- line: Yeah. At this point, I was finishing my Master's, and I was thinking about
    working abroad. It happened that by chance, I got approached via LinkedIn for
    a job as a data scientist in Berlin. It was a perfect match. They were looking
    for someone with my experience exactly – working with data and predictive modeling
    for customer behavior analysis. They offered me the job, they sponsored my visa,
    and then in September 2015, I moved to Berlin.
  sec: 216
  time: '3:36'
  who: Dania
- line: The first three years of working in Berlin, I was in fast paced environments,
    international environments, startups, also with smaller data teams, which meant
    that even though my official job title was data scientist, I did a wide range
    of different tasks. I did data engineering jobs, connecting to my previous knowledge
    with Spark, but I also worked on analysis and I built Tableau dashboards. For
    sure, I did a lot of machine learning, mostly for forecasting and prediction tasks.
    It was a great time to learn all those different skills.
  sec: 216
  time: '3:36'
  who: Dania
- line: I think that helped me build a good foundation in the end-to-end data science
    work. Also, it was good for me to understand what my strengths were. I enjoyed
    a lot of this. At the time, I didn't quite plan to move to Berlin specifically,
    so I was dealing with these personal challenges like learning German and understanding
    how life works here in Germany. But it was all about discoveries, I would say,
    at the beginning of my career.
  sec: 216
  time: '3:36'
  who: Dania
- header: 'Role Evolution: Data scientist generalist to specialized career paths'
- line: It's interesting how it's a bit different now with the data scientist title.
    When I started my career “data scientist” meant many different things. I also
    got to do analytics, data engineering, machine learning (obviously). But now,
    it's more focused, I guess. Maybe at startups data scientists might still do all
    these things, but I think at bigger companies – we have machine learning engineers,
    we have data engineers, we have data scientists, we have data analysts. I think
    it's more focused right now. It's a bit harder to be a generalist right now.
  sec: 319
  time: '5:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I agree. I think that at the beginning, it was also easier to be a generalist
    because there were not so many tools like we have now. Now, with the tools, it's
    easier to get started in a specific area, like data engineering, for example.
    Then from there, you can really develop your expertise and go deep into the areas
    of engineering instead of going into deep learning, for example, which would be
    very different with different tools.
  sec: 358
  time: '5:58'
  who: Dania
- line: So you worked with startups and then you did something else, right?
  sec: 388
  time: '6:28'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Teaching & Mentoring: Bootcamps, Data Science for Good, and skills sharing'
- line: Yes. Then I started to understand what I wanted to do, and I really wanted
    to focus on machine learning. Also, given my background in applied math, I really
    enjoyed the modeling aspect. I moved to work in a German company that was more
    structured, but then I also helped a lot to create the definition of the role.
    I think this is also one of the things I saw during my career in the past years
    – the evolution of the field also translated somehow in the evolution of my own
    personal career and what I could contribute to the organizations I was working
    for to come up with those better defined rules, understand what the tools that
    the field was starting to use were and make it a standard tender. For example,
    now we see that there is consolidation of using Cloud tools.
  sec: 392
  time: '6:32'
  who: Dania
- line: Even for deployment, we see that there are a lot of companies using the same
    tools, like Docker and Kubernetes. This kind of thing started to come up as I
    changed to another job and then started implementing this. I think that this was
    the time that I also started to learn that I enjoyed teaching a lot, because I
    was supporting my junior colleagues in growing to their roles and to understand
    what the scope of the projects was and how we could split the tasks based on the
    strength of each one on the team. I was also teaching at a data science boot camp
    at the time. I did this besides my full time job. I also did some volunteer work
    at Data Science for Good Berlin, which helped me to get to know other people working
    in data science, to exchange work practices, and to really understand in which
    direction things were developing.
  sec: 392
  time: '6:32'
  who: Dania
- line: You said you worked at a boot camp as an instructor?
  sec: 508
  time: '8:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly.
  sec: 512
  time: '8:32'
  who: Dania
- line: I wasn’t sure. I know your profile on LinkedIn and I remember that you were
    an instructor. I just didn't hear this time if you were an instructor or a student.
    Was it first that you started as a student and then became an instructor? Or was
    it immediately?
  sec: 513
  time: '8:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I was just an instructor. I mainly did a SQL crash course for weekends.
    I did this for two and a half years. I also supported other classes like Git or
    Bash Scripts, but the main one that I was teaching was always SQL because it's
    also the first thing I learned at my first job as soon as I graduated. I was a
    marketing analyst and the job was basically to get data from SQL and build reports
    or build analyses or do simple regressions. I felt like this was not at all covered
    in courses at universities. Now you have a lot of online courses, but back in
    2012, Coursera was not a thing yet.
  sec: 529
  time: '8:49'
  who: Dania
- line: I think when Coursera started… I don't remember any SQL courses. I think there
    are now, but back then I think you had to learn on the job. You also mentioned
    Git and Bash scripting. I think this is what many new data scientists struggle
    with and you were helping them with these things.
  sec: 573
  time: '9:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think those are things you learn on the job, but you could be prepared.
    I also learned those on the job. When I started as an analyst, I didn't work with
    developers, but as soon as I started working as a data scientist, I worked a lot
    with backend developers. They were writing proper code and they were doing code
    review and I was like, “Okay, I’ve never done this before.” Even when I was at
    university, I learned how to do all of that in theory, but you work on your thesis
    basically on your own. Maybe your professors check in on your stuff, but it's
    not like when you're doing collaborative work with a team, where everyone is developing
    in the same base code. I learned the importance of that.
  sec: 593
  time: '9:53'
  who: Dania
- line: I was lucky that I had very good colleagues that had a lot of patience with
    me. I picked up the skills and then, as soon as I saw the importance of it, I
    was like “Okay, we need to spread this knowledge. Maybe even the awareness that
    this is important is not in people's heads.” It kind of helps you be faster and
    it helps you also adapt to the new workplace if you already know the tools that
    they're using. And those are quite standard tools.
  sec: 593
  time: '9:53'
  who: Dania
- line: I want to ask you about the AI Guild, but I'm wondering if we're missing anything
    before you started that?
  sec: 668
  time: '11:08'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Community Origin Story: From women’s meetups to a broader support network'
- line: Yeah, I think we have a good link because that's when I was doing Data Science
    for Social Good and when I was teaching at the bootcamp – it was when I started
    to get to know more people working in the field. I started learning that all the
    challenges that I had in my work was not only me, it was not only my company.
    There were some common struggles that we shared. One easy or very straightforward
    thing is that there are not a lot of women in the field, or at least I didn't
    know a lot of women.
  sec: 677
  time: '11:17'
  who: Dania
- line: I had a few colleagues, but then I had questions like, “Can I find more women
    working in the field? Where are they? Let’s reach out to other networks and see
    if we can learn how to support one another – support more women entering the field.”
    All of this kind of started this community or this network idea. We just got together.
    For example, when we started with the women group, we started getting together
    in a company where one of us worked and we had sessions where we were just talking
    about our stories and what it is like to be a woman in that particular company,
    what kind of tips you can share, etc.
  sec: 677
  time: '11:17'
  who: Dania
- line: Fast forward to 2018, that’s when we really broadened the circle. We found
    more people that wanted to work towards the same goal and to really embrace this
    aspect of gender diversity at this point. Then we started talking about other
    challenges in data science work. For example, we want to have more impact on business.
    There were many instances where we shared projects and proofs of concept, but
    they would not be used – they would not get deployed. There were many aspects
    involving all of this. The more that we shared about those challenges, the more
    we learned from each other's failures and also learned what we could do about
    it.
  sec: 677
  time: '11:17'
  who: Dania
- line: Then we started doing this as an official community. We did monthly dinners,
    initially, in Berlin. We were maybe 20-30 people getting together, but we did
    end in frequent waves. We would bring the same people every month and invited
    new people to join. We also started to understand that this came together as a
    support not only for the technical challenges, but also as career support. We
    kind of translated into this question of, “Okay, do we have different career paths?
    How do we grow in our own career?” The idea of the AI Guild community was to put
    people together and to find solutions for those challenges. My point, I think,
    was to create an environment that was welcoming, and one that allowed us to talk
    about our experiences, because I didn't have a solution, or I don't have a solution
    yet – but I think that if we put our minds together and discuss the topic, we
    can move forward. It was really about helping each other and helping our ecosystem
    grow.
  sec: 677
  time: '11:17'
  who: Dania
- line: We officially launched the AI Guild in May 2019. We created a logo, we launched
    the website and now our mission is really to advance AI adoption. That's the point
    – we want to talk about our good experiences but also about our bad experiences.
    People know that it's a space where they can ask questions and they can seek help,
    because other people in the community have been through similar things. We learn
    from each other, we grow together, and we hope that by sharing the lessons learned,
    it's also a way to fast track other people's careers.
  sec: 677
  time: '11:17'
  who: Dania
- line: You still have these dinners, right?
  sec: 917
  time: '15:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 919
  time: '15:19'
  who: Dania
- line: Every month?
  sec: 920
  time: '15:20'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Community Growth: Monthly dinners, global expansion, and membership scale'
- line: Yes. We started with the dinners and then we had COVID, so we went to online
    meetings. But since last summer, we went back to the dinners in person. Now we
    have grown outside Berlin – we are a global community. We have over 2000 people,
    but mostly based in Europe. Then it’s upon the members in the city to organize
    the dinner. For example, here in Berlin, I am one of the co-organizers. We get
    together with this idea of really networking and getting to know each other, and
    meeting every month so you gain trust in the other people that you meet.
  sec: 921
  time: '15:21'
  who: Dania
- line: Cool. I was at one of your events, which was during COVID times, which is
    when we got to know each other. I think it was exactly this, where people were
    talking about good and bad experiences. In Particular, you mentioned the link
    between a POC and deployment. I think this was one of the topics that we discussed
    back then. So you do that and you also mentioned another thing.
  sec: 963
  time: '16:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: You're also doing career sessions. You talk about career challenges, like
    going from academia to industry, right? That's one of the things you cover? [Dania
    agrees] I also know that you did a conference last year. Is that right?
  sec: 963
  time: '16:03'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Datalift Summit Origin: Organizing the first in-person conference post-COVID'
- line: Yes. There's a lot going on. Yes. The monthly dinners were how we started.
    We always had the idea to get people together in a bigger group. We have the local
    dinners, but what about one big event? One where everyone travels to Berlin, which
    is where we started, and gets to know each other? We finally managed to do it
    for the first time last June. It is the Datalift Summit. It was really, to me
    at least, a big surprise. At the same time that we wanted to do it, since we started
    in 2019, we were not sure about how this was going to work. Especially considering
    that it was just post-COVID – online events became the norm and it was comfortable.
    You get to know people from doing these kinds of calls online or watching them.
  sec: 1005
  time: '16:45'
  who: Dania
- line: You never met in person, right? We should fix that. [chuckles]
  sec: 1057
  time: '17:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we were like, “Do people really want to meet in person? I don't know.
    Maybe we're still a bit afraid.” People are starting to get shots for the protection
    of everyone. We were like, “Okay. Let's do it in summer, because then we can do
    it in more open spaces. Maybe it's safer. Maybe by then more people get access
    to the vaccine.” And yeah – we sold out. We had 300 tickets. We sold out all the
    tickets. It was really amazing to see how the community was looking forward to
    being together in the same space and meeting face-to-face. It was a huge learning
    experience for me in terms of how to organize this. I had never organized anything
    in-person. But I really had an easy time finding speakers, because in our community
    people really want to share what they have been through and their knowledge.
  sec: 1059
  time: '17:39'
  who: Dania
- line: This was the easy part – finding a speaker was the easiest part. I had more
    than 50 speakers. We were also not sure if people would want to join the event,
    but two months before the event, we were able to sell all the tickets. It was
    a really nice get-together – a cool atmosphere for people that were both entering
    the field, but over 40% of our audience was people in the mid-level of their careers
    – between years two and three. We also have a lot of people who have over five
    years of experience. Maybe they are even founders of their own startups. So there
    was a good match for people that wanted to get career advice and people that maybe
    are looking to expand their team.
  sec: 1059
  time: '17:39'
  who: Dania
- line: Are you doing the Summit this year?
  sec: 1163
  time: '19:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. We are doing it again this year in Berlin in June. Now I can do a plug.
    We still have cover speakers open until the end of this month – end of February
    2023.
  sec: 1167
  time: '19:27'
  who: Dania
- line: Yeah, so if somebody wants to speak – hurry up. [Dania agrees] I should also

    topics'
- line: Okay, cool. I want to go a little bit back to the time when you said that
    you noticed that there are not a lot of women in the field and you wanted to reach
    out to more women. You started organizing meetups in one of the companies where
    you worked, where you had sessions where you talked about different challenges.
    I wanted to ask you, what did you discuss regarding these challenges? What were
    the topics? How did you come up with these topics?
  sec: 1191
  time: '19:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. This is something that started as my own curiosity. I was kind of selfish
    – I wanted to find answers for myself, in my career. I think this is what everyone
    does, maybe not intentionally, but you look up to other people. You see what they
    have done and you think, “Okay, could I do the same if I want to be where this
    person is?” And I couldn't really find a woman that was successful in the field
    of data science around here in Berlin. It was not easy to find. Because if I could
    see this person, I would go up to them and ask them, “How did you do this? I'm
    going through this, do you have any tips?” That was the first thing that motivated
    me. How can I do it for myself? I didn't really find someone specifically, but
    I found a lot of other women that were also around here and they had different
    experiences.
  sec: 1224
  time: '20:24'
  who: Dania
- line: For example, I was working as a full time data scientist. But there were people
    that were teaching, people that were volunteering, so that's also what I started
    to understand. You could do this besides your full-time job. There were other
    people that were freelancers and there were others that were founders. The first
    event that we did was really “career options”. That was the title, Career Options.
    I put together a panel where I was the interviewer. I had my own questions, so
    I created an event to ask them my own questions about the careers that they chose.
  sec: 1224
  time: '20:24'
  who: Dania
- line: It was really to talk about, “What is it that you do? Why do you think that
    you chose this career?” We had someone doing research, someone doing freelance,
    someone working full time as a team lead. It was really about, “Tell us about
    what you do and why did you choose this career? What can you tell others, maybe
    the pros and cons of choosing this career?” It became a discussion. From that
    first one, we learned that there were a lot of other things that people wanted
    to know. We decided, “Okay, let's have a list of different topics, and then each
    month, we can do one of those topics. That's how it started. I really wanted answers
    for myself.
  sec: 1224
  time: '20:24'
  who: Dania
- line: That's a very nice way to find answers, right? You organize a panel and then
    you find people who have answers, and you ask them.
  sec: 1363
  time: '22:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: We were really happy to do this for other women because we don't see so many
    women in the field – maybe one or two, and then another person, and another one
    or two. With that, we got to 30. That was pretty good.
  sec: 1375

  sec: 1390
  time: '23:10'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Diversity in Berlin: Internationality, gender balance, and workplace culture'
- line: Yes, I do. I think at my last full-time job, we had a team that was 50/50.
    We had the same amount of men and women, for example. But yeah, I have been to
    job interviews in which I got interviewed by only men. I don't know. It feels
    different. I don't think it's only gender diversity. This is the main point –
    I think it's easy to see – but what I think is also unique here in Berlin is the
    internationality. We have people from different countries that live here together.
  sec: 1395
  time: '23:15'
  who: Dania
- line: Especially in startups, people come to Berlin to work here and the language
    is English, but you can hear people maybe speaking Spanish in one corner, people
    speaking Russian in another corner. And we're all here. I think this creates a
    very welcoming environment, where you don't feel like you're the outsider – everyone
    is an outsider and we're all together in the same boat.
  sec: 1395
  time: '23:15'
  who: Dania
- line: That's the beauty of Berlin. You can feel at home, even though it's technically
    not your home. [Dania agrees] I guess one thing is, like you said, the situation
    improved and you had 50/50 gender representation at one of your last companies,
    but maybe because this is how you chose companies? Could this be the case?
  sec: 1451
  time: '24:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: For sure, yes. As I mentioned, I had been to interviews in which I only had
    male people interviewing me. There was one that was really strange. This was back
    in the time that you had to go to the company to interview and all the people
    that I saw there were nonfemales, and I was like, “Do they even have a women's
    bathroom? Because there's only guys here.” But yeah… I think this has to do not
    only with the company that I chose, but also maybe how the company positioned
    itself. Maybe this is dependent on your gender or your background or nationality,
    but also the culture, or the work environment, the atmosphere itself. That could
    be more welcoming to people that have different ways of thinking. Diversity is
    also in this way. For data science, we have diversity of backgrounds, like people
    that study economics or computer science or psychology can be working as data
    scientists. But also there’s different ways of thinking.
  sec: 1476
  time: '24:36'
  who: Dania
- line: So, “diversity” here means many things. Gender diversity is one visible aspect,
    but there is also diversity in nationality – we all come from different places
    in the world. And then there’s also background diversity – some people come from
    physics, mathematics, some people come from computer science, some people come
    from economics, some people come from social sciences, etc. and this is another
    aspect of diversity. Are there other aspects? I guess these are the main ones,
    right?
  sec: 1548
  time: '25:48'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Broader Diversity Dimensions: Backgrounds, nationality, and neurodiversity'

    But yeah, those are more specific topics, or even more difficult to address.

  time: '26:19'
  who: Dania
- line: What is that?
  sec: 1592
  time: '26:32'

    could be, for example, introverts or they could be in some spectrum. Yeah.
  sec: 1594

  who: Dania

  sec: 1605
  time: '26:45'
  who: Alexey

    to do work, or even that they communicate to others that might not be the norm,
    or what we know as the norm.
  sec: 1609
  time: '26:49'
  who: Dania
- line: I'm wondering, what are the pitfalls? Why can't I just go to the University
    of Berlin and hire all white dudes from the computer science department, from
    the same group, to work on this? Just take all of them and have them work? Isn't
    this enough to have a successful company?
  sec: 1619
  time: '26:59'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Business Case for Diversity: Inclusive teams, product fit, and market reach'
- line: Yeah, I think it could be enough at some point. I don't think that it is not
    successful. But I do think that there is a limitation when you do that, because
    you are basically building something for the world and the world is a diverse
    place. You're building something that addresses only one group – that is the group
    that built this. It's hard when you don't experience the world through the lenses
    of others, so that you don’t perceive what it is that they are facing and how
    they understand the world – what challenges they have and what solutions they
    would enjoy.
  sec: 1639
  time: '27:19'
  who: Dania
- line: That is one aspect. But also, if you really think of it coldly, as a company
    that is trying to sell more and make more money, then you want to broaden your
    audience. On the other hand, you also don't want to exclude anyone. You're basically
    missing the business opportunity when you just do something for a specific group.
    You’re doing something from a specific group that addresses only one specific
    group.
  sec: 1639
  time: '27:19'
  who: Dania
- line: That's the main advantage of diversity, right? You usually don't build for
    a specific group, so you need to have different opinions – different voices in
    the team. Somebody can say, “Look, this is actually strange. Why did you do this?”
    And then you start a discussion and something happens at the end.
  sec: 1704
  time: '28:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. Again, it's not only about having those people, like hiring
    them on paper, but really about creating this environment in which everyone can
    collaborate, where people feel that they are heard, that they can speak out, and
    then this exchange starts to happen. Then things start to come out. Because it's
    really hard for you to understand what other people are going through when you're
    not having their experience. For example, there is one reported thing in the book
    called Lean In, from the former COO of Facebook. She used to be like the right
    hand of Mark Zuckerberg and she's a woman.
  sec: 1727
  time: '28:47'
  who: Dania
- line: Before she was ever pregnant, she writes in her book that they did not have
    any special parking spaces in the office for pregnant women. This never happened
    to go through her mind or through Mark's mind. That was it. And then she became
    pregnant and she was going to work normally and then she realized that she had
    her own spot because he was the COO – the second most important person in the
    company. But then other women were having to find a parking spot wherever (far
    away) and then walk all the way to the building, which meant more stress for them
    and also with the weight of the baby, it really becomes something that makes a
    difference in your day.
  sec: 1727
  time: '28:47'
  who: Dania
- line: It got pointed out, because someone was late for a meeting or something. They
    said, “Yeah, I didn't want to take the stairs, so I had to wait for the elevator.
    I came from this other building, because my car was there,” and so on. And this
    led to this realization like, “Yeah, I have been through this and I am a woman.
    I should have known better.” But it never crossed her mind because it was not
    her experience. But someone was able to talk to her about it because she was also
    pregnant. They were like, “Yeah, I don't have a specific parking space that is
    for me, so that I don't have to walk so much.” It's like, “Okay, then we have
    to change it.”
  sec: 1727
  time: '28:47'
  who: Dania
- line: Of course, as a COO, she could change the policy and she could make an amount
    of parking spaces available. But this is the kind of thing that will only come
    up when we talk about things and talk about our challenges and really point out
    “What about this? What about that?” Again, I don't think anyone has a right answer,
    but just by discussing this, we can figure out something that is probably more
    complete, or addresses more people.
  sec: 1727

- header: 'Psychological Safety: Leadership signals and enabling open conversations'
- line: How do you create this environment? An environment in which I can approach
    a COO and not be afraid of asking about these things, or feeling comfortable discussing
    these things with your colleagues, who are not from the same background as you?
    With males, for example. How do you do this, especially when there are a lot of
    males with a computer science background? It must be difficult.
  sec: 1884
  time: '31:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think it's not something that just happens. It's not something that
    happens overnight, as well. I do think it takes deliberate war work and it takes
    time. The first thing I would say is to communicate, or the leaders at least,
    should clearly say, “We want to hear from you.” They need to express that this
    is something that they're open to. Also, the best example, I believe, is an example
    by doing. As a leader, if you start sharing, then maybe others will feel comfortable
    sharing back. As a person that is from an underrepresented group in our field,
    I don't feel comfortable most of the time to just raise my hand and say things
    like, “This is wrong. You need to fix this.”
  sec: 1918
  time: '31:58'
  who: Dania
- line: It's really about sharing and it's like, “This is how I experience this and
    this is how it makes me feel. And maybe there's a way that we can improve it.
    And maybe I have ideas, because I have been treated differently in different spaces.
    I could bring my good and bad experiences.” But also I don't think that demanding
    things is the right way to do it. It’s about really engaging in a conversation
    and, specifically, if you are in a position of power, to do it yourself and make
    sure that people know that you are open to this. I think it may start with one
    or two people, but as long as new people join and see that this is the atmosphere,
    then they won't have this fear from the beginning.

    these sessions, where you wanted to connect with other women in the field, and
    then eventually it grew to dinners and then the Guild itself. This was probably
    one of the very important aspects of the Guild. You wanted to make it diverse
    and you wanted to have different people in the community. Do you help companies
    recognize that and build such an environment, where everyone's opinion is welcome?
  sec: 2023
  time: '33:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Recruitment & Training: Sourcing diverse talent pools for regulated industries'
- line: Yes. It is something that we discuss in our community, like “How could we
    approach organizations?” As individuals, we can only do so much. We have our own
    limitations based on our roles inside organizations. That's when we decided –
    we had a survey from our members at the guild – how we could address this together
    with businesses. Most of the people decided to do a for-profit organization, which
    is consulting. This is the work that I do full time – supporting the community
    but also funding the community through B2B consulting. We don't do diversity-based
    consulting, but our focus is really about deployment, so machine learning to production,
    understanding companies and where they are in this journey, let’s say from proof
    of concept to production. That is not only on the technical aspects. We do some
    consulting based on the models or the data pipelines or the architecture.
  sec: 2061
  time: '34:21'
  who: Dania
- line: One feedback we got from a company client is that they like doing this with
    us because we are diverse in the aspect of technology. We are not a vendor. We
    are not trying to push one specific solution – we are vendor-agnostic, we are
    independent consultants. In that way, we could explore a diversity of solutions.
    But then there is the aspect of needing people to implement all of this. You need
    to hire and you need to maybe structure a new team or expand a team you already
    have. That is the aspect where we can then talk more about this aspect of diversity.
    For example, one of the previous clients we had was a consulting company in Germany,
    for a very traditional area – in finance. That means, traditionally, it’s a lot
    of Germans and especially males.
  sec: 2061
  time: '34:21'
  who: Dania
- line: We were doing recruitment and training for entry-level data rules. Our goal
    was to have a group that was at least 40% women. This is also our gender policy
    for the Datalift event – for example, the one we were doing in June. We say 40%
    because we also don't want to have only women. The point is to be diverse. We
    also had a goal to have at least 25% of people that were non-natives, even though
    one of the restrictions for the role is to speak fluent German or German at a
    proficient level, because of the nature of working in finance – having a lot of
    legislation and so on.
  sec: 2061
  time: '34:21'
  who: Dania
- line: Must be a tricky one.
  sec: 2235
  time: '37:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, we really had to look into different talent pools, let's say. Like you
    mentioned, maybe we don't go to just one university, we go to different universities
    that also have programs that are taught in English, and then people come to study
    in English, and then they learn German when they are here. In the end, we had
    very good results. We didn't really have the final say. In the end, the decision-maker
    was the company that was hiring them. We were only doing the recruitment and training.
    But we managed to find a pool of ten people in which five were women. From these
    ten people, eight more non-native, so we had mostly international representation
    there. I was really happy about that.
  sec: 2237
  time: '37:17'
  who: Dania
- line: Okay. How did you approach this? I mean, this one is a tricky case – when
    you need to find people who are fluent in German in Berlin. I guess that’s not…
    [chuckles]
  sec: 2290
  time: '38:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: That was not in Berlin. This was in Hamburg, but still in Germany. But yes,
    some people were not… the training happened in Hamburg and they had to be there
    for the training, but they didn't want to move to Hamburg. Maybe they were also
    in different places, because the work itself would be done remotely.
  sec: 2304

    as cosmopolitan as Berlin, but still.

  who: Alexey

    I was on a meetup recently – PyData meetup. It was maybe 14 people and only two
    or three women. I don't remember. This particular sample is maybe biased, since
    not everyone goes to meetups. If you look at the general population, maybe things
    are better now than they were five years ago, but still – where do you find women
    if you want to have a diverse team?
  sec: 2334
  time: '38:54'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Visibility Policy: Inviting women speakers first to increase participation'
- line: Yes. Again, this is something that you have to do intentionally. It won't
    just happen. What I can share is the policy we have for our events, which is that
    we invite women first and we invite women to be on stage. We make it visible to
    women that could be attending that there will be other women – at least the speaker.
    This is something that I have been through already. You go to a meetup because
    you're interested in the topic, and you arrive there and it's only a bunch of
    dudes. You're like, “Okay, who can I talk to?” Sometimes you don't want to be
    approached in the wrong way. It's tricky.
  sec: 2376
  time: '39:36'
  who: Dania
- line: Also, it's hard if you're doing it for the first time and you don't know anyone.
    As a woman, I can say that it’s really good when you know that there's another
    woman going, so maybe you can ask a colleague, like, “I'm going. Let's go together.”
    Maybe if you know that the speaker is a woman, then you know that at least you
    can approach her towards the end. That helps. This is something that we also did
    for the training. Also, when I participated at the boot camp, I was hired by one
    of the women teaching, because they wanted to have more women applying.
  sec: 2376
  time: '39:36'
  who: Dania
- line: Putting women in visibility roles gives visibility in general for anyone applying
    for that event, or for that initiative, in a way that they know that firstly,
    they will not be the only one. And secondly, it also sends the message that the
    organization cares about this, because they are making it visible. I think it's
    the same for all the other underrepresented groups, not only for women.
  sec: 2376
  time: '39:36'
  who: Dania
- line: And this is something you did at the AI Guild from the very beginning? I guess
    at the beginning, it was even only women, right?
  sec: 2478
  time: '41:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Before it was called the AI Guild, we had this women’s meeting. But then when
    we called it AI Guild, I brought all the women from this women’s meeting, and
    that, in the beginning, made it really equal – 50/50. As we grew, it started to
    grow a lot more on the male side, so it became unbalanced. So the way to fix this
    or try to keep it up was that I intentionally invited women. Every woman I got
    to know in the field, I invited to the AI Guild personally. This is something
    I still do everywhere I go. I also try to attend other events from groups dedicated
    to women, for example, Women in Machine Learning and Data Science, or PyLadies.
    Those are safe spaces for women.
  sec: 2486
  time: '41:26'
  who: Dania
- line: When you go there and you present them with the opportunity to speak, for
    example, they also have those communities for encouraging women to go to those
    visibility roles to really step up in their careers. So when you go there, you
    can tap into this pool that is being prepared for it and it becomes easier as
    well. But the policy is that we invite women to be speakers and we invite women
    first, so that we can fill some roles with women. Then it becomes easier when
    we invite more women to speak since they're already women speaking. It's like
    a snowball effect.
  sec: 2486
  time: '41:26'
  who: Dania
- line: Yeah, that's smart. I’m wondering – we're talking here not about gender diversity,
    but diversity in general. If somebody is a part of an underrepresented group and
    they get promoted, or take the next step in their career, how can they take on
    leadership roles? Do you have any suggestions or any advice for them?
  sec: 2575
  time: '42:55'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Growth Advice: Networks, visibility, and stepping into leadership'
- line: Yes. I think a good way, or at least one of the ways I did it – I'm still
    on the journey right now and I don't have all the answers – but one of the ways
    I found really helpful for me to grow in my career, is to find other people. Find
    a network. You don't have to do it alone – you are not alone. There are others
    there that maybe share the same challenges or have been through similar things,
    and you can learn from them. Also, once you have some experience, you can also
    help people that are in the beginning of their careers. There is always this exchange
    aspect that I think helps.
  sec: 2601
  time: '43:21'
  who: Dania
- line: The other thing is to not be afraid to be visible. Maybe you go to the meetup,
    there is no other moment, and then you never go again. Then maybe next time, when
    you don't go, another one goes. So if you just keep on going or reach out, invite
    people, then it starts building this snowball effect. But you really have to step
    up and keep doing it until it grows. That's why I said it takes time and it's
    also not something that will just happen. You need to do something more, like
    invite others or even be a speaker so you are visible and others see you and come.
    I think those are the most practical things to share.
  sec: 2601
  time: '43:21'
  who: Dania
- line: But also, on another level, more for organizations – maybe you want to look
    for organizations that already have leadership that is more diverse, or that are
    working towards making this visible for their brands. There are some companies
    that are visible for having a diverse or more collaborative workspace where you
    can find out about this. I believe those would be the best ones to start with.
  sec: 2601
  time: '43:21'
  who: Dania
- line: One of the things you said is to not be afraid of being visible. I guess for
    that you need to have the right environment. Maybe you don't want to be visible
    in some environments. I guess this is something for the meetup organizers – to
    make sure that the environment is welcoming for people not to be afraid to be
    visible. And this is something you did in the AI Guild, right?

    leader in the initiative, you should have a code of conduct. With the code of
    conduct, it's really about describing what the expected behavior is inside your
    initiative and what the unexpected behavior is and what the consequences of the
    unexpected behavior are.
  sec: 2736

  who: Dania

    wanted to protect the environment in a way that it’s pleasant for anyone and people
    are also excited to go there, because you know that it's not only about people
    sharing the good parts, but it's also about sharing the bad parts and sharing
    what we learn. It becomes more real.
  sec: 2736

    websites – something that people do just because they have to? I might be wrong.
    I know, in your case, it was different because you thought of this from the very
    beginning. I'm not saying others do this as a checkmark, but I imagine that it
    can sometimes be like that. I’m guessing it's not enough just to have a code of
    conduct.
  sec: 2783
  time: '46:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: You have to have the code of conduct and live the code of conduct. For example,
    when we thought about it, there is a famous one – the Berlin code of conduct.
    We started from this one and we took it as an example. It's published online and
    a lot of the meetups (even on meetup.com, for example) say that our event follows
    the Berlin code of conduct. The idea was to take from those examples and also
    from our own experiences, what we expect from people. When they, let’s say, go
    to an AI Guild dinner – what is unacceptable behavior and what are the consequences?
    And how can people report this behavior?
  sec: 2810
  time: '46:50'
  who: Dania
- line: Then it becomes tricky when you are there at the meetup and then you see someone
    doing unacceptable behavior. What do you do? Now, as the community organizer or
    the leader, you really have to address it. You cannot run away from it. You cannot
    hide from it. By hiding from it, for one, you're giving permission to this unacceptable
    behavior. People that were there maybe won't want to join anymore, because they
    experienced this. But you're also saying that it's just like a checkbox. It happens,
    unfortunately. I have to say that this did happen.
  sec: 2810
  time: '46:50'
  who: Dania
- line: We had to deal with unacceptable behavior and we also had to make clear that
    this was not acceptable and tell the person to never come again to our events.
    It's hard, because you also want to give people a second chance. Maybe people
    are not aware. There are some specific cases where you really have some values
    or have maybe some lines that cannot be crossed. In the end, what you are doing
    is really protecting the environment, so that people can keep enjoying this and
    leveraging the community for what it was made for, which is exchanging experiences
    and knowledge.
  sec: 2810
  time: '46:50'
  who: Dania
- line: I guess it's really tricky. As an organizer, you need to understand, “Okay.
    Did this person really cross a lot of lines so they cannot show up anymore? Or
    maybe it's not a hopeless case and we just need to speak and explain that this
    is not acceptable?” How would you do this? Maybe you don't want to kick them out?
    Maybe they are just not aware? Because we are all coming from different backgrounds,
    from different cultures, and in some cultures, some behavior might be okay or
    at least not frowned upon. It’s tricky, right?
  sec: 2930
  time: '48:50'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Responding to Misconduct: Reporting, case-by-case handling, and consequences'
- line: This is a big challenge. We were talking about this diversity aspect in terms
    of culture or nationality. In different countries, you have different behavior
    that is accepted or not accepted. That's what I mean with the hardline. Some things
    you don't accept. If someone is yelling or cursing at others – that is global,
    right? But some things are more subtle and you never know. As the person that
    is receiving it, you also don't know what the intent was. Maybe the person didn't
    have the intention, but it was bad.
  sec: 2970
  time: '49:30'
  who: Dania
- line: It's not easy. I think it's case by case, that we need to understand. But
    one thing that definitely helped was when we got reports of the same behavior
    from the same person towards different people. This was not a one-off behavior.
    It was someone that was doing it with different people throughout some period.
    That's when we said, “Okay, it's worth talking to this person. But at this point,
    there was a lot of damage done already.”
  sec: 2970
  time: '49:30'
  who: Dania
- line: At least in my experience – I did need to deal with this in real life, but
    in Slack, quite often. I didn’t think about this when starting a Slack community.
    The reason we actually had to have code of conduct was that there was inappropriate
    behavior. How could we point to this person that this behavior is inappropriate?
    Of course, we need to have these guidelines – this code of conduct. Yeah, it's
    tricky.
  sec: 3042
  time: '50:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: At some point we even discussed if everyone needed to sign it. When you apply
    to become an AI Guild member, you apply, and we just want to protect the community
    from people that are not in the field, like recruiters. So we did this signup
    form, but we also thought, “Should we ask people to sign or to check that they
    read the code of conduct?” In the end, we said, “No, it's more about if you want
    to be active and participate, you will read it. If you don't read it, then it
    was always there.” It's your part as an active community member to be aware of
    it.
  sec: 3078
  time: '51:18'
  who: Dania
- line: If you do something that you were not aware of, because it didn't read it,
    then it's really on you. We trust everyone. We start from this based on trust
    – that people really want to be part of a community and they don't want to be
    toxic and break the community. I don't think anyone is doing that intentionally,
    but still, so you can always refer to the code of conduct and see maybe what is
    expected and what is unacceptable.
  sec: 3078
  time: '51:18'
  who: Dania
- line: My own experience is that even if you point to the guidelines 100 times, very
    few people actually read it. But I think in your community it’s different, because
    it grew from in-person events, rather than just a Slack community where everyone
    can join. Spammers don’t read the code of conduct. [chuckles] They just come to
    spam.
  sec: 3140
  time: '52:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. You offer people the opportunity to read it, but they will
    only read it if they want to. You cannot force them.
  sec: 3164
  time: '52:44'
  who: Dania
- line: Yes. Like this license agreement, right? When you install something or accept
    cookies or whatever.
  sec: 3170
  time: '52:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, you accepted it. So if you didn't read it, then you cannot complain
    afterwards. [chuckles]
  sec: 3178
  time: '52:58'
  who: Dania
- line: Yeah. I wonder how many people actually read these license agreements.
  sec: 3183
  time: '53:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was in at least two or three conversations about having some sort of AI
    to go through it and transform it into human-readable stuff. Or at least summarize
    the most important things because yeah – no person reads everything.
  sec: 3189
  time: '53:09'
  who: Dania
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah. And these privacy policies are the same thing.'
  sec: 3207
  time: '53:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. That's why in our code of conduct, we really tried to make
    it practical, like, “What are examples of things that you shouldn't say? What
    are examples of things that you cannot say in any case? And if you see someone
    saying it, what can you do?

- header: 'Community-to-Client Matching: Leveraging member expertise for projects'
- line: I wanted to talk a bit more about the Guild. Right now, you're a for-profit
    organization and you offer consulting. So how does it work? Companies approach
    you saying, “Hey, we want to deploy some models.” Help us.” Something like that?
  sec: 3228
  time: '53:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. The idea is really that we are first a community and we want to exchange
    experiences. And from that, we also learn a lot from our members. The idea is
    that when someone is having some issue, they can come to us, through the members
    maybe or because they attended one of our events. They can come to us and we can
    come up with some offer for a solution that will address what they're looking
    for. Then, because we are part of this network of more than 2000 people, we can
    basically guarantee that we will find someone with the expertise that you're looking
    for inside our network.
  sec: 3253
  time: '54:13'
  who: Dania
- line: For the community, for the members themselves, they have opportunities to
    contribute to the project. Some people are freelancers, so this is all they do,
    but even for people that work in full-time employment, as long as it's allowed,
    they take on some trainer roles, or advisory roles. That way, we have the contribution
    for specific challenges that companies are looking for.
  sec: 3253
  time: '54:13'
  who: Dania
- line: So the community members do the work? You have a pool of specialists, experts
    in certain areas, and there are companies who need some experts and you match
    the demand and supply, right?
  sec: 3317
  time: '55:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, most of the time. I'm working full time, so when it's about my own expertise,
    then I can deliver the projects. But, for example, this last one was in finance,
    banking and payments and this is not my area of expertise. Therefore, I could
    find people in the community that have worked in banks that have done, for example,
    fraud detection cases and then they were the ones that were advisors.
  sec: 3334
  time: '55:34'
  who: Dania
- line: Okay. So you work as a consultant. This is your full time activity right now.
    [Dania agrees] How many people are like you, who consult for the guild full-time?

  sec: 3383

    else.
  sec: 3385
  time: '56:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Ah, yes. Okay. It's based on our previous experience. I am mostly focused
    on machine learning and Chris is mostly focused on the career aspects. He was
    a director of a bootcamp before and he is the one that mostly does the transition
    from academia to industry. He takes the lead on that. And then, on machine learning
    and data analytics, I do the technical part of the project, but also the teaching.
  sec: 3391
  time: '56:31'
  who: Dania
- line: So what Chris is doing is upskilling people in a company if they need to help
    with learning the new tool or whatever, right?
  sec: 3422
  time: '57:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, and we do that for our members as well. We have events that are free
    to attend for our members. We are mostly doing it in Berlin, but also understanding
    where other members are in terms of groups so that we could put them together
    in the room and discuss the career topics. The idea is to do career coaching.
    There are two groups. The first group is people that are starting their career
    (meaning until 3 years of experience) and the other one is for people that are
    already seniors, and looking to grow to leadership roles, such as the Chief Data
    Officer role. For that, Chris mostly takes the lead on the sessions to understand
    where people are and what they could do to improve their career growth.

    and cannot cope with the numbers because there are just two of you?” How do you
    do this? Do you start finding somebody in the community to delegate work to?
  sec: 3476

    and project-based, but if it turns into regular income, then we can hire people
    full-time to do it with us.

  sec: 3516
  time: '58:36'
  who: Dania
- line: Another question from Azif is, “Can you tell us more about the structure and
    hierarchy of your company?” But I guess if there are just two people, you don't
    really have a lot of structure. [chuckles]
  sec: 3518
  time: '58:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Basically, we do everything and we work together with freelancers or project-based
    people, as I mentioned. But the idea is that Chris takes on the lead on the career
    topics, and I take the lead on the use-case topics.
  sec: 3528
  time: '58:48'
  who: Dania

    recommend to the listeners?
  sec: 3542
  time: '59:02'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Recommended Resources: Weapons of Math Destruction and Coded Bias'
- line: Yes, I want to say that the book I always recommend is about the impact of
    not having enough diversity working in data projects. It’s called the Weapons
    of Math Destruction.
  sec: 3551
  time: '59:11'
  who: Dania
- line: “Math” as in mathematics. Right?
  sec: 3566
  time: '59:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. The idea is that each chapter is a different example of how
    harmful or somehow math was applied in a discriminatory way because of different
    aspects. Maybe the data was biased, or maybe the application itself is just wrong.
    This book is by Cathy O'Neil, and she is also someone that is championing this
    idea of unbiased AI applications. Together with this, she was also in a documentary
    that was on Netflix and I forgot the name.
