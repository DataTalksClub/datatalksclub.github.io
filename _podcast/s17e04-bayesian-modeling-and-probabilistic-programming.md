short: Bayesian Modeling  and Probabilistic Programming
title: Bayesian Modeling  and Probabilistic Programming
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about Bayesian modeling and probabilistic programming.
    We have a special guest today, Rob. Rob is a machine learning engineer and a data
    scientist. He's interested in deep generative models, as well as good statistical
    models. Previously, he was a research scientist at Indiana University, where he
    worked on the Hakaru probabilistic programming language. Sounds Japanese, right?
  sec: 104
  time: '1:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes!
  sec: 127
  time: '2:07'
  who: Rob
- line: Sudoku Hakaru. [chuckles]
  sec: 129
  time: '2:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah. It's actually a verb. Hakaru means “to measure”. It was a system
    that actually took measured spaces with modeling events seriously. The name also,
    in some sense, advertises unique features of the library.
  sec: 131
  time: '2:11'
  who: Rob
- line: Only if you speak Japanese (or understand it).
  sec: 153
  time: '2:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Rob
- line: '[chuckles] Okay. The questions for today''s interview were prepared by Johanna
    Bayer. Thanks, again, Johanna, for your help. Let''s start.'
  sec: 156
  time: '2:36'
  who: Alexey
- header: Rob’s background
- line: Before we go into the main topic of Bayesian modeling and probabilistic programming,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 166
  time: '2:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. I basically started as a fairly regular software engineering and
    computer science person. I went to LA, worked in different startups and was getting
    involved just as machine learning was kind of really having… I don't want to say
    a renaissance yet, but it was starting to really pick up. What do I mean by that?
    What I mean is, open source machine learning tools were actually getting good.
    Because before, I would say, 2006–2007, lots of machine learning tools were very
    hit or miss. You had some nice stuff in the R ecosystem and you had libraries
    like OpenCV and…
  sec: 176
  time: '2:56'
  who: Rob
- line: '[inaudible] Have you ever used it?'
  sec: 235
  time: '3:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: But there really weren't… SciKit Learn was essentially only created in the
    late 2000s. It was actually very hard to do good machine learning work readily
    well. It was all researchers, so everyone was essentially just rewriting all the
    algorithms from scratch all the time. But they were starting to get pretty good
    and I was very much really engaging with machine learning. But I was often finding
    that a lot of the kinds of problems I wanted to work with didn't always fit things
    like SciKit Learn or things that you could just throw a random forest at.
  sec: 237
  time: '3:57'
  who: Rob
- line: So I got interested in Bayesian modeling. Through that, an opportunity showed
    up so I could work with a former university professor of mine, Ken Shawn, in Indiana.
    Over there, I did work on probabilistic modeling (Bayesian modeling) tools. Through
    that, I really came to really love and appreciate the power and flexibility of
    these tools. From there, I went and did a PhD program at Oxford, where I worked
    on more deep Bayesian modeling, so very much VAE sorts of things. After that,
    I moved to Berlin to kind of move back into industry to start actually applying
    these tools. In some sense, I was motivated by…
  sec: 237
  time: '3:57'
  who: Rob
- line: The problems I cared about with a lot of these tools are things that are very
    challenging to work on the side – they really are research problems that require
    dedicated time. I became very motivated to see these tools get widely adopted,
    and I also just enjoy solving actual problems. A lot of my trajectory has been
    this back and forth, where I sort of pop into industry, dip into academia, pop
    back into industry, pop back into academia. With this, I try to kind of push the
    technology forward.
  sec: 237
  time: '3:57'
  who: Rob
- line: You said you were… How did you phrase it? “A usual software engineer/computer
    science person”?
  sec: 390
  time: '6:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 398
  time: '6:38'
  who: Rob
- header: Going from software engineering to Bayesian modeling
- line: I imagine that for a usual computer science/software engineering person, when
    they see all these mathematical formulas from the Bayesian modeling, they just
    freeze or freak out or whatever. I remember, for me, it was like, “Oh, all these
    integrals. I don’t understand what's happening here.”
  sec: 400
  time: '6:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did it happen for you? Was it easy for you to get into the field with
    your software engineering/computer science background? Or did you have to do a
    lot of extra work to be able to work and not be afraid of all these formulas?
  sec: 400
  time: '6:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I might be a little bit not the typical case, because I always had a
    love for machine learning and AI. I kind of always knew that I'd need to be comfortable
    with integrals and things like that. There are some people who were software engineers,
    they were used to making things like web servers and mobile apps, and then they're
    like, “Calculus?! I thought that was useless. You mean this math I was taught
    in secondary education is the most important thing I could have known? Why did
    my teachers not say that?” I didn't quite… [cross-talk]
  sec: 443
  time: '7:23'
  who: Rob
- line: I think they did. [chuckles] They did say that.
  sec: 490
  time: '8:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: If I wanted to use these methods, I had to at least be somewhat comfortable
    with optimization methods and linear algebra. There's kind of no way to do that
    without being at least a little comfortable with taking a few integrals, taking
    a few derivatives. So it was less of a challenge in that regard.
  sec: 492
  time: '8:12'
  who: Rob
- line: Did your job as a software engineer…? As I understood, you started your career
    as a software engineer, and then you transitioned to more Bayesian stuff? [Rob
    agrees] Did your work as a software engineer involve mathematics, or was it creating
    websites and doing backend stuff?
  sec: 515
  time: '8:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no. It was very much doing things like “Scrape data from the web, clean
    the data, put it in a database.”
  sec: 536
  time: '8:56'
  who: Rob
- line: So fairly standard software engineering.
  sec: 550
  time: '9:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Not so much as even calculating a median.
  sec: 552
  time: '9:12'
  who: Rob
- line: Okay. [chuckles] So you kind of kept your, if I can call it “mathematical
    muscles” fit by doing some extra stuff, or did you just like mathematics so much?
  sec: 557
  time: '9:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was just dabbling. You're just sort of dabbling in the problems, you're
    reading about them. Because in some sense, if you're like, “Oh, I want to learn
    machine learning. Okay, I'm going to learn how to run a random forest or implement
    it.” You just sort of spend a lot of time on the side getting comfortable with
    things, making little programs.
  sec: 572
  time: '9:32'
  who: Rob
- line: This was back when there weren't these very beautiful boot camps, which really,
    I think, try to structure a lot of this knowledge. So I was just dabbling. I've
    told this to people – I've never taken a formal statistics class. Ever. I never
    did. I just basically kept buying statistics textbooks until I felt comfortable
    enough with the ideas.
  sec: 572
  time: '9:32'
  who: Rob
- line: Interesting. For me, I remember my first formal machine learning class was
    a bit of a shock – maybe not a bit of a shock, but actual shock. It was at TU
    Berlin. The professor started with Introduction to Bayesian modeling, with a lot
    of integrals and… the things we talked about, like marginalization, he just assumed
    we knew all this stuff. It was like, “Okay, what am I doing here?” [chuckles]
    But I decided to stay and see what happens. It was a good decision. But yeah,
    it was… It was scary.
  sec: 624
  time: '10:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: For you, from the university times, you liked mathematics. You were curious
    about that. You were reading statistics textbooks. This is how you kept your mathematical
    skills, right? For you, this transition from software engineering to more mathematics-heavy
    stuff was not uncomfortable. Right?
  sec: 624
  time: '10:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. I was already reading these things like, “This is how you marginalize.
    And this is…” [cross-talk]
  sec: 692
  time: '11:32'
  who: Rob
- line: I guess this is why you transitioned, right? Because you wanted to do more
    of that stuff – not scraping.
  sec: 698
  time: '11:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, in some sense I kind of already did, but… This was the thing where it
    was, at that point… Thinking about 2006, 2007, 2008 – there weren't machine learning
    engineer jobs. That wasn't a thing that existed. There were analysis jobs. But
    this idea that you will be in a tech company doing machine learning was…  Those
    jobs existed here and there. They might exist in Google, if you want to help with
    spam finding or working on the ranking algorithm.
  sec: 703
  time: '11:43'
  who: Rob
- line: That was a job where you use machine learning, but you'd be basically hired
    as a software engineer. You can sort of still see it in the culture of a lot of
    companies that haven't really come back and reflected on roles. It's just that
    they hire software engineers, and then they hope they can teach you statistics
    later. That's a culture that I think still persists quite a bit.
  sec: 703
  time: '11:43'
  who: Rob
- line: I'm pretty sure about that. I see that [as well]. Then there is an opinion
    that it's easier to learn the math you need than the engineering. So it's easier
    to hire an engineer and then teach the math (the basics), and then let them work
    on ML, rather than getting them in the position to be able to engineer. I don’t
    know if it's true – I've seen good people…[cross-talk]
  sec: 770
  time: '12:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It’s not clear if it's true, because I've gotten to experience the opposite,
    which is – you have a bunch of, to put it bluntly, unemployed physicists that
    know the math, and basically are taught software engineering. In my personal experience
    – they do just fine.
  sec: 794
  time: '13:14'
  who: Rob
- line: I'm sure that if you know all the… Physics involves a lot of mathematics,
    right? All this gravitational stuff. The variety of symbols there, and Greek letters,
    and all that stuff – it's even scarier than integrals, right? And they understand
    all that. If they understand all that, and can make sense of that, and spend five
    years defending PhDs about that – for them, learning Java is not that difficult.
    Right?
  sec: 813
  time: '13:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Right. It feels like it’s such a silly… I don't know. I suspect that
    the reason this attitude is taken is more because software companies are run by
    people who used to be software engineers. That's what they value. So their attitude
    is, “Software is what I know, so software is not what I expect to teach. Statistics
    is something I don't know. I kind of had to dabble and learn. So that's what I'll
    expect from the people I hire.” I feel like it actually just flows downstream
    from those kinds of unstated values.
  sec: 842
  time: '14:02'
  who: Rob
- header: Frequentist vs Bayesian modeling approach
- line: What is Bayesian modeling? What are we talking about today?
  sec: 883
  time: '14:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Okay. Yeah. Also, I've been saying the words “probabilistic modeling”
    and “Bayesian modeling” – they're not quite the same thing. There are differences.
    If you take a statistics class… Maybe this has changed. But if you take a statistics
    class, at some point… It feels a little bit silly to say this considering I've
    never actually formally taken one, but I read a bunch of textbooks that are used
    for these classes. So hopefully, I'm not coming off too presumptuous. Okay, let
    me say this – if you open up a statistics textbook, in the introduction one, they'll
    often say, “There are these different schools of how to do statistics.” What they'll
    basically say is that there's this sort of frequentist modeling approach and a
    Bayesian modeling approach.
  sec: 887
  time: '14:47'
  who: Rob
- line: My statistics class started with that, yeah.
  sec: 936
  time: '15:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay, good, good, good. Alright. I don't want to be like, “Oh, this is how
    class starts.” And everyone’s like, “No. No one does that anymore.” They shouldn't.
    But, you know. [chuckles]
  sec: 939
  time: '15:39'
  who: Rob
- line: It was a long time ago, though. But yeah, I confirm.
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: So they'll say there's frequentist modeling and there's Bayesian model. What
    do they mean by this? What they mean is, in a frequentist modeling approach, there's
    an assumption that you have a parameter that you're interested in. So you're interested
    in, say, something like annual rainfall in Germany. This is an actual quantity
    that exists in the world, but there's no way to directly measure that. But what
    you can do instead is measure things that are sort of noisy… the result of processes
    downstream of that.
  sec: 953
  time: '15:53'
  who: Rob
- line: You can do things like measure soil, or measure the increase of water in sewer
    systems. These aren’t annual rainfall, but these are essentially quantities that
    you can then use to estimate annual rainfall. There's, of course, some noise or
    some variants. A lot of what frequentist modeling is about is, “We're going to
    essentially do these data collecting processes for this, and then use that to
    estimate. Because there's some noise in that, we can't say this is what annual
    rainfall is. We’ll essentially give you a confidence distribution, meaning here's
    what we think it is and here are some bars of where we think the value is.” So
    you'll say things like, “We're 95% confident that the true estimate of annual
    rainfall will be between these two values.”
  sec: 953
  time: '15:53'
  who: Rob
- line: And frequentist statistics is nice in that regard, in the sense that these
    confidence values mean something. What they mean is, “If you do 100 experiments
    where you gather data and then estimate the rainfall, 95% of the time, your estimate
    will be between those two bars.” There's a really good guarantee there. But that's
    frequentist statistics, which I don't really do. [chuckles] But there's also Bayesian
    statistics. Bayesian statistics actually takes a very different attitude. In Bayesian
    statistics, there is no point estimate at any part of the analysis.
  sec: 953
  time: '15:53'
  who: Rob
- line: By “point estimate,” do you mean we make an experiment?
  sec: 1121
  time: '18:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: There’s just a number where you say, “This is what I think the annual rainfall
    is.”
  sec: 1126
  time: '18:46'
  who: Rob
- line: Yeah. So we get a number and this is our point estimate of the rainfall? [Rob
    agrees] And then we put some bars around it to say, “Okay, this is the interval.”
    So then it's still a point estimate, right?
  sec: 1129
  time: '18:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. There's a point estimate, and then there's a confidence interval around
    it. There are things that use distributions in frequentist statistics, but for
    Bayesian modeling, the fundamental object is a distribution. You almost never
    are doing anything with point estimates. Everything has a distribution. Before
    you even begin, you don't even talk about “Oh, I want annual rainfall.” You say,
    “I have a prior distribution. I have a starting distribution of what I think annual
    rainfall is.” What you then do in Bayesian modeling is collect data. And then,
    through basically applying Bayes’ rule, you end up with a posterior distribution
    of rainfall, given the data you've now observed. So it's always distributions
    – you're always working with distribution. What’s the advantage…
  sec: 1146
  time: '19:06'
  who: Rob
- line: So let's say I have some assumptions about the annual rainfall in Germany.
    I could have zero clue of what it is – it could be, “Okay, it's a uniform distribution
    between X and Y (some numbers).” I have no clue. But this is the starting point,
    right? [Rob agrees] And then I go and dig a hole and then measure something –
    I get some data. I go look into the sewers and learn some other variables, right.
    I collect data, and then from the flatline (from the uniform distribution) I start
    getting something else. This is what I do with Bayesian modeling.
  sec: 1221
  time: '20:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, with a Bayesian model, exactly. You would start with some examples like
    that. I would hope you wouldn't use a uniform, because you've collected some data,
    you've looked at some annual rainfall estimates over the years, and you said,
    “Oh, it seems that sometimes there's less, sometimes there's more.”
  sec: 1262
  time: '21:02'
  who: Rob
- line: It all depends on what kind of data we already have – what kind of knowledge
    we already have.
  sec: 1287
  time: '21:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, of course. But the important thing is that it's always a process from
    one distribution to another. Now, why would someone prefer that? It seems like
    more work. And it is work – doing this Bayes’ rule over and over again often involves
    computing a lot of these annoying integrals that are often not efficient. What's
    the actual advantage here? Because it's distribution in, distribution out, it's
    a very composable framework. It's very easy to extend your analysis and build
    up an analysis. Everything is just distribution in, distribution out. So it's
    very easy to sort of…
  sec: 1291
  time: '21:31'
  who: Rob
- line: Here's the thing – I have this distribution on data. That can be the starting
    point for a future analysis. I want to add more variables into the model later?
    I can start with this one, add in a little bit more data. It's very composable
    in that way, where it's very easy to sort of start from a simple analysis, and
    incrementally build into a more complicated one. Whereas, often, in frequentist
    statistics, you can't really do that – you often have to kind of throw away a
    lot of your old work. What this often leads to is, because you can build up your
    analysis, you can write tools that do this compositional work for you. It becomes
    much more amenable to these sorts of universal solutions where you can write a
    model, derive a sampler from it, and get to work. So in that sense, it's very
    useful in that regard.
  sec: 1291
  time: '21:31'
  who: Rob
- line: And how is it related to probabilistic programming?
  sec: 1421
  time: '23:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Probabilistic programming are effectively tools to make doing Bayesian modeling
    significantly easier by removing all of the tedious steps.
  sec: 1425
  time: '23:45'
  who: Rob
- line: The tedious steps are computing integrals?
  sec: 1440
  time: '24:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's computing the integrals, or approximating the integrals by sampling,
    it's figuring out which integrals you have to compute when you write your model
    – it's all these little steps that are sort of straightforward to do, but they're
    very tedious if you have to do them every time you make a little change to your
    model.
  sec: 1442
  time: '24:02'
  who: Rob
- header: About integrals
- line: Why is computing integrals such a big deal? Why don't we just compute them?
    What's the problem with them?
  sec: 1469
  time: '24:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: The issue with integrals is –if you go into your Introduction to Calculus
    class, there's this impression of, “You're going to write this integral, you're
    going to write this formula, you write an integral – Look, it has this nice clean
    form.” But, of course, the tragedy there is that this is actually not the common
    case. The idea that I could just write a function and get a nice integral from
    it, is not what actually occurs. They just don't often exist. In some sense, it’s
    the opposite of the case you have in derivatives, where there are very nice ways
    to automatically calculate derivatives. When you use PyTorch, you can just write
    a function and be handed, essentially, another function that computes the derivative.
    No such thing really exists in integrals. So, what people have to often do is
    approximate that. What do I mean by approximate? If you remember, when people
    talk about Riemannian, where you make these little bars, and then you sum the
    bars. People effectively have to do things like that.
  sec: 1479
  time: '24:39'
  who: Rob
- line: You mean compute the integral numerically, instead of computing it analytically,
    when deriving the formula [cross-talk]… You cannot do this because for some cases,
    there is no rule that you can apply here. So the only thing you can do here is
    just use numerical methods, which involves summing from one thing… I remember,
    usually integrals would be from minus infinity to infinity, and then you’re like,
    “Okay, how do I compute numerically? It can be computationally intensive. Correct?
  sec: 1562
  time: '26:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. But effectively, this is what we're kind of doing. We're going in,
    and computing numerically. Often, what happens when you're sampling – you're approximating
    an integral, because you're like, “Okay, I have this curve. I'm going to use probabilities
    to land on different parts of the curve and I'm going to count.” Effectively,
    by counting them, it's almost like building a histogram, right? You're making
    each of the bars, and you're counting where each of the bars are. A lot of times
    when you're sampling, you're essentially just approximating this integral. That's
    a lot of what the regime is. In Bayesian modeling, because most of these integrals
    are intractable, we devised the sampling methods.
  sec: 1600
  time: '26:40'
  who: Rob
- line: By intractable, do you mean that we cannot compute them on a piece of paper?
  sec: 1657
  time: '27:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: We can take a formula, get back another formula, and then, essentially, pass
    the bounds of integration and do minus and then repeat if we have nested ones.
    That's an option that really doesn't exist for the kind of integrals most people
    care about, sometimes provably so. If you look at some of the integrals that are
    involved for these probabilistic models, you're getting things like the error
    function. People are like, “What's the error function?” “It's this integral.”
    “Does have a closed form?” “We've never found one.” Or “We've proven that one
    can't exist.” Or “They use these nice set of functions.” So you have to do these
    numerical methods – you have no choice.
  sec: 1662
  time: '27:42'
  who: Rob
- header: Probabilistic programming and samplers
- line: Again, if we go back to our discussion of Bayesian versus frequentist – in
    frequentist, we get a number and then a confidence interval, and that's all we
    get, right? [Rob agrees] In Bayesian, on the other hand, we start with a distribution,
    we end with a distribution, but because we deal with distributions, we get all
    these nasty integrals that we have to deal with somehow.
  sec: 1715
  time: '28:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is why we use probabilistic programming – because otherwise, if we just
    directly use numerical methods to compute these integrals with these things you
    mentioned, like histograms, it just takes too much time. That's why we have approximation
    methods? To do it faster?
  sec: 1715
  time: '28:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Well, there's two things. One, without programs that do integrals,
    for every model, you have to essentially figure out what the sampler is going
    to be and then write it. If you make your model a little different, you have to
    change the sampler – you have to rewrite it.
  sec: 1757
  time: '29:17'
  who: Rob

- line: A sampler is a way to sort of figure out these integrals by basically… You're
    going to sample from the distribution in a particular way from the posterior distribution
    and that's essentially going to a bunch of draws, which you can then take the
    empirical average of. That's going to essentially let you approximate the integrals
    that are involved for…
  sec: 1780
  time: '29:40'
  who: Rob
- line: So posterior distribution is the result – the thing we're interested in. We
    cannot easily calculate it because there is no formula, so we need to somehow
    figure out what the value is, right? That's why we need sampling. There are different
    approaches for computing this integral These are the samplers. [Rob agrees] The
    Monte Carlo simulation is one of the possible samplers. Right?
  sec: 1810
  time: '30:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. What happens is… Sampling is its own challenge. What you quickly realize
    is, if you try to do this the naive way, most of your time – if you just said,
    “I don't know where my distribution is. I'm just gonna guess randomly and then
    check,” You will find that, particularly in high dimensions, most of your guesses
    are going to be in low probability regions.

    between zero and infinity, you might find that you often spend a lot of your time
    generating a guess that has low probability.
  sec: 1865
  time: '31:05'
  who: Rob

    slim chance that it's actually 1000. Regardless of what number I choose, the chance
    that I'm correct to still… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1883
  time: '31:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. You could use your prior distribution, like that uniform example, and
    use that as a guess. Then, you would essentially do a reweighting. That's better
    than guessing completely arbitrarily. But if you think about it, that’s just in
    one dimension. Now imagine in, say, 1000 dimensions or a million dimensions.
  sec: 1901

    not a bad guess for others. But if you're just guessing arbitrarily, the chance
    that you're going to pick a thing with reasonably high probability just goes down
    tremendously.
  sec: 1937

  who: Rob

    that we pick the rainfall for each of them correctly is non-existent. Okay, we

  sec: 1956
  time: '32:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right – as you keep adding, as you increase the dimensionality, the chances
    that you're gonna do okay… Of course, you can keep running samples and hope that
    eventually you hit high probability regions. But that takes computation time and
    [cross-talk].
  sec: 1972
  time: '32:52'
  who: Rob
- line: By running sampling, you mean something like, “Okay, we have these five cities.
    Let's just roll five dice.” We just open our NumPy and ask NumPy, “Okay, give
    us five random numbers between zero and infinity.” And we'll repeat until it's
    correct, right? That's what running sampling means?
  sec: 1990

    has this value, given the data we return?” So we have these probabilities there.
    But we can't know in advance what the high probability regions are going to be.
    There are tricks. You can sort of take the maximum – the maximum a posteriori
    of this function – and say, “Okay, what particular set of parameters gives me
    the top one?” But again, that's a point estimate. You still need to look at what
    the other likely values are. Also, the maximum a posteriori can be deceptive for
    lots of problems. All of these fancy sampling algorithms are all tricks to make
    it so that when you sample, you're likely to be sampling from a high probability
    region. That's where you get things like MCMC. What does MCMC do? It says, “Well,
    pick a starting point and make a sample from that.”

  who: Rob

  sec: 2100
  time: '35:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Markov chain Monte Carlo. So “Monte Carlo” because it's your sampling, it's
    gambling – you're throwing dice, and the “Markov chain” because each sample that
    you pick is dependent on the previous one. There’s this kind of Markov chain of
    all the samples. Why does Markov Chain Monte Carlo work fairly well, particularly
    high dimensions? Because you assume that your high probability points are near
    each other. So, for annual rainfall, if we think something like “50 centimeters
    of annual rainfall” is a good estimate, and has a good probability, we expect
    that 49 is not too bad either.
  sec: 2103
  time: '35:03'
  who: Rob
- line: You start there, and then your next sample is near there, and that you make
    a move that's in the region. In that way, you sort of hope to stay in the high
    probability regions of the space. You can say, “Well, this sampling algorithm
    has shortcomings, too,” so we make a better one, and so on, so forth. But the
    whole development of sampling algorithms is all for the purpose of getting points
    that are in high probability regions of the space without spending too much computational
    time doing so.
  sec: 2103
  time: '35:03'
  who: Rob

  sec: 2193
  time: '36:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, we didn't actually develop new sampling algorithms for Hakaru. We just
    took some of these algorithms that were out there and made them so that the users
    didn't have to run the algorithms. The user just ran the model, and they got the
    algorithms. That's the main thing that every probabilistic programming language
    is doing. It's just about letting someone talk about their model and writing the
    sampling algorithm for them.
  sec: 2199
  time: '36:39'
  who: Rob

    Java, there’s R, there is Python, there is Hakaru. Right? So you actually write
    code there. [Rob agrees] It’s an interpreter – a different environment. It’s not
    Python, right?

  sec: 2256
  time: '37:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. What we mean by that is – when we think about statistical models, sometimes
    you'll think about the Professor writing some notation on the board, saying, “I
    have some parameter – it comes from this distribution. If I see this value, it
    comes from this.” But if you just kind of pause and step back a bit and think
    about what a statistical model is – think about…  Let’s just keep using just the
    annual rainfall example. I might say, “I expect a certain amount of rainfall in
    a region just because it's in a particular latitude and longitude, and I expect
    some regional variation.” Why do I expect some regional variation? “Well, some
    towns are near a mountain and mountains affect things. Some towns are just maybe
    a little more south, so it's a little warmer, so they get more [rain].”
  sec: 2260
  time: '37:40'
  who: Rob
- line: If you think about how you would write that model, thinking about, “I have
    a loop, I iterate over cities, I have, if/can statements that I check, whatever
    mountain. Some of these parts of the model might be tedious, I might create subroutines.
    Oh my god, we have a programming language. This is clearly a programming language.”
    Just by virtue of trying to talk about what you're modeling, you inevitably are
    using a sort of language to do so. So from my perspective, the way we talk about
    modeling is the programming language. So what do we do with problems…
  sec: 2260

  who: Rob
- header: Language vs library
- line: In the same sense that we can say SciKit Learn is a programming language because
    there are… What's the difference between a library and a programming language
    is, I guess, what I’m trying to ask.
  sec: 2368
  time: '39:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, that's a very beautiful question. If you talk to some people out of
    the University of Utah or some of the racket scheme people they'll say, “This
    distinction between a library and a language is not very black and white. There
    is a little bit of an in-between.” So I think the distinction can be a little
    bit… But I'll make the case that there's this notion of “ifs” and “subroutines,”
    and “looping primitives,” these are things that we associate with languages, not
    libraries. A looping primitive isn't a thing you use within SciKit Learn, it's
    the thing you use within Python, which you then call “SciKit Learn From”.
  sec: 2378
  time: '39:38'
  who: Rob
- line: So when we talk about a statistical model, it's not just that we're using
    an “if” in Python. When I talk about, “Oh, I think the rainfall should be higher
    if a town is near a mountain,” that actually affects how we compute the probability
    of there being rainfall in a particular town. So it's not just that we've run
    a simulation, it actually has consequences into how you compute the log probability.
    And if it has consequences like that, then it's like, “Okay, we're not really
    evaluating this if we're interpreting it differently.”
  sec: 2378
  time: '39:38'
  who: Rob
- line: But if you're interpreting differently, you're not in Python anymore, right?
    Clearly this is living in a different space at that point. So I think it's actually
    useful to say, “Oh, this is its own language, which we can embed in Python, or
    R, and what have you. But it's definitely its own language, with its own semantics.”
  sec: 2378
  time: '39:38'

  sec: 2505

    or a unique notion of a control flow.
  sec: 2509
  time: '41:49'
  who: Rob
- line: Well, it's still a little bit abstract for me, to be honest. Maybe I should
    read those Git docs. You said that there is the University of Utah, who are really
    into programming languages. [cross-talk]
  sec: 2520
  time: '42:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. In papers there were things like “libraries of languages” and things
    like that. You import a library, and you get a new language or you have a library
    that slowly turns into a language. So there are these notions that you can… The
    distinction isn't… There is a gradient between these two. But from my perspective,
    Scikit Learn has an API – it has function calls, it has data types, and they can
    kind of be moved together. It is a language in a certain sense, but it's a very
    restricted language. Because it's so restricted, I think most people are comfortable
    calling SciKit Learn a library more than calling it a language.

  sec: 2598

    own language. When you write a model in PyMC, you get a computational graph back
    – you get an AST. What you can inspect… When you write models you aren't… You
    use Python code to write them, but what that Python code piping code is actually
    doing is building up this computational graph, which is effectively an AST.

    that. What does our program look like?
  sec: 2632
  time: '43:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: The way it would look is, you would say… Let's just pick a very simple example.
    Let's use a simple model just as an example for now. We're gonna assume that there's
    a certain annual rainfall that we expect in Germany, and we're gonna assume that
    all the cities are essentially that rainfall plus a little noise (which isn't
    the worst assumption). The way you would write that in PyMC is, “Germany rainfall
    equals normal, (the mean rainfall, the standard deviation we expect on the rainfall”.
    Now, that's not exactly how you write it because the syntax in PyMC requires that
    you put a string, so you name it… [cross-talk]
  sec: 2654

  who: Rob

  sec: 2717
  time: '45:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: At a high level, this is effectively what you do. Now, you might say, “Rainfall
    is never a negative number,” but I will handwave that and say that, “We’re going
    to use a good sampler, so we're going to try never to sample negative numbers.”
    [cross-talk]
  sec: 2720
  time: '45:20'
  who: Rob

    more time.”
  sec: 2737
  time: '45:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we can do something with that. Also, PyMC has a thing called the “half-normal,”
    which is just the normal but a part of it is just chopped off. We can do that
    as well. But we're going to do that, and then the next line is going to be, “We're
    going to sample annual rainfall for every city.” That's just going to be rainfall
    for cities equals normal, left parenthesis mean (the global mean we just estimated),
    comma some variance (we have so much variance we expect for each of the cities
    to have) comma shape equals number of cities, right parenthesis.
  sec: 2743
  time: '45:43'
  who: Rob
- line: At that point, we're then going to add another thing, which is the sewer levels
    for each city. We're gonna say the sewer levels – there's some functional relationship
    between them and we're gonna essentially call that annual rainfall thing – pass
    that through that function to get them. That's what we're going to actually observe.
    Because what we observed is how much sewer levels rose for each of the cities.
  sec: 2743
  time: '45:43'
  who: Rob
- line: So what we're doing here is some sort of linear regression, but instead of
    just output for each city, we get a distribution, right?
  sec: 2825
  time: '47:05'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 2835

  who: Rob

  sec: 2840
  time: '47:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Because we have this parameter that we're going to be using to try to keep
    all the rainfall values near this global value, because… [cross-talk]
  sec: 2844
  time: '47:24'
  who: Rob
- line: That’s why it's kind of, sort of, conceptually, like linear regression – or
    more like just regression. Because we predict – we output a number (or a bunch
    of numbers, because it's a bunch of this). Conceptually, it's a regression, except
    it's not linear regression. Right? [Rob agrees] It’s a different sort of regression
    model that outputs probabilities – not probabilities, distributions. And we have
    this ability to say that, “This is the global mean and it shouldn't be too different
    from the global mean.
  sec: 2852
  time: '47:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I wouldn't quite call it regression, because you can represent regressions
    in PyMC. You can say that you have some x, you have some y, and we have some relation
    between them (this function). This function has some weights. I don't know what
    the weights are – we're gonna put a distribution. So you can do a regression.
    This isn't quite that, but yeah, the intuition is that you can have this model
    that can say, “There is rainfall. There's a relationship between rainfall in the
    cities and the sewer tunnels. There's a relationship between rainfall between
    cities, because they're kind of near each other.” For all those, you can just
    readily encode them.
  sec: 2890
  time: '48:10'
  who: Rob
- line: This is a three-line model, but there's already quite a bit of richness there.
    Of course, that's just the model. Then you probably want stuff – you want some
    quantities to come out. You can then recall PyMC, that sample, to now get estimates
    of all the city rainfalls. You might also care about the annual one – you might
    ask for that one as well, since you've already modeled it. When this runs as samples,
    you will now have a posterior distribution on rainfalls for each city, and for
    just this estimate of what the rainfall is in the country as a whole.
  sec: 2890
  time: '48:10'
  who: Rob
- line: At that point, that's pretty good. In practice, you wouldn't just stop there.
    You might actually pull up statistics of actual previous estimates people had
    of rainfall, and if your estimate was too far from these government records, there's
    something probably wrong with your model and you would make the model slightly
    different, you might add other parameters than just measuring sewage rises. But
    over time, your estimates would start to match the kind of estimates that others
    had and you can start to have confidence that you've seemed to have captured something.

    programming languages or frameworks – what they give us is the ability to express
    our problem in some sort of language, and express dependencies between different
    things. [Rob agrees] We can say there is a… can I say locality dependence? Cities
    that are close probably shouldn't have too different… than the global… [cross-talk]

  sec: 3059
  time: '50:59'
  who: Rob

    agrees] Which kind of captures that. You can make it more complex, saying that
    cities that are close…
  sec: 3063
  time: '51:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You can start doing like spatial models, where you say, “Cities that
    are close to each other should have similar annual rainfall.” And there are ways
    to sort of encode that.
  sec: 3077
  time: '51:17'
  who: Rob
- line: Like how far it is from the sea, right?
  sec: 3089
  time: '51:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. You can encode how far you are from the sea – you can start quickly
    building up. What's nice is… What does it mean to “build it up”? You just add
    another line of code, hit “sample” again. The process is much more natural. You're
    not saying, “Oh, I want to model what it means to be ‘more far from the sea’.
    Now I have to sit, recalculate by hand. I have to check if I can still use the
    sampler from before. Am I doing something where suddenly my old sampler’s not
    good? Do I need to make a hack to get around that?” These are all things that
    used to be the norm. Now, people, by and large, write something in PyMC or other
    programming languages – things like Hakaru, Turing, Stan… There are many of these
    sorts of…
  sec: 3094
  time: '51:34'
  who: Rob
- line: And if I compare it to, let's say, (classical?) frequentist approaches – when
    we, say, have a regression problem with random forest or whatever. Then, our features
    would include all the things we talked about plus, maybe, how far the sea is,
    right? So if we want to introduce one more thing in our model (in our program),
    like the distance from the sea – in the frequentist case, we just would add another
    feature “distance from the sea”. In the case of probabilistic programming, we
    would model it differently, right?
  sec: 3148
  time: '52:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It might be [something] like you add another feature, because you're
    doing something like a Bayesian neural net, and you just add another weight –
    you put another prior on that weight – and then go from there. You just say, “This
    is just going to be ‘distance from the sea’ and how important this weight is.”.
    So you can do that as well. But if you're trying to do something where you're
    doing these groups, it actually becomes a little bit tricky to do. So if you're
    trying to do things like, say, dynamically turning on and off groups of features
    – that's a thing that's actually quite subtle to do using machine learning algorithms.
  sec: 3192
  time: '53:12'
  who: Rob
- line: In a probabilistic programming language, that's just another line of code
    – you're not even thinking about it. You're just like, “Yeah, let's group fix!
    Who cares?” You're not even thinking about, “Oh, my God! This tiny change I made
    has severely changed the algorithm and I can't use the one in SciKit Learn anymore.”
    Also, we should keep in mind that, by and large, for these prediction algorithms,
    there's no distribution. It's just, “Here are my inputs. Here are my outputs.”
    Maybe, if you’re lucky, you might get a confidence score on that output. And if
    the confidence score is too low, you might say, “Okay, maybe we should be careful
    with the prediction.” You don't get this distribution where I say, “You've given
    me this input. Here's a distribution on the values.”
  sec: 3192
  time: '53:12'
  who: Rob
- line: This becomes particularly relevant when you start getting these multimodal
    distributions, where you can say, “There isn't one good answer. There are two
    good answers that are very different from one another.” Because you might say
    things like, “Well, when there's a drought, the rainfall is very different than
    when there's not.” If you're just asking me what the rainfall is, I can say, “Well,
    in drought years, it tends to be this number – in normal years, it tends to be
    this number.” That is a thing that's very easy to express in a Bayesian modeling
    framework and very difficult to express outside of it.

  sec: 3324
  time: '55:24'
  who: Alexey

    probabilistic programming system out there. It's a pioneer in many ways, which
    I'll explain shortly. It's a leader in the space. It's the “main” one. If you
    only look at one, you should look at Stan, because it is the main and dominant
    one. Why is that? Part of what that is – there were probabilistic programming
    systems before Stan, but Stan did two things. One, it introduced HMC (Hamiltonian
    Monte Carlo) into popular use. For the moment, I'm not gonna go into what makes
    HMC special, other than to say that it's a significantly better sampling algorithm
    than all the others that were previously in use. It is so much better, that if
    your problem doesn't fit HMC, the advice is “figure out a way to make it work
    in HMC”. It's that good of a sampler – it changes the gravity around the way you
    model things.

    than if you're using other tools before Stan came along. This trend continues
    – innovations in sampling algorithms often first appear in Stan before they appear
    in other systems. This isn't fully the case, but this is the case often enough
    that it’s true. The best practices established in Stan set the tone to best practices
    used elsewhere. If an algorithm gets introduced in Stan, it'll likely appear in
    PyMC within a few months, and others. There's a strong leader role there. The
    second reason, of course, is that the algorithms that Stan users tend to have
    a lot of their own hyperparameter tuning, so they work out of the box. You're
    not doing lots of fiddling.

    samples out. You're not doing these little tweaks where you're playing with little
    parameter numbers to kind of make it work. HMC has existed for decades, but it
    requires you to know these very particular arguments that you had to pass in –
    and if you got the arguments wrong, it didn't work at all. But getting them right
    was very fiddly. Stan added features where they figured out what the correct arguments
    were to pass to HMC. So when you have things, it's called the “no U-turn sampler”
    (NUTS). The main thing NUTS is doing is taking HMC and figuring out the right
    parameters to use in HMC for your specific problem. Because of that, you essentially
    had a sampler that was very efficient and required basically little feedback to
    work. Yeah, I think Stan’s great. I'm not gonna say anything other than that.

    is because you’ve contributed to it – you're a contributor to this library. Thanks
    a lot for doing that. Do you have a couple more minutes before we finish?

- line: Great. So we have a course – it's a machine learning engineering course –
    and the way we do it is half of the content is about machine learning and the
    other half of the content is about engineering. The half that’s about machine
    learning, as you can imagine, is about the frequentist approach – linear regression,
    then we talk about logistic regression, then we also cover tree methods, and then
    cover neural networks.

  who: Alexey
- line: I imagine that some students will listen to our chat right now and some of
    them might wonder, “Okay, we now have learned these frequentist approaches, but
    I want to try something Bayesian.” What would you suggest they do? What's the
    easiest way for them with the background they already have to try something Bayesian,
    maybe with PyMC?
  sec: 3586
  time: '59:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. There's a book I like… This answer has gotten much easier in recent
    years, because people have really started to produce good materials for this.
    Before, I would have said, “Oh, you should just buy a book on Bayesian statistics.”
    I'm gonna still say that, but the books are better now. I'll suggest two things.
    There's a book on Bayesian computation that was written by a lot of the PyMC people
    – there’s Ravin, Osvaldo Martin, and a few other people that I'm blanking on.
    The book’s freely available online and you can sort of work through it and use
    PyMC to explain how to do Bayesian statistics.
  sec: 3647
  time: '1:00:47'
  who: Rob
- line: There's also an online book that's a little older, called Bayesian Statistics
    for Hackers – it also uses PyMC. But if people like a course environment, there's
    a really amazing course taught by Richard McCaffrey, who out of Leipzig, called
    Statistical Rethinking. He has an online course – previous versions of the course
    are freely available on YouTube so you can just watch the course online there.
    He has a book. The book isn't free, but the book’s very good. His book is really
    amazing. It's hard for me to… I’d be hesitant to say there’s anything  wrong with
    the book for what it does. Because what it does is – it doesn't just teach how
    to do Bayesian modeling and Bayesian  statistics, it teaches how to do statistics.
    A lot of the challenge of doing statistics is often not, “Oh, should you do frequentist
    or should you do Bayesian?” It's often, “Are you capturing causality properly?
    Are you collecting data in a good way, where you'll actually be able to learn
    something and prove your models?” It really kind of takes this big, holistic view
    ,which I think is… [cross-talk]
  sec: 3647
  time: '1:00:47'
  who: Rob
- line: It doesn’t explain why one is better than the other, it just says, “Okay.
    Here are the problems. Here are the things you need to think about. Here are the
    solutions (the tools you can use).” Right?
  sec: 3781
  time: '1:03:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: It really teaches the workflow, which is really where I think statistics really
    can be lacking. Too much of the old ways it was taught were cookbooks, effectively,
    “Here's your problem at the factory. Use this recipe from the cookbook.” Which,
    because of the dynamic way we work with data… The idea that you could do a cookbook
    for data scientists, I feel it's overly optimistic, for a lot of the challenges
    people face. Where I think this book shows its strength and it says, “Here's the
    attitude you should take for how you should be doing statistics. And if you have
    this attitude, you'll figure out the correct steps you need to do to get an analysis
    that's useful and actually informative.” So I recommend the Statistical Rethinking
    book/class, and particularly for PyMC, I recommend the Bayesian Computation book.
    [cross-talk] All the programs that were written in Stan for the Statistical Rethinking
    book have been ported to PyMC by enthusiastic volunteers.

    with the authors Martin, Kumar, and Lao. I posted the link. Then the second one,
    Statistical Rethinking, the author is Richard McCaffrey. [Rob agrees] I just posted
    the link. The examples are in R and Stan.

    things clear to me, personally. Sometimes you would say something and I would
    just think, “What is that?” But now it's clear. Thanks. Before we wrap up, is
    there anything you want to mention?

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Maybe a little bit of a plug. I do statistical consulting – that is
    kind of the main thing I do these days. I write software as well to help with
    that. For anyone who's listening to this, if you or your company have statistical
    challenges, are actually interested in maybe applying Bayesian modeling for your
    problems, reach out to me. I'm always interested in helping people out on this.
