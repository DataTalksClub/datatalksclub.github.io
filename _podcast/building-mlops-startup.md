description: 'Discover practical MLOps, model monitoring and founder-fit tactics to build an ML startup: hire, fund, productize, and reach product-market fit faster.'
intro: 'What does it take to build a successful ML startup—especially around MLOps, model monitoring, open source, and founder fit? Elena Samuylova, Co-founder & CEO of Evidently AI, joins to answer that question drawing on her applied machine learning experience since 2014, including roles at Yandex Data Factory and an industrial AI startup. <br><br> This episode walks through practical founder decisions: sourcing problem-first ideas, finding compatible co-founders and establishing pre-launch alignment, and choosing between vertical solutions and infrastructure/MLOps. Elena explains what “AI-first” positioning really means, how developer tools and open source shape go-to-market strategies (open core, cloud, monetization and cloning risks), and how Evidently validated model monitoring as a business. You’ll hear tactical guidance on customer discovery, persuading engineers to adopt your tool, data safety and on-prem deployments, hiring and scaling tradeoffs, funding paths, productizing services for non-technical founders, and normalizing failure and work–life tradeoffs. <br><br> Listen to gain actionable frameworks for building an ML startup—covering model monitoring, MLOps, open source strategy, founder-market fit, and the concrete signals that indicate product–market fit.'

- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: 'Guest Background: Elena Samuylova’s ML & Startup Journey'
- line: Today we'll talk about building machine learning startups. We have a special
    guest today, Elena. Elena is the CEO and co-founder of Evidently AI, which is
    a startup that develops open source tools for machine learning model monitoring.
    She has been in the machine learning space since 2014. Evidently is not her first
    startup. Before Evidently, Elena co-founded an industrial AI startup, so Elena
    has a lot of experience with startups.
  sec: 121
  time: '2:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's not the first time we speak with Elena, actually. Elena is a returning
    star. In February, she gave a presentation about “How your machine learning project
    will fail” which is a great talk and I recommend it to everyone. Check it out
    – it's on our YouTube channel. Before this week, it was the most popular talk
    on our channel. Now it's second because of Santiago’s talk on Monday. But this
    is a great talk nonetheless, and I do recommend checking it out. Thanks for joining
    us for the second time.
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks. I'm super glad to join.
  sec: 199
  time: '3:19'
  who: Elena
- header: 'Career Highlights: Yandex, Data Factory, and Industrial AI'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of building machine learning startups, let's
    talk a bit about your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 202
  time: '3:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: In short, it has been either about startups, machine learning, or both, pretty
    much for the last nine years. Originally, I started in the startup scene in Berlin
    when I joined a startup that was doing some ecommerce search aggregation. This
    is how I was first introduced to both topics, because they also were using some
    machine learning. It was pretty basic things back then, but still. Then I joined
    Yandex, which is the largest search engine in Russia and I was running a startup
    accelerator there. That is one of the things that I'm still super proud of, because
    it was a very rewarding experience to help other people launch their companies.
    You meet so many people who are active and doing things. It's actually very, very
    inspiring.
  sec: 213
  time: '3:33'
  who: Elena
- line: So I got inspired too and I joined an internal startup with Yandex, which
    was called Yandex Data Factory. The idea was, since Yandex did so much machine
    learning internally, we could apply it elsewhere. So we were working with different
    industries, and I was doing business development mainly.
  who: Elena
- line: Then I left to co-found the startup where we worked with manufacturing. Companies
    like steelmaking, aluminum production, oil and gas – we helped them apply machine
    learning. I was holding a product role, basically as a founder that does many
    other things, because that's what you do when you do a startup. Right now we're
    building a new startup that works with open source model monitoring. You can check
    it out and try it, it's completely free and open source, which is probably another
    topic that we will discuss – why we applied this strategy to it.
  who: Elena
- line: That said, I want to give a bit of a disclaimer – if you try to start a startup,
    you'll get a lot of advice, whether it’s solicited or not, so please take everything
    I say with a grain of salt. No one is an expert in your business, but you can
    still learn from someone else’s mistakes and thoughts. So just adjust to the experience
    when you listen to someone.
  who: Elena
- line: So including this podcast?
  sec: 309
  time: '5:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Including this podcast. Don't take it at face value.
  sec: 310
  time: '5:10'
  who: Elena
- header: 'Motivations: Startup vs. Employee Trade-offs'
- line: Do you know why people start their own business? What motivates them? Why
    not just work for a company?
  sec: 318
  time: '5:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I think it really depends – in different countries, there are different
    circumstances. It's also important to distinguish between starting a traditional
    business and building a startup. For example, you can open a restaurant or teach
    a course – something that has a known business model. Or you can go into startups,
    where you launch some tech company and try to solve something really new – it's
    a very different approach to business. When I talk about traditional business
    – for example, for immigrants, it could be like a survival strategy. You come
    to the country and start a business because it’s the only way for you to build
    up wealth. Some people want to get rich – I would actually advise against that.
    If you want to get rich, there may be other schemes than building a startup.
  sec: 328
  time: '5:28'
  who: Elena
- line: Some people want to genuinely solve a problem that they see. Some people just
    enjoy creating things from scratch – that's probably more about me, because I'm
    a type of person who likes to start up things from the very beginning. It can
    be inside a company or it can be elsewhere, but it's all about doing something
    from scratch.
  who: Elena
- line: So getting rich is not what startups are about?
  sec: 382
  time: '6:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, you can succeed, but the chances are pretty low. There are more guaranteed
    paths to do that, I would say. Working for big tech is probably much more lucrative.
  sec: 385
  time: '6:25'
  who: Elena
- line: I think I read an article somewhere where it said “If you take the expected
    value – how much on average you would earn working in a big tech company versus
    creating a startup – startups would give you smaller expected returns.”
  sec: 392
  time: '6:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: But many people enjoy the journey.
  sec: 414
  time: '6:54'
  who: Elena
- line: Yeah. I can imagine that when you make a startup, like you said in your previous
    startup and I guess in your current one, you took a product role. This meant you
    ended up doing many, many different things.
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's not just the product part, but basically everything that you need to
    get yourself to the next level, right? In different stages in the company that
    might mean different things.
  sec: 432
  time: '7:12'
  who: Elena
- header: 'Sourcing Ideas: Problem-First Approach for ML Startups'
- line: Let's say I am motivated to start a startup. I know some machine learning,
    so I want to build a machine learning startup. Where can I get ideas for that?
  sec: 443
  time: '7:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, first of all – don't. Don't start a machine learning startup. What I
    mean by that is – when you frame it like this, you actually decide on a solution
    before the problem. You already know the technology that you're going to use instead
    of looking for the best way to solve a problem. Here's a trick. You might know
    some machine learning, but ideally, if you can avoid it – don't try to build a
    machine learning startup. Try to find a problem that you can genuinely solve.
    A random example – say you want to help grocery stores get rid of ‘out of stock’
    situations. You think, “Oh, I'm going to build better forecasting models for them.”
    But then when you come and talk to them, you might learn that it's not the forecasting
    that’s the problem. Instead they maybe don't even have the data about what they
    have in the store.
  sec: 454
  time: '7:34'
  who: Elena
- line: The solution for them would be to actually build some sort of data collection
    maybe through something else. If you solve this problem, you don't even need machine
    learning. You can create value with just this. But if you come into it with the
    mindset, “No, I only want to do modeling.” You might pass this opportunity by,
    right? So it's better if you come with an open mind, if you can. That said, I
    know many people who will get stuck on a technology and it becomes a “hammer in
    search of a nail” situation. Some people succeed with this approach, but if you
    can, it would probably be best to try and avoid it.
  who: Elena
- line: So if all I want to do is machine learning, then maybe a startup is not the
    best way of doing this? There's Kaggle and other websites, right?
  sec: 522
  time: '8:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think in general, if you come to a startup, your role will change
    so much. Therefore you shouldn’t come into it with the mindset of “Hey, I want
    to do this and this is the only thing I know.” You can take this approach if you're
    an employee in a company with a predefined role and understand what exists in
    the market. With a startup, you'll be constantly doing very different things.
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Elena
- line: That said, I think there are some ways you can search for ideas, whether it
    might be related to machine learning or not. One would be actually to look at
    your own problems or even better, the problems of your company. Because when you
    are inside some business, you can observe some things like inefficiencies, come
    up with an idea, and say “Hey, let's test it. Is it big enough of a problem? Are
    people actually experiencing pain with this problem? Do they want to pay to solve
    it?” and these sorts of things.
  who: Elena
- line: Specifically for machine learning, I would definitely advise trying to team
    up with someone whose main expertise is in an area that you're interested in.
    Just as an example, this can be people who are into insurance, finance, healthcare,
    or whatever it is. I think the best way to create value in machine learning right
    now is to apply it to other vertical domains. But for that, you would typically
    need someone who can explain the fundamentals to you. You don't want to be reinventing
    the wheel and coming up with algorithms and making things that are obvious, like
    “Hey, I can do this great stuff!” But it turns out to have been done a million
    times before.
  who: Elena
- line: I would also suggest maybe to follow other startups. Because if you don't
    yet understand principles like “What is a startup?” “What is valuable on the market?”
    “What can become a company?” You first need to just develop this sense of what's
    going on by following what others are doing by following investment news, what
    type of companies have been started, and so on. This can give you an idea of what’s
    going on in the market. But don't try to search for an original idea. I think
    this is a caveat that many people fall into. It’s like a trap. “Hey, someone else
    is already doing this. No. I should come up with something that has absolutely
    never existed before.” Typically, these become things that are not really needed.
    More often than not, they just try to come up with some shiny thing that no one
    will ever use.
  who: Elena
- line: So basically, to come up with an idea, there are some ways to go about it
    that are better than others. You can try to find some problems in your own life
    and see if there is something easy that you can do to fix them. Or you team up
    with somebody who has a background in insurance or some other domain that you’re
    interested in and they can tell you about the problems they have. Then, together,
    you can think about the solution to these problems. So you would need a non-technical
    co-founder who is a domain expert in some particular area.
  sec: 640
  time: '10:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: I wouldn't say it's necessarily these are the best way, rather just some of
    the ways how you can find better problems than just by searching for it yourself.
    Ideally, if this person is as involved as they should be, they should become a
    co-founder. But you can also start a startup with people you know, and you don't
    have to be business people. Actually, I think a lot of companies are started by
    technical founders. If you're ready to learn and pick up some things and do some
    sales, probably – that is not comfortable for many technical people. This doesn’t
    mean that it will necessarily be this way. You can still learn everything you
    need to succeed.
  sec: 672
  time: '11:12'
  who: Elena
- header: 'Co-founder Search: Compatibility, Founder–Market Fit, and Finding Partners'
- line: Yeah, let's talk a bit about finding a co-founder. Let's say I am a technical
    person. I know some machine learning. I know how to code. I'm not good at sales
    – I don't enjoy selling things. I want to find somebody who might enjoy doing
    these things and maybe also be the main expert in some area. How do I go about
    doing this? Who do I need to start with and how do I find these people?
  sec: 704
  time: '11:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think there is no silver bullet for this. This question is almost like “How
    do I find my best friends?” There’s really no predefined recipe to do it. One
    thing I can say is that, ideally, you should have worked with this person before.
    In teams that have just met, it's very difficult to check how compatible you are.
    Being co-founders is a lot more than just being colleagues. When you’re colleagues,
    you can maybe be okay with most things – you don't have to agree about everything,
    especially on the values level. But when it comes to being co-founders, if you're
    successful, you have to be together for 5-10 years, working day and night. Therefore
    you should really click with this person and understand each other. It's a very
    personal thing.
  sec: 736
  time: '12:16'
  who: Elena
- line: There are people who can work together successfully and people who can’t,
    and you should really check for this kind of personal compatibility. Also consider
    your motivations. Sometimes people say, “Hey, I'm gonna join you in this startup,
    but only if you pay me this money.” Or something like “Only if it's successful
    in the first year.” But a startup is a really hard journey, so you should check
    each other’s expectations beforehand.
  who: Elena
- line: In terms of how exactly to find these people – I think it’s worth looking
    at your past colleagues and people that you've worked with – maybe as partners,
    maybe as clients, maybe you went to school with them – that is usually the better
    way. However, I've also heard how people just sometimes meet each other at hackathons
    or other events. Usually, they still work together a bit, right? Maybe not at
    a startup, but for some projects or some events. This way you can get a feeling
    of how well you communicate with person and in general, how well you get along
    with them.
  who: Elena
- line: So maybe you can do a hackathon project together and then you see how well
    you get along?
  sec: 825
  time: '13:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe. Yeah, but a hackathon is a bit of an artificial thing. I think ideally
    you should have at least one situation when you had some adversity – where something
    went wrong.
  sec: 830
  time: '13:50'
  who: Elena
- line: Like a conflict?
  sec: 844
  time: '14:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: A conflict, right. Or just a difficult situation. It will be helpful to see
    how you deal with that, not just some one-time project where no one really cares
    about what's going on.
  sec: 845
  time: '14:05'
  who: Elena
- line: I also heard about this, especially in Berlin, there are meetups like that.
    I think they're called ‘co-founder dating meetups’. What do you think about these
    events?
  sec: 853
  time: '14:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it can work. You’re still expanding your network, right? Naturally.
    This is another way to expand your network with the people who are active and
    interested. I think joining different communities is a great way to meet people.
    But it often just happens organically, from your first work or something else.
    But whether you need these meetups? It's a cool community conference, anything
    can happen.
  sec: 863
  time: '14:23'
  who: Elena
- line: But I think you said that it’s best if you work with somebody.
  sec: 884
  time: '14:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Work as in work on something – not necessarily in the same company. One thing
    I can add to this is that I think there is a thing called ‘Founder Market Fit’.
    When you understand that you are the right founders to tackle a specific problem.
    This is something that you should consider, but it’s just one example. Sometimes,
    there are companies that go after the enterprise market, which is very sales heavy.
    You go on, you try to sell a very expensive thing, and you sign a very long contract.
    Their sales is one of their core capabilities.
  sec: 894
  time: '14:54'
  who: Elena
- line: Then there are startups where you can be creating a tool for developers and
    your main capability is actually being able to understand these developers – communicating
    in their language, so to speak. There might be equally great ideas and equally
    great market opportunities, but you as a founder of a team might be better suited
    to tackle this or that idea. This is something that people sometimes don't take
    into account. But I would definitely recommend checking for this.
  who: Elena

    you want to be in this market, following these trends, talking to these people
    – for years to come. Even if the technology might look similar, you're doing machine
    learning. In my previous startup, where we were working with manufacturing – I
    was talking to heads of manufacturing companies. Now we are working with data
    scientists. It's a very, very different market in how you communicate with them.
    You should be comfortable with what area you choose.
  who: Elena

    never worked with it?

    There is a co-founder. We seem to like each other – we go along well with each
    other.

  sec: 1015
  time: '16:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I suggest that you should agree at least on a few things between you. It makes
    sense to really spell it out for each other. Sometimes people expect different
    things, but you don't understand it until you start talking to one another. So
    be honest with yourself – why are you doing what you’re doing and how long are
    you planning to be in this game? I've heard about this problem multiple times.
  sec: 1024
  time: '17:04'
  who: Elena
- line: In general, co-founder breakups are probably one of the most popular things
    for why early stage startups fail – when people really have different expectations.
    They think, “Well, I'm gonna be here for years!” and then go to work for Google.
    Another person says, “Hey, I'm going to really put everything into this startup.
    I’ll work days and nights for it.” So you should be honest in this communication.
    Why you're doing what you’re doing and how committed you are. It's better to know
    these things early on, if you have very different views on what's going on.
  who: Elena
- line: Then I think you should decide what type of company you want to build. Here,
    if you're new to this whole startup thing, a very important thing to understand
    is that startups are a very special breed of companies. If you want to raise venture
    capital, you should build a fundable venture startup – something that goes after
    a really big market. Something that can become a unicorn (1 billion dollar valuation).
    Something that can grow really fast. At the same time, it doesn't necessarily
    need to be profitable in the early days. It can bring you money later on. The
    core idea is that you want to build this company that grows really fast and has
    a chance of becoming something really, really big.
  who: Elena
- line: At the same time, you can take a different route. For example, you can just
    build a service company where you create projects, according to clients’ needs
    – whatever they want, like custom projects – you build them, you get revenue,
    you get profits, and spend them on your own things. This is not the venture way.
    You cannot raise venture capital with that. Sometimes people just don't figure
    these things out in the early days. Especially if they are not accustomed to the
    way venture capital works. Many things there are really counterintuitive. Like
    not having profits – profit is a bad thing. It means that you're not spending
    money on growth, right?
  who: Elena
- line: You should really understand and learn a little bit about this and decide
    if this is for you, because it really is a very special thing. You will have to
    go raise money, talk to investors, pitch yourself, and so on. Maybe this type
    of work is not necessarily for you. Maybe all you want is to have a relatively
    small growing business. That’s okay, too. You just need to really understand which
    one you want.
  who: Elena
- line: How do I understand that?
  sec: 1160
  time: '19:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, you should really think about this venture capital startup concept.
    Understand the benefits and the problems and then decide whether you want to try
    it or not. If you don't, you’re probably going after a more classic business approach,
    right? Then you can maybe take out a loan, you can invest in it yourself, and
    you can build it up. That's a great thing. Actually, you can be better off financially
    by doing this type of business – compared to a failed startup that tried to go
    to the Moon and didn’t.
  sec: 1166
  time: '19:26'
  who: Elena
- line: So it's about how ambitious you are? If you're very ambitious, if you want
    to conquer the world, then you go into venture capitals. If you want to just have
    one client and start developing a solution for them silently, then you just bootstrap
    yourself.
  sec: 1191
  time: '19:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, bootstrapping can still be done for venture capital startups in the
    early days. Bootstrap is more about not raising capital in the beginning and trying
    to maybe reinvest the money that you get from some clients or just trying to live
    off your savings, or do some consulting on the side. It's just the way of how
    you basically live to a point when you're going to raise money. Sometimes you
    want to do this because you want to delay it or maybe you want to just keep your
    options open. Because once you get investors’ money, you get on this train and
    you have to continue raising money and growing the business. If you’re maybe still
    undecided, you can keep both options open.
  sec: 1209
  time: '20:09'
  who: Elena
- line: So the caveat here is if investors give you money, your startup no longer
    belongs to only you. Is that right? There's investor money at stake and you basically
    need to do what they tell you sometimes, right?
  sec: 1240
  time: '20:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: In the early days, they still cannot tell you exactly what to do. It's more
    of an expectation of how it’s going to happen. In the later stages, they're probably
    going to have more than half of your company. Generally the idea is that these
    investors put money into companies that have this moonshot potential, with the
    expectation that they're going to get 10x return at least. They put money in multiple
    companies and they know that 9 out of 10 will fail. They want to find the one
    that will not. You have to continue trying to give them the belief that this shot
    is viable and continue growing as fast as you can and pouring money into growth.
    It's a very peculiar thing. It's counter-intuitive if you don't see how this actually
    happens.

- header: 'Developer Tools Market: Selling to Engineers and Open Source Dynamics'
- line: Particularly for the machine learning startups, I think you have a choice
    of whether you want to do the vertical startup approach, like I mentioned – when
    you're solving some specific need of some specific market. Or whether you want
    to build tools and infrastructure, which for technical people is often the first
    thing they think about doing, “Hey, I want to build this library.” Or “I want
    to make this tool better.” So there is this choice of going vertical or going
    after the infrastructure market, the latter of which is getting really crowded.
    We are both in this community. You see how many startups are popping up every
    day?
  sec: 1477
  time: '24:37'
  who: Elena
- line: If you think about the ML ops space, there are many companies that are trying
    to solve machine learning operations problems. Yeah, it does feel crowded sometimes.
    So this would be an example – if we take one of these companies – that would be
    an example of a tool startup? A company that develops a tool for engineers. While
    in the other case, I think you said vertical solutions?
  sec: 1329
  time: '22:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can give you a specific example. There's this company called Tractable that
    I think is based in the UK. Recently, they became a unicorn. What they do is help
    evaluate the damage for insurance purposes based on images. For example, you broke
    a car, you take a picture, and the machine learning based algorithm automatically
    judges how much the insurance payout should be. This is an example of a vertical
    startup, but it's also a somewhat boring problem – insurance and damage estimate.
    This is a vertical thing where you probably need someone who understands how insurance
    works.

  sec: 1390
  time: '23:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: It pretty much means “machine learning should be at the core of the technology”.
    But the thing is that sometimes people misuse it, just because it's a cool thing
    to say. So even if you have just a little bit of a linear regression in your startup
    – in one feature – you may say, “Hey, we're AI First.” You should really look
    what comes first.
  sec: 1396
  time: '23:16'
  who: Elena
- line: Okay, so it's a way to attract more money from investors, because investors
    want to invest into AI? Is that right?
  sec: 1417
  time: '23:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I think good investors look into their investments, but it's also a
    sort of ‘hook’ for the media. Media write more when it sounds cool – “AI First!”
    Also, it’s sometimes for the buyers, because some companies would be interested
    in buying something novel and innovative. When you say that you're AI First, you’re
    probably more novel than others. But there is also another angle to that. Many
    startups start from the machine learning part, and they eventually grow into much
    more than just machine learning algorithms or some system that was there initially.
    They start solving a growing diversity of problems, start collecting data, actually
    add the interface, and all the workflows. They become more of an analytical startup
    that does many things, AI included. So it’ll be called “AI First” but at that
    point, I don't know how ‘first’ it is. It's just a kind of marketing choice whether
    you decide to advertise yourself that way.
  sec: 1423
  time: '23:43'
  who: Elena
- line: Speaking of tools, let’s go in the other direction. I heard an expression
    from somebody that goes something like “Building tools for engineers is not always
    the best idea because engineers like building things themselves.” So they don't
    always like going and buying something – they'd rather build it themselves. So
    if you create something for engineers, how do you even overcome this? Is it something
    that you also need to think about?
  sec: 1473
  time: '24:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: You should think about this regardless of the market you choose. How are you
    going to sell to your buyers? Is there any purchasing intent there? But you can’t
    really say, “Hey, you shouldn’t do developer tools.” Look at all these companies
    that are doing just that, like Datadog or New Relic, which are doing monitoring.
    People are paying for this – GitHub and GitLab, they're doing tools for developers
    and everyone is using them. Like Jenkins. There's a whole plethora of things that
    people are still paying for, right?
  sec: 1506
  time: '25:06'
  who: Elena
- line: Yeah, actually, Datadog is a good example. This was actually part of the context
    when I heard this phrase. I was talking to a couple of people about Datadog specifically
    and one person said that engineers like open source more – they would rather have
    Prometheus, Grafana, and things like that – their own infrastructure – rather
    than just paying some external company like Datadog for collecting the metrics.
    So what they’re saying is that it's a picky market.
  sec: 1535

    – everything else can be learned. You should just be comfortable with learning
    things constantly and be comfortable with uncertainty. Be ready for a lot of rejections
    as well – be more of an optimist, you know? If you are risk-averse, you want to
    be sure of everything, and have everything guaranteed, startups are probably not
    for you. Skillswise, I think everything can be learned. There's no perfect startup
    founder that knows everything. If you're ready to learn and put some time into
    it, anyone can become a good founder.

  sec: 1619
  time: '26:59'

    things, and motivate yourself. You don't wait for someone to tell you what to
    do or explain how to do something. You do it your own way. You make a hypothesis,
    find the right people, and talk to them. So you’re doing things with an internal
    motivation as opposed to waiting for someone to explain to you what to do.
  sec: 1625

  sec: 1645
  time: '27:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I don't think that you need to always count on your intuition. But you
    can say something like, “Hey, I have this idea. Now let me check how I can verify
    it. So I'm gonna do this, I'm going to do that. I'm going to talk to these people.
    I'm going to talk to these potential customers.” But you basically need to decide
    what to do on your own. You come up with a hypothesis and how to check it.

    tech company is better than doing a startup in terms of how much money you will
    earn or the ‘expected value’. What are some other risks of building your own startup?
    You probably need to live on your own savings for some time and there is no guarantee
    that this money will come back. Are there any other risks?
  sec: 1697
  time: '28:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, actually, I don’t think you necessarily have to live on your money.
    There are other ways to go about it. Some people start alongside their day job.
    Then at some point, they become ready, roll over, and try to raise capital. Generally,
    the financial risks are huge just because you're most likely going to lose money
    with a startup. It's almost guaranteed, even if you pick the business up later
    on. So it's not the best financial decision in most cases. Generally speaking,
    you’re highly likely to fail. It's almost guaranteed statistically that you're
    going to fail as a startup, so you should prepare for this possible outcome.
  sec: 1729
  time: '28:49'
  who: Elena
- line: I think the interesting part here is also the cultural acceptance. Depending
    on where you are in the world, people can treat startup failure very differently.
    For example, if you're in the US, having a failed startup is something to celebrate.
    I may be overstating it a little bit, but it's perceived as ‘okay’ – it's a learning
    opportunity for you. In other places in the world, it can be seen as something
    that’s damaging to your future career. If you later want to try to go and continue
    your professional career after doing a startup, this is something that you should
    take into account.
  who: Elena
- line: Work-life balance can also be tough. I must say that doing startups is often
    a bit of a luxury. Not everyone can afford it in terms of their personal commitments
    and capacity to take risks. It's not always possible in many places of the world.
    You might have a family to take care of, so you cannot risk financially by doing
    a startup. So there are these things related to failure. I would not mention any
    career prospects or losing your knowledge, because I think you learn so much that
    you can later maybe find new career opportunities if you decide to go back to
    a day job.
  who: Elena
- line: That’s interesting. That's one of the things I always think about. Let's say
    I'm an engineer. I'm a data scientist and I start a startup. Most likely, I will
    end up doing other things in addition to that. Or maybe I will stop doing data
    science altogether and focus on other things. One way could be that in five years,
    I will forget how to train a logistic regression or something like that. What
    you're saying is that it's totally fine because the skills I would pick up while
    building a startup would allow me to change my career later. Is that right?
  sec: 1822
  time: '30:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I think that maybe for your technical skill set at least, you might
    become a bit rusty, unless you really invest time to support it. But you will
    also have more new career paths opening up to you. Maybe it will be more of a
    managerial role or maybe it will be a more product-focused role. Because after
    you have tried to build your own startup, you look at things not from just a viewpoint
    of how a little technical detail is implemented, but rather you look at the bigger
    picture. What you're doing, for whom, and why it is needed.

    more successful than yours was -- if you left your startup. To lead some divisions
    to grow faster. I know many founders who were struggling to hire people that have
    a startup mindset. Usually someone who tried to do one is the best candidate for
    this sort of hire.
  who: Elena
- line: You mentioned that when starting a startup, we should be prepared to fail.
    How can you prepare yourself for something like that? Is it like in Buddhism,
    you just see that the thing as already failed? Then if it actually does fail,
    you don't worry about it? How do you go about doing this?
  sec: 1910
  time: '31:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, I don't know about the specific mental techniques. But I think you should
    understand that this possibility exists and kind of normalize it for yourself.
    You shouldn’t associate yourself personally with your startup and say, “If this
    startup fails, I'm a waste. My life ends.” This is a very dangerous mindset. Instead
    you should think, “Hey, this is a thing that I'm trying. I know that it might
    not work. Even if it doesn't work, these are the things that I’m going to learn
    and this is how it’s going to help me.” Of course, you need to stay optimistic.
    Because why else are you doing this? I think just normalizing it is very important,
    so that it doesn't come off as a huge shock if it happens. Hopefully it doesn’t.

    right? Sometimes my partner even jokes, “There's weekend work!” which is the work
    you like to do. You choose to do it on your weekend, because you enjoy doing it.

    business, I know a lot of people that are. Maybe also those who are at later stages
    of a startup, when the company is a little bit more mature and they already figured
    things out. But if I look at everyone who is at the early stages, whom I personally
    know – maybe these are just the people in my circle – it's always erring on the
    side of overworking a little bit. But I think it’s by choice. You know that every
    incremental hour is gonna bring you value, right? It's not like in a big company
    when nothing will happen even if you don't touch something for a month.

    start a startup, you don't necessarily have to bootstrap yourself – meaning that
    you don’t have to live off of your savings. You can do a startup while still working.
    So this would be like a part-time startup. What do you think about this? Is it
    a good approach? Because you need to work 40 hours and then you have this part-time
    startup that eats up the rest of your week. Is it a good idea to do this?
  sec: 2046

  who: Alexey
- line: It's always very individual. It might be that your workplace is more calm  –
    things are more relaxed and sorted out. If you're in a high growth startup yourself,
    probably you cannot do this. In general, of course, it's better if you can dedicate
    yourself full time to the startup. But it's not always feasible. And especially
    if you're a technical person – you're mostly likely the one who can create the
    minimal viable product. Meaning that you provide the code yourself and then test
    the demand. So this is something that you can do or try to do. It can be something
    like a ‘weekend project’.

- header: 'Funding Models: Accelerators, Angels, and Equity Considerations'

    is the most important]. It's not a huge, complex system. It's more about figuring
    out the demand, what is needed, and then building maybe a small thing that solves
    this demand. Then you can see a huge list of people who sign up for it, “Hey!
    Looks like something. Maybe I should go and talk to investors and try to raise
    money for it.” I think actually in Germany, you have some really nice ways to
    support younger startups, especially for those coming out of university. There
    are some programs where you can apply and you will get some money as a grant –
    for free – so it's not taking equity. There are also some other opportunities
    like this, especially in Europe.

    also be an angel investor.
  sec: 2151
  time: '35:51'
  who: Elena
- line: I know a couple of people from such startup accelerators. I think the accelerator,
    the company, gives them some sort of stipend – some sort of money, a monthly allowance
    – so they do not have to starve to death while doing the startup. So they pay
    them some money while they're looking for an idea, looking for co-founders, etc..
    But then, I think they take like 30% of the company.
  sec: 2161
  time: '36:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think this is not a classical model. The classic model would be to just
    act as an early investor – to take equity or have other ways of how they take
    a portion of your company. In this case, you can spend this money however you
    like – as a startup. But you need to pass certain criteria to do so. There are
    these other/newer ways, such as Entrepreneur First. There are some other organizations
    like this that try to invite individual people and then form teams inside. But
    yes, they usually take a bit more in equity. I think all this is possible. In
    the end, when you have a successful startup, everything that has happened in the
    early days is not that important. Most startups make mistakes, do something wrong
    with their equity, and so on. It's more about whether they take 1% of a billion
    or 1% of nothing.

    great skills and your technical expertise will be beneficial. So join us. These
    are the conditions.” Then probably some people agree and that’ll be the startup.

    any resources to develop something, what do I do?
  sec: 2288
  time: '38:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: In this case, building a machine learning startup is probably going to be
    hard, but building other startups is still possible. There are currently so many
    no-code tools and you can actually hack an MVP using something like an AirTable
    and Bubble. There are Webflow and all these ways how you can create a website
    or some simple mobile app to test some idea. Then if you see that there’s demand
    for it, you can already attract the technical co-founder or even some investments.
    It doesn’t work for all types of startups, obviously. But if you want to build
    a biotech startup, for example, you also probably shouldn't go there without having
    biotech expertise. So your options are a little bit limited, but they still exist.
    There are startups, especially in SaaS, (software as a service) that being technical
    is not the most important thing. It's not some specific engine inside that makes
    it different from others, right? It's more the idea. Maybe you automate accounting
    for some companies. What you do in the first days – you are the one who is doing
    the accounting for them through the same interface that you later want to automate.
    You just need to prove that it can work and that people are ready to pay for it.

    you're referring to, or “productizing” – making your services a product. You can
    do accounting, for example. So you start doing accounting for clients. Then you
    start wrapping it up in a nice interface. You then let your customers or clients
    actually use this interface. Maybe at the beginning, you do the accounting yourself
    under the hood, but then you can automate it. Is that the approach?

- line: If it can be fully automated, yeah, that's an awesome startup. The challenge
    is that sometimes you can’t. So you have a very custom thing and then it's very
    difficult to scale. Because you still need someone who understands accounting
    to deal with each individual client's issues. Unless you're really standardized,
    it’s hard to make it work.

  who: Alexey
- line: It depends. I don't know the details about the exact case, but I would suggest
    that if you already have someone who is ready to work with you, just try and learn
    from this first customer. You should always favor action when you're doing a startup,
    because you're going to learn from it. And you will learn something new when talking
    to the client and possibly discover “What exactly is needed?” Very often, in a
    startup, you change your idea or it evolves – it's almost normal that it evolves.
    If you look at many successful startups, they often started as something else.
    I would not overthink it, though. I would not overplan stuff. I would always just
    try to go and talk to these potential users and learn something from them. If
    you cannot get to these users easily, probably that's not your startup, because
    you will need to continue generating ways of how to reach them.

    code without talking to your users. That sounds awesome, right? Doing a very shiny

    those might be my potential buyers – accountants (for example). So I'm going to
    talk to five accountants and ask them questions about their problems.” And if
    you still keep hearing new things – each of them is saying different things –
    you probably should continue talking to people. If you talk to maybe ten and you

    a reasonable enough number.

    get created for different companies, and most recently in the manufacturing world,
    we saw that there are a lot of problems that are not related to the core technology,
    but rather to its adoption. Also the problems with what happens after we put models
    in production. I know if you are hanging out in this community, that may sound
    trivial – that many people are already solving these types of problems. But in
    the beginning of last year, it was not that obvious for many people. If you talk
    to more traditional companies, you will also learn that they actually have these
    same problems – how your monitor your models work, how you understand what's going
    on with them, are they working or not, and other caveats.
  sec: 2652
  time: '44:12'
  who: Elena
- line: Based on our past experience we thought that it's an interesting idea. We
    actually had several different ideas. We went to talk to people in order to validate
    them and monitoring was the one that we saw a lot of response for. People were
    quoting us, “The model’s broken and people don't notice!” “It's annoying and no
    one wants to do this!” “The data scientists leave the project and monitoring doesn't
    happen - the models are left uncontrolled.” So we heard this and said, “Hey, we
    validated this idea out of something we have. Let’s work on this.” So we went
    on to build Evidently and we’re super happy with how we're doing. We have a great
    team. This is an important part of working together – having a relationship.

  sec: 2735
  time: '45:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, you know, talking to people is something that’s always happening. You
    talk to a few people, you process the feedback. In the process of talking to them,
    we already made some mock-ups, for example. We tried to show “Hey, is this what
    you expect? Would you like to look at this or that?” It kind of happens throughout
    the process. When we began working with Evidently, it was the beginning of the
    lockdown. The world felt a bit crazy. At the same time, it was very easy to talk
    to everyone on Zoom, because everyone was just sitting at home. We were just talking
    to a lot to people and then switching over to coding and things like that. In
    our case, we are complementary in our skillset. For example, I was focusing on
    initiating contact with these people – calling them up, inviting people to chat
    – and Emeli was doing the prototyping at first, and then the actual coding when
    we proceeded to development.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I’m non-technical. Well, I'm our designer for blogs, too. So the role
    really evolves over time in your company. When we were just starting out, it was
    talking to users and trying to process the feedback, organizing it, coming up
    with ideas. Then we started working on it, and now do a lot of content-related
    work. I'm writing all these blogs that help us talk to users and generate interest
    in what we're doing. I’m talking to investors and potential investors, and building
    up all the parts beyond the code, pretty much. How you set up the company, where
    you incorporate, how you organize it all – CEO is not just a title. It isn't a
    certain role that you do, right? It's  “chief everything officer” which is not
    code in our specific example. But I will say it really depends on what startup
    you are doing. It can all be different for you. If the startup was focused on
    direct enterprise sales, for example, I would be doing the sales. This is what
    I did in my past startup. Now we are dealing more with evangelizing and talking
    to users about open source. Because it's free to use, we are more interested in
    people trying it out and giving us feedback on it. That's what I'm trying to do
    in my most recent days.

  sec: 2891
  time: '48:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: It can actually be very successful to go to market with this strategy for
    many infrastructure startups nowadays. It can also just be a rational choice if
    you do infrastructure. You can see companies like Grafana – they actually monetize
    their open source business, but they create a lot more value by creating this
    open source tool as well. For us, it also resonated a lot because it seems like
    a very natural and good thing to do, because it creates a lot of value for the
    users. So what you do is basically monetize only some parts of them, which would
    be for the large enterprises that are ready to pay for what you do.
  sec: 2899
  time: '48:19'
  who: Elena
- header: 'Open Source Risks: Cloning, Cloud Providers, and Licensing'
- line: Another aspect of that is that you actually get very fast iterations and feedback
    loops because of it. For example, if you just create a huge, monolithic, closed
    source thing, you first need to create it and deploy it on some customer and then
    see if they like it or not. With open source, you can release small features.
    It can even be not yet fully functional, but people are already trying it and
    they say something to you about it. This helps you to iterate a lot faster. So
    I think it's a very nice way to build up your product, when it’s public like this.
    It’s also a good market strategy for later on, because open source doesn't mean
    that you don't make money out of it. It's just a different strategy.
  who: Elena
- line: There is a concern I often hear from some people. They say, “Why would I open
    source my code? People will just go and copy my code and deploy it. So this strategy
    doesn't work.” This is the concern they have. Is it a valid concern?
  sec: 2969
  time: '49:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, if we cannot create anything else beyond this code and we don't plan
    to, then probably. But if you will continue building the product and innovating
    and building the team, you will be the one who owns all the knowledge as well
    as the future vision of the roadmap. Then you can create and maintain the open
    core products. That's how it's often done. You have the open source part and you
    have some functionality that is part of a paid enterprise offering. You, as a
    creator of the project, know how it actually, truly works, right? So you can be
    successful in maintaining it. You also own the community. Companies who want to
    pay for the product usually want to pay the original developer not someone else
    who just copied it.
  sec: 2990
  time: '49:50'
  who: Elena
- line: That said, there is one thing related to cloud providers that has recently
    been a big thing in the open source world. Another way you can monetize machine
    learning that's open source is by creating a cloud version of your product – literally
    the same product, but you do all the hosting and scaling and provisioning. So
    basically, all the DevOps parts behind it. And people literally pay just for you
    to run this project and product for them. For example, if someone like Amazon
    comes and takes the same product, and hosts it...
  who: Elena
- line: Like ElasticSearch, right?
  sec: 3057
  time: '50:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. So they have to introduce a license that explicitly forbids just
    this part. But still, now it's more of a collaborative relationship with the big
    cloud providers, because they also don't want to be seen as the bad guys killing
    someone else's open source. If you do the open core approach, you're not hindered
    by this.
  sec: 3058

  sec: 3078

    everything they do. Sometimes they’re even like, “No, I'm not going to tell you
    my idea.” It doesn't really work like this. It's still a lot of work behind just
    what's out there to make it turn into a company. There are so many great examples
    like Mongo, Elastic, Grafana, GitLab – they're all open source, right? And they're
    all huge.

    So you don't need to go through the management, and kind of force the engineers
    to use your solution. Because the engineers are already using it, right?
  sec: 3108
  time: '51:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Ideally, yes. This concept even has a name – it’s called “bottom-up adoption”.
    You come in from the bottom and go up in the company. The truth is, big enterprises
    want to pay for a good product, because if you're running something in production,
    you rely on it. So you want to make sure that someone is responsible for how well
    it performs. If you're an enterprise, you’re ready to pay for security, for safety,
    for the peace of mind that this thing performs really well.

    a CTO just signs a big deal with someone like Oracle, and they bring it to the
    developers and say “Here, you better use this thing.” And the developers don’t
    like it. They don't want to learn the thing that is maybe not transferable in
    terms of skills to their next place of work. Whereas open source is something
    that's going to continue to be out there. So you are essentially increasing your
    own personal value when you work with open source. It's a very efficient model.
    Now that enterprises are used to running open source products in production, this
    business model has become possible.

    so many barriers when you're selling something, right? It's just the initial part
    of offering something. You must provide enough value for people to do something
    or to work with you. This ‘doing something’ might even be just installing the
    product or running it – it's still work that is needed from their side – or to
    adopt it into their workflow, or learning how to use it. You should just present
    the value as so high that people will overcome this barrier. In the end, it's
    all about finding this value.  This is kind of what makes a startup a startup.

  sec: 3237
  time: '53:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, absolutely. It's really, really different, especially if you build a
    startup for local markets. When it comes to venture funded startups, it's all
    about your exit opportunity. Are you going to do an IPO and be traded on NASDAQ?
    Or are you going to be sold to a large company that's going to pay hundreds of
    millions of dollars for your startup? These opportunities are different in different
    markets. The reality of the startup scene is a very different one. The attitudes
    of investors also vary. For example, in Europe people tend to be a bit more risk
    averse – the valuations for startups are a little bit lower. In the US, it’s a
    little bit different, especially in California, where there are so many startups
    popping up and there's a lot of money available to them. The way you build them
    and how much money you can get really depends specifically on the market that
    you’re addressing. You can be based in Germany, but you can sell worldwide. But
    if you're doing some accounting software that’s specifically focused on the German
    market, you might eventually have 100% of this market, but it's going to be very
    different. This probably deserves a whole separate discussion, but yeah, there
    is a difference depending on where you're based. If you're raising capital from
    investors, it matters how it looks in terms of startup scene and the capital available.
  sec: 3246

    are more hesitant to share their data. While maybe in Russia, people say, “Okay,

  sec: 3317

    are more used to using cloud providers in general, so the data on your sales will
    be in Salesforce, right? In many other places, people still want to keep everything
    on-premises. But I must say that almost any startup that works with B2B, it will
    come to data sharing. Even if it's just sales software where you put your sales
    numbers – you're still putting in your sales numbers, it's a big deal to overcome
    this aversion. But you can see that many startups made it, so it's possible when
    you provide enough value. Open source is actually another workaround to get around
    this. To use an open source tool in the early days, you don't have to send data.
    It makes it so much easier to try the tool, as compared to sending the data somewhere
    in the cloud.

    it in a nice way. If you send it to the cloud, you can host it in the right location.
    All the cloud providers allow this. It still requires you to pass through some
    safety checks in many, many cases. It's doable, although it may be hard. If you're
    selling something, you will have to object against many things like this. Just

    you shouldn’t overhire and build a huge team before you have the so-called ‘product

    I think it's best if it's only the founders or a very, very small team working
    with them, because one day you can just up and say “Hey, we're gonna throw away
    everything we did. Now let's redo it. Let's change the course completely.” So
    it's better done in a very small team and you don't want to spend a lot of money

    There's a demand for it. Now we are moving more to the scaling phase, or to building
    up more features that the users want, or to being able to serve more users.” That’s
    when you should hire. But you should be guided by the actual business needs, not
    because, “Hey, I have a feature list of 100 ideas. I need to hire as many engineers
    as I can to build all this”. You should be more focused on “Is there anyone who
    really needs what I’m building?”

- line: You mentioned at the beginning that you need to “follow startups”. You need
    to know what others are doing, see what kind of investments they're getting, are
    they pivoting, what kind of clients do they have? Is there a specific way for
    people to follow other startups?

- line: I think you can join so many communities to accomplish this. Once you become
    part of it, this information just starts pouring. You follow some people on Twitter,
    you’re in some Slacks, you read TechCrunch. I wouldn't suggest just going crazy
    and trying to keep up with everything that's happening – you just won’t be able
    to. But it's just helpful, especially if you were not exposed to this before,
    to look at some investment news, and maybe try to decode, “Hey, what are they
    doing? Why were they attractive to investors?” Just learn and kind of reverse
    engineer their success a little bit.

- line: Also keep in mind that what's written on TechCrunch might not necessarily
    be 100% reality – it's a bit of a vision of what the startup is doing. It's really
    helpful to get this general understanding just by looking at others. Maybe you
    can keep up with the news related to your domain so that you know who the big
    competitors are. You'll definitely be asked about it.

- header: 'Final Advice: Build from Genuine Interest, Not Just Hype'
- line: Well, I think that if you want to build a startup, it's a very good thing
    to try to do. Ideally, in a nicer way – so you don't have to risk all your money
    or something like that. These days, there’s a good opportunity to do that. There
    is a lot of capital available, there are programs that support you. But I also
    suggest being honest about your intentions. Don't just follow the hype and think
    “Hey, I'm going to be giving talks everywhere because I'm a startup founder!”
    and enjoy this social part of it. Because it's actually a very hard thing to do.
    You shouldn’t go for it just for fun or just for money. You should be genuinely
    interested in what’s you’re doing.
