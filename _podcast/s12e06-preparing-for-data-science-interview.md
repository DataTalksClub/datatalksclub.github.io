short: Preparing for a Data Science Interview
title: "Master ML & Data Science Technical Interviews: Recruiter-Proven Stages, Prep & Resources"
transcript:
- header: 'Guest Introduction: Luke Whipps & Neural AI'
- line: This week, we'll talk about preparing for a technical data science interview.
    We have a special guest today, Luke. Luke is a co-founder of Neural AI, a company
    that specializes in recruiting data scientists and other AI professionals. He
    has over 10 years of experience working with recruiters and what’s more, Luke
    is also a podcast post. He's hosting the AI Game Changer podcast. Pleasure to
    have you.
  sec: 101
  time: '1:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Pleasure to be here, for the second time! I feel like we just do podcast episodes
    with each other now. We really need to get other guests. [laughs]
  sec: 140
  time: '2:20'
  who: Luke
- line: Exactly. Yeah, I was going to mention that. Luke is actually on the podcast
    for the second time. Luke is one of our very first guests. I think you were like
    third or fourth. I don't remember. The last time I interviewed you, it was two
    years ago, when the DataTalks.Club podcaster just started. It's been a while.
    Before we actually start, I want to mention that the questions for today's interview
    were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, for the help. Let's start. Luke,
    tell us what's up.
  sec: 149
  time: '2:29'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Recruitment Career Overview: ML focus, startups, Germany'
- line: What have you been up to since we spoke last time? Maybe also tell us in your
    words about yourself before that.
  sec: 183
  time: '3:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Maybe I can give you and the listeners a bit of background about me.
    As you’ve quite rightly mentioned, I've been in recruitment for well over a decade
    now. I've got the gray hairs and the crows’ feet to prove it. But historically,
    I used to help companies find data professionals, but more from kind of a traditional
    BI/descriptive analytics-y focus.
  sec: 192
  time: '3:12'
  who: Luke
- line: Over the past 10 years, that's kind of transitioned and I've worked with the
    market. Over the past, maybe six years now, I would say that I've had three key
    focuses. Number one – machine learning or deep learning at the core of all of
    the engineering hires that I've made. And obviously, that would encapsulate all
    of the other bits around that traditional data science or data engineering and
    everything else in between.
  sec: 192
  time: '3:12'
  who: Luke
- line: I've worked pretty much exclusively with early- to mid-stage startups. I don't
    do much in the corporate space anymore. As I said, I tend to work with smaller
    organizations that really need me. And then lastly, I do most of my work in Germany.
    I'd say that 90% of my work is in Germany. Since the pandemic, I've broadened
    out to Central Europe as a whole, but I've still got my core client base in Germany.
    So yeah, that's me.
  sec: 192
  time: '3:12'
  who: Luke
- header: 'Remote Work & Client Geography: UK base serving German market'
- line: But you're not based in Germany, right?
  sec: 280
  time: '4:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. I’m in Kent, if anyone knows where that is – it's a really beautiful part
    of the UK. I don't know if you can see, actually, in the background – I've just
    had the office renovated and stuff. Really happy about that.
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Luke
- line: I'm just curious, how does it happen that recruiters from the UK work in Germany?
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is a bit of a long story. [laughs] I will try and condense it.
  sec: 305
  time: '5:05'
  who: Luke
- line: You’re not the only recruiter from the UK who works in German. It's quite
    a trend. I don't actually know many German recruiters.
  sec: 309
  time: '5:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The story is – I'll try and condense this as much as I can. I can't
    remember when it was. I don't know what year it was. But long story short, I was
    moving to Australia and in the time, I joined the company in Australia, and in
    the time period of me waiting for my visa to come, they went “Look, why don’t
    you join us and work with our German business and help us do some business development
    and win some clients and do some recruitment in Germany in the interim of you
    moving over to Australia?”
  sec: 316
  time: '5:16'
  who: Luke
- line: In that interim period, I met Rachel, who is my co-founder, girlfriend, and
    life partner. As I said, it got to a stage where I was like, “I'm moving to Australia
    and blah, blah, blah.” Long story short, it kind of worked out that I actually
    just stayed in the UK, and I really enjoyed working with German clients and German
    people in general. So it just continued from there. That was a very condensed
    version. Serendipitous, I guess. But yeah, it was cool, man.
  sec: 316
  time: '5:16'
  who: Luke
- line: Okay. Do you remember what we spoke about two years ago?
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Standing out as a data scientist was the topic, right? [Alexey agrees] But
    yeah, the specifics, man… you're gonna have to remind me. [chuckles]
  sec: 382
  time: '6:22'
  who: Luke
- line: I don't remember myself. [chuckles] But yeah – what were you up to these few
    years? What changed? Apart from the new office.
  sec: 390
  time: '6:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: To be honest, not much has changed since we last spoke in terms of what I
    do on a day-to-day basis. I think now, as an individual and a business, I feel
    a lot more embedded into the community. Obviously, I've been running the podcast,
    already releasing a lot of content on a weekly basis, and I feel like I'm much
    more well-known in the industry now than what I was three, four, or five years
    ago. I think that's largely due to now that I've worked myself… [cross-talk]
  sec: 401
  time: '6:41'
  who: Luke
- line: The podcast, right?
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, yeah. [reluctantly] That's kind of a big part of it, as well. But I
    think largely, when I used to work for other organizations that were a lot more
    corporate and bigger, I had to be a recruiter for that business, but now I feel
    like I can be exactly who I am and all of my content and what I do and how I've
    worked with customers and people, it reflects that. I feel like I'm just much
    more well-known in the industry now than what I was when we first spoke.
  sec: 430
  time: '7:10'
  who: Luke
- line: As I said, I think that's largely due to just being able to be myself and
    do what I do without having ultra amounts of pressure from directors and the organization
    to make placements at all costs. But on a day-to-day basis, I do recruitment and
    I work with my customers and we make placements and it's really good fun. As I
    said, it's been fun. Did we talk at the beginning of the pandemic? I can't remember
    when we actually recorded that podcast, but that was probably the worst year of
    my recruitment career.
  sec: 430
  time: '7:10'
  who: Luke
- line: Two years ago. Now it's 2023. So it was January 2021.
  sec: 498
  time: '8:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. We’d probably just come out of the worst year of my recruitment career.
    And we were probably just stepping into the best year of my recruitment career.
    Yeah, it's been fun, man. It's been good.
  sec: 504
  time: '8:24'
  who: Luke
- header: 'Podcast Purpose: AI Game Changers format and goals'
- line: I’m glad to hear that. So tell us about your podcast.
  sec: 515
  time: '8:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So the podcast was spun off in the midst of the pandemic. My job became
    pretty redundant. I didn't know many companies that were hiring, and the ones
    that were hiring definitely were not using external headhunters to find talent.
    For probably about nine months, I was just like, “Shit, I just don't know what
    I'm gonna do now, because most companies don't want to use me. It's all known
    for. What am I going to do?” The podcast spun out of “Look, in that time period,
    I need to do something for the community. Right now I can't offer them jobs. I
    can't help them get new jobs. So what else can I do?”
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Luke
- line: I've always toyed with the idea of running a podcast. But to be honest, it
    was always kind of a side note for me like “If I get time to do it, then it'll
    be something that I will do.” It kind of always got pushed to the side. I think
    2020 was the best chance to launch something like that and I'm really glad I did.
    It's really cool. Again, I've just talked to AI, data science, and machine learning
    leaders in Germany, in Central Europe, about their journey within the space that
    we were working in. Typically, I'll talk to early stage founders and we'll talk
    about their journey from the first initial concept up to where they are today
    in their journey to get there. Yeah, it's going on, man.
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Luke
- line: To be honest, after the pandemic, work completely exploded. I had to take
    a bit of a backseat on the podcast for a bit, which was probably not my best decision
    because we got it up to a really good stage and then I dipped off because I was
    just so busy with work. Now we're gradually getting it back up there now. We run
    everything on video now. It's a slightly different angle than what we had before.
    But if anyone's keen, the difference between what you do and what I do is that
    yours is very practical – people can actually learn from the DataTalks podcast
    in one way, shape, or form.
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Luke
- line: My podcast is a little bit more about stories. I really want to explain the
    journey of organizations and give people an opportunity to share their story,
    what the business does and ultimately, just illuminate the companies that are
    working in the AI community in Germany. If you're interested in stories, maybe
    not necessarily learning, but interesting conversations, then it's probably cool
    to check it out. But if you want to learn stuff, stick with Alexey. [laughs]
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Luke
- line: One does not exclude another, right? [Luke agrees] I’m wondering if we look
    at the number of podcasts created over each year, there must be a spike in 2020.
    This is when DataTalks.Club podcasts also started. Probably everyone was like,
    “Okay, pandemic. What do we do? Let's start a podcast.”
  sec: 688
  time: '11:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Probably boredom had a part to play in that, right? It's just something
    to do. But… [laughs]
  sec: 708
  time: '11:48'
  who: Luke
- header: 'Recruiter Strategy: Embedded talent specialist and candidate coaching'
- line: I don't know if it's just boredom, but maybe a need to be connected? [Luke
    agrees]. Well, you said during the pandemic times, you wanted to do something
    for the community, but you couldn't help them get jobs. So you decided to do a
    podcast. But now, you can actually help them get jobs, right? How do you do this?
  sec: 714
  time: '11:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Clients typically work with me on positions that they find really difficult
    to fill. These are traditional data science positions that don't get a lot of
    work in that kind of space anymore. Usually, what happens with most markets is
    – as new things come into the machine learning data science world, there are fewer
    and fewer people at the beginning of that bell curve of that particular thing.
    So usually, clients work with me at the beginning of new things that happen in
    the market. To give you an example, ML Ops is a really hot topic for me right
    now. Most companies that I'm working with, I'm looking for someone or some people
    to help with infrastructure and the operational side of ML. But if you ask me
    the typical roles that I recruited for like five, six years ago, I'd say data
    scientists and big data engineers.
  sec: 739
  time: '12:19'
  who: Luke
- line: My role kind of transitioned with the market. But yeah, customers work with
    me to find niche hard-to-find people. My role, essentially, is to be an intermediary
    between the customer and the individuals that I'm representing. In a slightly
    different way than what most of the recruitment industry works like, I only work
    with two to three customers in one go. I'm only one person, so I can't work with
    100 customers at once, otherwise, I just wouldn't be able to service them. I work
    with two to three customers at once and I work really, really closely with them.
    The way that I typically try and frame it with those customers is that “I am your
    embedded AI talent specialist for the time that we're working on a particular
    project together,” but externally, with the candidates that I represent, I try
    to be as involved in the job search with individuals that I've worked with as
    possible. What I don't want to do is just be like a job filter for people – to
    just send them job specs and just coordinate interviews. That's really not what
    I want to do.
  sec: 739
  time: '12:19'
  who: Luke
- line: This is gonna sound a bit cheesy, but what I really want to become known for
    is that I'm a seminar career coach. That does sound super cheesy, but ultimately,
    I think if you've ever worked with me before, you'll know that I pretty much help
    you with every single stage of the process – be that the intro stage, be that
    technical, how to speak to VPs and senior management, often negotiation and closing.
    I’ll pretty much hold your hand through the entire interview process from the
    very, very get-go and I’ll pretty much walk people through the stages within all
    of the companies that I've worked with. If you've ever worked with me before,
    I hope you would agree with that. [chuckles] So, as I said, I work pretty much
    in the middle between customers and candidates, but what I try to do is work really,
    really closely with the people that I work with.
  sec: 739
  time: '12:19'
  who: Luke
- line: I cannot say publicly if I worked with you, right? [chuckles]
  sec: 923
  time: '15:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. [laughs]
  sec: 931
  time: '15:31'
  who: Luke
- header: 'Market Snapshot: hiring trends, layoffs, and candidate concerns'
- line: Okay. [laughs] We should probably go through each of these – as you said,
    there's the intro stage, technical stage, talking to management, negotiation.
    I definitely want to cover all that. But before that, I have a very interesting
    question. Right now, the market for all the tech jobs seems like it’s going down,
    right?
  sec: 932
  time: '15:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: What I want to say is, I see companies doing layoffs, getting a job is harder
    – the market is shifting from being the candidates’ market to the companies' market.
    It's harder and harder to find a position. For you, as a recruiter, what's changed
    in the last six months?
  sec: 932
  time: '15:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can only talk from my own personal experience, but being really honest,
    I've not noticed any difference. In big tech, of course, everything's on fire
    at the moment. There are tons of layoffs happening, and no doubt people are really
    affected by that. But the work that I do right now? Honestly, it's not any different.
    This week, I’ve brought on… Well, I mean, there are potentially another two to
    three customers that want to work with me right now. So I'm still at capacity
    all the time.
  sec: 980
  time: '16:20'
  who: Luke
- line: That said, I don't work with everyone, so I might have a very small window
    into what the market actually looks like. But for me, though, the customers that
    I'm working with are still hiring. They've got the funding to do so. Maybe I'm
    just lucky in the fact that the customers that I do work with are in really good
    positions. No doubt, there are different stories across the whole market. But
    for me, personally, it's pretty good. Touch wood, I hope that continues. [chuckles]
  sec: 980
  time: '16:20'
  who: Luke
- line: As I said, right now I feel like I'm in a pretty good position. I feel like
    the clients I'm working with are in pretty good positions. It's really difficult
    to say because I don't know the entire market, but this small subsection of the
    clients that I've worked with and who I know are in the market… it seems fairly
    similar, bar a couple of little events that have happened. But generally, I can
    see the market kind of bouncing back from it the next couple of… I've seen this
    happen throughout my career, pretty much every single company that I've worked
    with – you get huge layoffs, there's tons of shit on LinkedIn about the markets
    and fire and “there's going to be a huge recession period” and stuff. And then
    in six months time, everything is back to normal.
  sec: 980
  time: '16:20'
  who: Luke
- line: I'm not worried about what's happening out there, I guess. But maybe that's
    super naive and really ignorant. From where I'm sitting right now, man, the market’s
    still on fire, especially if you're good at what you do. There's always going
    to be opportunities. If it's not there, it's going to be somewhere else. Right?
    So yeah, from where I'm sitting, it seems pretty good. People are probably shaking
    their head at me right now thinking, “Well, you don't know what I know.” But I
    don't. So, yeah.
  sec: 980
  time: '16:20'
  who: Luke
- line: It's good to be an optimist. Right? That too. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1129
  time: '18:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. A blind sort of optimist. [laughs]
  sec: 1134
  time: '18:54'
  who: Luke
- line: From what you said – the budgets are still the same. They are not reducing
    budgets, so candidates can still get the same salaries as they were getting previously.
    You still have clients, the clients have money, and they are in a good position,
    so for now, you don't see any reason to worry.
  sec: 1137
  time: '18:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't think we've seen the full flow-down effect of what's happened in the
    market. It's too early to say right now, right? It could be a very, very different
    market in the next six months. What I know right now is that not much has changed
    from my side. I'm not really seeing any trickle-down effects just yet. What that
    looks like in 6-12 months, I'm not sure.
  sec: 1158
  time: '19:18'
  who: Luke
- line: Maybe it became easier to close positions because there are more candidates
    on the market? Or for the positions you work with, it's as hard as it used to
    be? Nothing’s changed?
  sec: 1184
  time: '19:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [laughs]
  sec: 1198
  time: '19:58'
  who: Luke
- line: Still hard, right?
  sec: 1199
  time: '19:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I don't think I would have a job if it ever became easy. If there were
    a huge influx of candidates on the market that made me redundant, people would
    get them directly. They would just hire them directly. But I think the true value
    in working with a headhunter is not necessarily the presentation of candidates.
    It's much more about the process – ownership from end to end, both from a client
    and from a candidate perspective. There might be more people on the market right
    now. But then, there's still the same amount of competition going after that talent,
    so that doesn't change. It's a bit messy right now. I don't know exactly how that's
    going to transition over the next 6-12 months. But for me, I've not really seen
    anything where I’m like, “Oh, shit. This is a big change.”
  sec: 1200
  time: '20:00'
  who: Luke
- line: To give you an example, when COVID hit, that was the biggest shock of my entire
    career, where I was like, “This is awful. We can potentially go out of business
    and I could run out of money.” Right now, with looking at the current pipeline
    that we have, just what's generally the energy in the market – if anything, I'll
    probably hear a little bit more from a candidate’s perspective that they're a
    little bit more apprehensive about going to startups and companies that don't
    necessarily have a route to profitability. There are a lot more questions that
    are focused on funding and stability and stuff like that, that I didn't really
    get in 2021. Well I did, but not as much as now. It's probably a little bit more
    common to think about risk on the side of the candidates right now. But generally,
    as I said –I compare everything to COVID now. I'm just like, “Is it as bad as
    March 2020? No.” So it's not too bad. [chuckles]
  sec: 1200
  time: '20:00'
  who: Luke
- header: 'Interview Process Overview: stages, scope, and assumptions'
- line: 'Okay. Well, the topic today is technical interviews, right? You said that
    you, as a recruiter, are quite involved in the interview process. What you do
    is help the candidates at every stage, which you mentioned are: introduction stage,
    technical interview, then speaking with top management (VP, directors) and then
    finally, the negotiation stage. Can you walk us through the stages? What happens
    at each of these stages and how do you help candidates there?'
  sec: 1322
  time: '22:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That's quite a lot. I just want to work out where we need to start with
    that so people don't get overwhelmed with information if we did the whole thing.
    If we break that down, I guess, and just do one stage at a time. Personally, I
    think that there are different expectations for, obviously, all of those stages.
    I think the prep needs to be associated with what we're trying to achieve in the
    individual stages. I think if we just make some assumptions, because I'm going
    to talk really broadly. There are going to be some companies out there where this
    is not going to make sense for. And there are going to be some situations where
    they're a bit abstract and a bit left wing.
  sec: 1362
  time: '22:42'
  who: Luke
- line: I think the challenge with interviews is that, if you've interviewed at 100
    different companies, you'll probably get 100 different experiences, or at least
    50. So take everything that I'm saying now with a pinch of salt. I think I put
    a post out not too long ago – if anyone wants this document, I'll happily send
    that to them. And if anyone wants to talk to me about it directly and ask me specific
    questions about specific interview processes, I'm more than happy to help. But
    anyway, that's just a bit of a caveat. I think the assumptions that I've made
    are – this is pretty much focused on junior to senior-ish level hires. Anything
    principal (lead management, any of those highs) there's a different level of prep
    and different levels of expectations. I'll push that to one side.
  sec: 1362
  time: '22:42'
  who: Luke
- line: 'Number two is that, the interviews that you''re going to, you''re actually
    capable of doing that role and it''s a logical step. If you''re a junior engineer
    and you''re prepping for a CTO role – you can prep until your eyes for it out,
    but that''s probably not going to happen, right? So number two – the roles that
    you''re interviewing for, you''re capable of doing them. It''s a role that you
    want, not just “an interview”. The process is fairly standard – three stages:
    intro, technical, final stage (senior management, VP-ish) kind of interview. That''s
    typically what I see. Maybe there are two stages in the technical part, but generally,
    that''s the process.'
  sec: 1362
  time: '22:42'
  who: Luke
- line: The last assumption that I make is that you're working with someone who's
    semi-decent at giving you some information. So you're working with either a good
    recruiter, a good internal person (a good HR person internally) or the manager
    that you're working with, from a technical side of things, is a good person or
    the founder or whatever. But you've got a contact that's associated with that
    business that you can strip information from in some sort of way. It's not always
    the case, but 9 times out of 10, there'll be someone in that chain that you'd
    be able to speak to. Does that make sense? I'll feel like I rambled my way through
    that.

    cool. The intro meeting is obviously going to be the first stage with all candidates.

  who: Luke

  sec: 1562
  time: '26:02'
  who: Luke
- line: So that's like “stage zero,” sort of – the initial chat with you. When you
    reach out to a candidate, you say, “Hey, I'm working with this client. They have
    this awesome role. How about we connect?” [Luke agrees] You reach out, then you
    have a conversation, so that's stage zero.
  sec: 1565
  time: '26:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: You understand that, “Okay, the candidate wants to try this position.” What
    do you do? You show the CV of the candidate to the company? They say “Okay, let's
    interview that person.” And then you arranged an interview. Then this is where
    the introduction stage happens, right?
  sec: 1565
  time: '26:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, correct. The companies that I work with now, I've worked with them for
    quite some time. Usually, I'll just put people into the diaries, because I've
    got such a good understanding of what they're looking for. I'll send the CV, just
    to be polite like, “Hey, man, I'm booking this guy with you. If you have any questions,
    let me know.” But I'm kind of at a stage now where the customers that I've worked
    with, I just know them inside out. There's not really much guesswork in terms
    of the work that I do now. But anyway – exactly.
  sec: 1603
  time: '26:43'
  who: Luke
- line: The way that you should look at me is that I'm a filter between the end client
    and the candidate. I'm not an interview stage. For me, I really want to understand
    what makes you tick as a candidate, because you might say some things to me that
    I think “You know what, then that's not going to work with this customer, or that's
    not going to work. That's not the right role for you. There's going to be better
    opportunities out there that will give you that kind of thing that you're looking
    for.” And then vice versa, if there's parts about the cultural fit or if there's
    parts about the technical skills that I know that they definitely need, that are
    going to be an instant project, then that's my job to not put forward people that
    are just totally irrelevant. So that's where I sit.

  who: Luke
- header: 'Intro Interview Prep: objectives, structure, and relationship building'
- line: First stage is obviously always going to be the intro meeting. Again, there
    are going to be different ways that companies run this, but typically, it’s 30-40
    minutes of conversation. I guess the key thing that most people are trying to
    get to in the intro stage of an interview is, “Is there synergy between us as
    an organization, the role that we have open, and from a personal perspective?
    Does this make sense?” That's kind of the main goal, but from both sides. The
    prep of that… if you've got any specific questions that you want me to answer
    about that?
  sec: 1686
  time: '28:06'
  who: Luke
- line: What does it look like? Is it like, “Tell us about yourself?” Or is there
    more structure?
  sec: 1726
  time: '28:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Well, the typical questions that I see are really broad, open-ended questions
    like that. But if we're talking about prep, specifically – for me, I think it
    breaks down into 3-4 elements. Number one is the person and character that you're
    going to be speaking to. Because ultimately, in an intro meeting, as much as it's
    about outlining the skills of who you are and what you do, it's about building
    the relationship with that person. Because if you get off a call with someone,
    and you have that kind of internal feeling like “Yeah, that's kind of the thing
    that we're looking for from both sides, but he/she was a dick.” That's not really
    gonna go past that first initial stage. Point number one is going to be about
    the character that you're going to be speaking to and the relationship between
    those people. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1733
  time: '28:53'
  who: Luke
- line: I’m just trying to understand how it helps me as a candidate. Okay, I know
    that the person I will be speaking to is a data science manager in this company
    (for example). What are my actions? Do I research them on LinkedIn? Do I think
    about what is interesting to them? The way I tell my story, do I use the same
    language that they will relate to? How do I use this information?
  sec: 1795
  time: '29:55'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Interviewer Research: personality signals and communication matching'
- line: There are two elements to that. It's the pre-research and the immediate things
    that you do on the call with that person. If I was going to interview you, Alexey,
    you're a brilliant example of somebody that you can actually research. For a lot
    of people, it’s difficult. But the first thing I do is I really try to understand
    the person that I'm going to speak to. Number one, I would ask the recruiter (or
    the internal person that I'm working with) “What's Alexey like?” Really, really
    simply, “What kind of characteristics does Alexey have? What type of communication
    style has Alexey got?” I'd really want to try and gauge who you are before we
    jump on the calls so there's as little surprises as possible.
  sec: 1826
  time: '30:26'
  who: Luke
- line: The person internally that you work with, or externally as a headhunter, I
    would be stripping that person for information because I want to know that when
    I jump on that call, “Is this guy going to be an extroverted, hands-waving-in-the-air
    kind of person? Is he going to be super direct and just get straight to the point?
    What type of character am I actually going to be speaking to here?” Because I
    think the key thing that you need to do in that scenario is work with the person
    that you're talking to. If we've got an ultra direct, straight-to-the-point manager
    of something, and you go in there and you want to shoot the breeze, you're just
    gonna annoy that person. But then equally, if it's the other way around and you're
    super direct, and you just want to get straight to the point and get to it, but
    the other person's like, “Hey, man. How's your day going? What did you get up
    to on the weekend?”
  sec: 1826
  time: '30:26'
  who: Luke
- line: If you don't match, or try to at least match, the energy of the person that
    you're speaking to, there's going to be friction. The point I'm trying to make
    about researching the person before you actually jump into the interview is –
    there are a lot of signals in terms of how people communicate. It will be very
    easy to work you out because you've got podcasts – you can watch them and you
    can see how you can communicate.
  sec: 1826
  time: '30:26'
  who: Luke
- line: But it doesn't mean that I behave like that in an interview, right? Then again,
    I probably do. [chuckles]
  sec: 1947
  time: '32:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would imagine you probably do. Maybe there would be a slight gear shift,
    but I would say that around 80%.
  sec: 1956
  time: '32:36'
  who: Luke
- line: You’re right.
  sec: 1966
  time: '32:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: The way that people communicate online gives you a lot of signals about how
    that person is going to communicate in real life. Even the way that they would
    explain what their roles are on LinkedIn, for example. I do this all the time,
    but if I jump onto a LinkedIn profile now, and I'm making huge assumptions here,
    but usually, I can get a really good feel for that person before we even jump
    on a call. Then when we jump on it, I’ll see “Oh, yeah. That kind of makes sense.”
  sec: 1967
  time: '32:47'
  who: Luke
- line: Just in terms of the communication style, how they write about what they do
    – just that their writing communication will typically fold over to who they are
    as a human being. What's the point? Sorry, I'm rambling here. Before the intro
    meeting, I want to really understand or try to gain as much information about
    the type of person that I'm going to be speaking to – not about the topics and
    the content. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1967
  time: '32:47'
  who: Luke
- line: You do this, right? I guess, in this case, when you're working with the client
    and you’re helping the candidate, you already did this homework, right? Then you
    would tell the candidate, “Hey, this is the person you're going to speak to. This
    is their personality. They prefer to be direct. So get to the point.” [Luke agrees]
    But let's say if somebody is not as lucky to work with you, say they’re going
    through a different process, then this is something they can do on their own.
    They can look at the LinkedIn profile, look up the person on Google, maybe there
    are some podcast appearances or talks, maybe there is something that can help
    to understand the personality of this person.
  sec: 2021
  time: '33:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Don't get me wrong, this is not an exact science. So it's not something
    that if you follow this process, you're gonna get it right 100% of the time. Some
    people just don't even post on LinkedIn and they've got no online community. So
    how can you work out anything from that?
  sec: 2073
  time: '34:33'
  who: Luke
- line: Or no online presence at all, right?
  sec: 2088
  time: '34:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. So don't get me wrong. But you want to use these as signals.
    You don't want to make any absolutes before we jump into that call. You want to
    think, “I think this is the type of person that he or she is going to be like.”
    If you can kind of get to a stage where you're like, “Well, this is the type of
    person that I’m gonna be talking to. This is the type of character. This is the
    type of personality.” You can start to adjust how you communicate to that person.
    But the second part, in terms of the intro meeting, is that you need to really
    quickly assess the person on the other end of the Zoom call, or directly in front
    of you, or on the phone call, within literally seconds of speaking to that person.
  sec: 2089
  time: '34:49'
  who: Luke
- line: People will tend to communicate in the way that they want to communicate.
    If you ever have a zoom call with me, I'm like, “Hey! How's it going?” And that's
    how I communicate as a person. I'm full of emojis and I'm super expressive and
    that kind of stuff. When someone links with me on that, the calls really do well.
    But when I have a call with someone, and I'm like, “Hey!” and they're like, “Hello.
    [stoically] I'm like, “I need to change the way I am right now, otherwise, I'm
    going to be jarring for this person and they're going to think I'm a dick.” There's
    a website that I will send – I'll put it on the document – It's called 16 Personalities,
    which is essentially psychoanalysis of different personality types, and different
    communication styles. I recommend it to anyone who's interviewing to really try
    to understand at least their own, but have a good understanding of who other people
    can be and how they like to communicate.
  sec: 2089
  time: '34:49'
  who: Luke
- line: Because the first initial 10 seconds of conversation, if you don't pick up
    on that, and then you continue going down a road of jarring, completely different
    energy level, be that one way or another, the call (again, I don't want to be
    in absolutes) but 9 times out of 10, people will be on opposite ends of the spectrum
    in terms of how they're trying to communicate to each other. So for me, I always
    try and work out the personality character and the person before I do any prep.
    Because the way that you communicate to that person is going to be one of the
    most important things you can do. The content is obviously important, but if you
    deliver it in a way that doesn't land, it's kind of irrelevant.
  sec: 2089
  time: '34:49'
  who: Luke
- line: Also it's important not just for interviews, right? Pretty much everything
    else too, like meeting, networking, etc.
  sec: 2230
  time: '37:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. There's probably been times in everyone's life where
    they've had a conversation with someone and they just instantly click. They're
    just like, “Phew. We get each other. We're on the same wavelength.”
  sec: 2242
  time: '37:22'
  who: Luke
- line: Probably they have the same personality, right?
  sec: 2258
  time: '37:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yep. It's the same communication style. You’re singing from the same hymn
    sheet and you're communicating in a way that the other person likes to communicate
    and understands and it's natural. But in interviews, obviously, you don't have
    the privilege of choosing who interviews you. It's not like they're one of your
    friends or whatever. So you have to deal with the person in front of you. And
    I think that understanding the personality type of the person that you're talking
    to, doing your research about that individual will give you at least a good start.
  sec: 2261
  time: '37:41'
  who: Luke
- line: I took a look at the time and realized that the topic for this interview is
    technical interview. I love the topic. This is really interesting – 16 personalities
    and how you assess the person. Anything else you want to mention regarding the
    intro meeting before we move on to technical?
  sec: 2294
  time: '38:14'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Message Preparation: elevator pitches and STAR storytelling'
- line: 'Yeah, there''s one more thing. Typically, you''ll have standardized questions:
    “Tell me a bit about you. What''s your background? Tell me about some projects
    that you''ve worked on. What are you looking for?” All the normal everyday recruitment
    stuff. One more final thing on the intro call is – there''s a lot more in the
    document, but just one more for now – I would highly recommend standardizing your
    answers to that and practicing them so that they are really fluent and so you
    can articulate who you are, what you do, what you''re looking for, projects you''ve
    worked on, examples of things that you''ve done – just on demand. So if someone
    says “Alexey, tell me about a project that you''ve worked on that you''re proud
    of.” “Cool. Here it is.”'
  sec: 2315
  time: '38:35'
  who: Luke
- line: It should be like an elevator pitch for pretty much everything. Right? The
    story about yourself, a bunch of projects you worked on – you should have a story
    prepared for that, which ties back to the point. And if they ask for them, explain
    the details.
  sec: 2361
  time: '39:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The STAR methodology, if no one's ever heard of that, it's “Situation
    Task Action Result”. It's a good thing to work towards, but if you practice enough,
    you can get to a certain point. It can sometimes feel a bit rigid. If you're like,
    “Hey, like, this is the situation. This is the task. This was my action.” That's
    gonna come across a bit manufactured. But if you can stick to that and wrap it
    into the normal way that you communicate, so that you've done it so many times
    that it just becomes second nature.
  sec: 2377
  time: '39:37'
  who: Luke
- line: It's a good framework to work towards. But yeah, standardized questions –
    you know pretty much what they're going to talk to you about and what they're
    going to ask you. It's going to be a get-to-know, there's going to be some standard
    questions. Get some good examples, work on them, have them, so they’re on demand,
    ready to go, and you come across really articulate. I think you don't want to
    get called out on, “Hey, man. Tell me about you.” And you just freeze.
  sec: 2377
  time: '39:37'
  who: Luke
- line: I mean, I might if I don't practice. I would say the last time I had an interview
    was three or four years ago. I might get stuck and then start talking about my
    historical childhood. Probably not what they’re looking for.
  sec: 2432
  time: '40:32'
  who: Alexey

    technical interviewing.

    Slido just won't load. Please put them in the live chat and I will be able to
    see them from the live chat. I don’t know what happened to Slido, but I imagined
    that 43 people on this stream right now probably have a few questions. I unfortunately
    cannot access them, so please put them in the live chat. We can maybe move on
    to the technical part.

    questions? What else?
  sec: 2495
  time: '41:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'I think probably, there''s mainly three, maybe four key things in the technical
    part. Number one: binary questions. “What''s the answer to this? What is the correct
    answer to this?” Number two, “What would you do?” Or “what if” situations. So
    that’s “What happens if this happens? How would you deal with that?” Example based
    questions like “Tell me about a time that you did this.”'
  sec: 2508
  time: '41:48'
  who: Luke
- line: 'Then lastly, coding: challenges, coding tasks and stuff like that. That''s
    typically what''s in the technical interview. Again, this is why we need to be
    fairly generic here – most companies or all companies are quite different from
    how they run their interviews. This isn''t the blueprint of how it works, but
    generally, there''ll be some kind of technical session in the middle. How companies
    frame that is different from business.'
  sec: 2508
  time: '41:48'
  who: Luke
- line: What are typical questions that you see? Of course, companies are different.
    If you interview with 100 companies, you will probably get 100 independent questions.
    But some of these questions will probably be similar. Like in an interview for
    data scientists, we will see some that come up pretty often. What kind of questions
    are they usually? Theory of coding, maybe?
  sec: 2574
  time: '42:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I'm with you. It's very closely aligned to those four types of things.
    Again, all companies (and this is part of the prep) will have different expectations
    in what they're going to speak to you about. For me, I would never prepare for
    specific questions – I would practice questions in case they come up. But when
    it comes to preparation for technical interviews, what we need to do is really
    try to understand the expectations of the individual customers that we're trying
    to work with – the individual companies that we're trying to join.
  sec: 2602
  time: '43:22'
  who: Luke
- line: The questions – I mean, I can tell you some, but they're not going to be relevant
    for everyone else. But what is relevant is setting the expectations or trying
    to understand the expectations of the clients that you're interviewing with. Again,
    if you had someone on the inside or HR talent person that you're working with,
    or a recruiter – when you get to a technical interview, the first thing that you
    should be asking is, “What are the expectations of this interview?”
  sec: 2602
  time: '43:22'
  who: Luke
- line: You should never ever, in my opinion, go into an interview and say “It's a
    technical interview.” And that's all you know. That is blasphemy in my world.
    [chuckles] Every single time you go into any interview, you should really understand,
    at least from an agenda perspective, the context of what you're going into and
    speaking about. You need something to base your prep off of. Number one is… [cross-talk]
  sec: 2602
  time: '43:22'
  who: Luke
- header: 'Aligning Expectations: clarifying technical depth with recruiters'
- line: So you do this before – let's say I am working with you, I passed the introduction
    stage, and now you have a technical interview with somebody like a senior data
    scientist. So what do I do? Do I ask you or do I ask that person, “What are your
    expectations?” in an email before the interview so I know what to expect? Is that
    what you're saying?
  sec: 2696
  time: '44:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Let's say you got through the intro stage and that all went really well.
    You say “I'm really keen to continue. What's the next stage? And what are the
    expectations? We're in that technical stage, I should be able to give you a very
    strong or at least some pointers in terms of what they're going to be looking
    for within that technical stage. That's kind of the baseline for your preparation.
    What we don't want to do is go really broad, really generic, and not really know
    what goal we're shooting at. Yes, there are some really good sites out there –
    we can go and practice coding questions and LeetCode and HackerRank and Codeforces
    and stuff like that.
  sec: 2724
  time: '45:24'
  who: Luke
- line: But generally, I think when we are prepping for an organization, we want to
    keep it as focused towards emphasis as we possibly can, which links back onto
    – I would only recommend that you do this, if this is like the role that you actually
    want and this is the company that you actually want, because it takes time. You
    need to look at the organizations and firstly, you want to ask the question, because
    that's going to give you a good baseline to work on. But then secondly, you want
    to start looking at the individual job specs and roles that you're applying for
    and interviewing for, and start to work out the levels of essential vs secondary
    vs ideal skills. That's going to give you the prep, and that's going to give you
    the direction of how much time you put on the prep.
  sec: 2724
  time: '45:24'
  who: Luke
- line: For me, I'd much rather the candidates that I work with spend a ton of time
    focused on really getting up to scratch on the core essentials of the role, spending
    20% of their prep time on secondary skills, and then if we've got any time leftover
    throughout that prep stage, work out what else is ideal – other things that might
    be really beneficial to the role but aren't essential or secondary. The questions
    for me are important because with the customers I've worked with, I do know some
    of the specific questions that they would ask. But I don't share them with candidates,
    because then it will become unfair. Like if I said, “This is exactly what they're
    going to ask you,” then that's not fair, right? [Alexey agrees] So I'll give people
    pointers about the areas of what's going to get spoken about and then I'll set
    the expectations for how much they should know, or how much they should be able
    to articulate themselves within those particular things.
  sec: 2724
  time: '45:24'
  who: Luke

    concepts like “We don't need to go too deep.” Things like that, right?
  sec: 2881
  time: '48:01'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Prep Prioritization: fundamentals first, then secondary and ideal skills'
- line: Yeah, for sure. I always think it's like – if you imagine three circles of
    depth, the first point is fairly basic, everyone should understand points about
    this. I would never skip over those points, because candidates sometimes when
    you think that you know, but if you've not been asked to articulate for a while,
    the fundamentals are always really important. So I never say skip over the basic
    questions and the basic knowledge because I think that if you get asked a question
    that's fairly simple, and something that you probably do on a day-to-day basis,
    but you don't know how to articulate that in a really fluid way, how they read
    that is “Do you actually know this?” [cross-talk]
  sec: 2890
  time: '48:10'
  who: Luke
- line: It's like you know the answer but then you start rambling without really answering,
    right?
  sec: 2940
  time: '49:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. To give you an example, one of the questions that catches loads of candidates
    out from one of the clients that I work with, is “What do generators and decorators
    do?” Tons of people use them and they know them, but to articulate what they do
    – some people get really caught up on that. Then they look at that candidate and
    think “Didn't really know it. Didn't really explain himself or herself very well
    on that particular point.” And then it's obviously a red flag, but a cross next
    to your name in terms of one of the particular things.

  who: Luke
- line: I always say definitely think about the fundamentals so you don't get caught
    up on anything that you know, that you could easily work with, but just for some
    reason – interview nerves, being pressured in an interview, whatever – you just,
    you screwed that part up. Anyway, first circle – essential things, real high priority,
    and the fundamentals. Secondary – how do we level that up now? What's the more
    difficult version of this? And if I was interviewing you, “What would my question
    be that's going to be a follow up question to what I've just answered? How do
    we make that question I've just answered correctly 10 times harder? What’s the
    natural follow up stage there?”
  sec: 2945
  time: '49:05'
  who: Luke
- line: That's what I do, usually. I don’t have a list of questions I asked, I just
    say “Tell me about the project you worked on.” Then the person tells me about
    the project and they say, “Okay, I used this model (random forest, for example).”
    And then I turn to them and say “Tell me about how random forest works.” And then
    I start digging – every time you say something, I try to pull up. [Luke agrees]
    I guess some people have different skill sets. Some people just get those questions
    and then they maybe don't dig deeper, but want to check the breadth of your knowledge.
    Right?
  sec: 3023
  time: '50:23'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Question Flow Strategy: follow-ups to probe deeper understanding'
- line: Yeah. But then if that is the case, we should know that. Right? If someone's
    going in for a “breadth interview”, where they want to see how much you know in
    cloud, and X, and Y, and Z, and all of these areas, then that's what we should
    be prepping for. But we can't do that if we don't know the expectations from the
    business or from the recruiter or from the internal talent person.
  sec: 3060
  time: '51:00'
  who: Luke
- line: I always think that all businesses should not give people the answers and
    not give people so much information that they can kind of walk through the interview
    process easily. Because it does need to be, in my opinion, tough and we need to
    work out that people can actually do it and they can think for themselves and
    all that sort of stuff. But you can't set people up to fail. You can't be like
    “Turn up for a technical interview and we'll see how you go.” That, for me, is
    bullshit. I think we definitely need to at least have context about what's going
    to get spoken about and then you can prep for it. But then it still follows the
    same principle in my eyes. “What's the follow up question to this particular thing?
    What kind of flowchart would I ask candidates?” Or “What would I ask myself if
    I was interviewing that will make this difficult?”
  sec: 3060
  time: '51:00'
  who: Luke
- line: That gives you a lot more of a free flowing prep, rather than being like,
    “I think they're going to talk about this. I think they're going to talk about
    that.” Realistically, if we're talking about this particular subject, most companies
    interview in the same sort of way as you do. So let's talk about this particular
    question and see how they answer it, and then stem from that particular answer.
    If I was a machine learning engineer or a data scientist, this is how I would
    prepare. I'd be like, “Right. Let's start on something that we definitely know
    is gonna get spoken about. Outside of that. How do we work around that and build
    more breadth, but also depth within that particular thing?” [chuckles]
  sec: 3060
  time: '51:00'
  who: Luke
- header: 'Theory vs. Practice: relevance of mathematical and theoretical questions'
- line: I'm just thinking, “How do I stop you?” [laughs] [cross-talk] It’s fine. I’m
    joking. I see that we have three questions. Maybe it's time we actually covered
    them. The first question is “What do you think of companies that mainly ask very
    theoretical questions? As in, data scientists should all know mathematical and
    statistical formulas.”
  sec: 3178
  time: '52:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's if it's relevant for that business, then it's valid. But I think…
  sec: 3202
  time: '53:22'
  who: Luke
- line: How often is it relevant? Sometimes I feel like people don't know what to
    ask at the interview – they just Google a list of questions and this list is theoretical.
    So they just fire off these questions.
  sec: 3210
  time: '53:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. If it's completely abstract, “These are our interview questions for
    no other reason, apart from these are kind of the right things that you would
    ask in an interview for a data scientist.” Then no, that's bullshit. All of the
    interviews, in my opinion, should work backwards from the job responsibilities
    and what they're going to do on a day-to-day basis. If that's something that they're
    never going to touch or don't need to know, then why ask it? What's the point?
  sec: 3221
  time: '53:41'
  who: Luke
- line: Because you studied this at university, and you feel like everyone should
    also know the answers to these questions?
  sec: 3249
  time: '54:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I've heard that before from clients I've worked with. But how much impact
    does that have on a candidate's ability to do the job right now if they can recall
    something that they’ve learned 6, 7, 8, 9 years ago of a very specific thing?
    What impact is that going to have on if they can do that right now? I guess the
    flip side to that is – no, I don't think there’s a flip side, actually. I think
    they’re bullshit. [chuckles]
  sec: 3257
  time: '54:17'
  who: Luke
- line: How do you keep going with an interview if you've flopped in between and feel
    uncomfortable? What does “flopped” mean? It’s like if you’ve failed?
  sec: 3294
  time: '54:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: If they've just bombed it.
  sec: 3305
  time: '55:05'
  who: Luke
- line: “Bombed” means if you failed, right?
  sec: 3308
  time: '55:08'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 3313
  time: '55:13'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Recovering from Failure: bombing interviews, feedback, and retakes'
- line: Sorry, man. [laughs] I guess it depends. Sorry, I know it's a really awful
    answer. But I guess it depends on how you’ve bombed and how that feels in the
    scenario. It'd be good if they could give me a little bit more of a specific but…
    and it depends if you really want that job. If I've bombed (and I’ve bombed in
    an interview before, absolutely [laughs]) but I really wanted to work there. It
    didn't work out in the end, but I've got nothing to lose at this stage, right?
  sec: 3317
  time: '55:17'
  who: Luke
- line: So if you bombed in an interview and you think “I can do better than that.
    That was just a really bad day for me.” I'd tell them. I would go back. And I've
    had multiple people that I've worked with, who have bombed interviews and I've
    said, “Look, take four weeks. We're going to prep on these particular things that
    you absolutely bombed on. And then we're going to retake that interview with that
    client.” And people have got jobs from that.
  sec: 3317
  time: '55:17'
  who: Luke
- line: Ah. That’s cool. So it happens.
  sec: 3377
  time: '56:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. 100%.
  sec: 3381
  time: '56:21'
  who: Luke
- line: For me, when I bomb something – when I fail something – then I just think,
    “Okay, I should have answered it this way.” And then I do some research and understand,
    “Okay, this is what the answer should be.” And then they just don't do anything
    else – the next time this question comes up, maybe I’ll answer it better, but
    that's it. But what you’re saying is, instead of just working through this and
    thinking of a better answer, you reach out to the company and say, “Look, I had
    a bad day. I did a bit of thinking and I want to retake it.” Some companies actually
    agree to the interview four weeks later?
  sec: 3383
  time: '56:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: And then they take those people in the end, yeah. There are three examples
    I've got in my mind right now of people that have done that over the past year
    with me. But anyway, if you've bombed an interview, this all depends on if you
    really want it. If you really want it, then what have you got to lose? You should
    definitely go for it. But if you’ve bombed an interview and you think, “Oh, this
    is not for me anyway.” I would just wrap that interview up really quickly and
    then just get out of there.
  sec: 3424
  time: '57:04'
  who: Luke
- line: But if you think “I’ve bombed that and I want it.” It’s exactly how you said
    – I would message the person that's just interviewed me and I would be like, “Alexey,
    I’ve absolutely bombed that interview and that was awful. I can 100% do better
    than that. Would you just do me a favor and give me three to four weeks? Let me
    come back and retake that. Can we do that?” Most people would say “Yeah.”
  sec: 3424
  time: '57:04'
  who: Luke
- line: I'm just wondering what I would do if I received a request like that – what
    a recruiter would tell me to do. I've never received a request like that. So anyone
    that's listening to this interview right now and then will have an interview with
    me, and hopefully you don't, but in case it happens.
  sec: 3477
  time: '57:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Just one more thing on that. The risk there is that, if you do that and then
    you bomb again.
  sec: 3502
  time: '58:22'
  who: Luke
- line: Oh, yeah. [chuckles] Oops.
  sec: 3508
  time: '58:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: I've had that and it is heartbreaking to be like, “Sorry, man. You still weren't
    good enough.” That's the risk that you take. But if you really want the thing
    that you're going after, I would take that risk. Every day.
  sec: 3510
  time: '58:30'
  who: Luke
- header: 'Applying Internally: focused applications and direct outreach tactics'
- line: A question from Alvin. “Is it okay to apply to different roles in the same
    company within a short amount of time?”
  sec: 3527
  time: '58:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: If it's relevant, yeah. But I wouldn't pepper gun the company and apply for
    everything. There are some people that would look at that and think, “Oh, that's
    a bad sign.” I don't really see it as a bad sign. I just think it's a bit lazy
    to be like “Apply all” or “click, click, click, click, click,” because I've seen
    people that have applied for work-student jobs and then senior and principal engineers.
    You're not looking at what you're doing, right? I don't think it's a bad thing,
    but just make sure it's super relevant and just keep it focused towards what you
    actually want to do.
  sec: 3537
  time: '58:57'
  who: Luke
- line: But I think we spoke about this last time – I think the best thing you can
    do is actually just reach out to the right people and speak to them directly,
    otherwise, you just get put into a black hole of 10,000 other applications and
    you’ll probably never be contacted. For me, the standing out part is about being
    different and doing something differently. I would personally just reach out to
    the people and say “This is what I want to do and this is the impact I can have
    with you guys. These are the roles I'm thinking about. What should I apply for
    and where should I go?”
  sec: 3537
  time: '58:57'
  who: Luke
- header: 'Practice Resources: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, Educative'
- line: Yeah, I can add to that. I also see nothing wrong with that. We sometimes
    have positions that look similar, but they're from different teams. Talk to the
    recruiter on the first interview and say, “Yeah, I applied to other positions,
    too.” We should be wrapping up. So the last thing I want to ask you is if you
    have any book or other resource recommendations that you can give to the listeners.
  sec: 3605
  time: '1:00:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Yeah. Regarding this document, I’ll tell you all now: LeetCode, HackerRank,
    Codeforces, AlgoMonster, Educative ( I don’t know if you''ve ever heard them before).
    Really, all of that – if you want to practice just questions and interview questions,
    and engineering questions, and science questions – they''re really, really good.
    I know there''s a lot of controversy about LeetCode questions and all of this
    sort of stuff, but companies run interviews like that. So if you want to practice,
    those are really good places to start.'
  sec: 3636
  time: '1:00:36'
  who: Luke
- line: But then equally, as I said, this document that I'm putting together about
    interview prep – I'm really sorry we didn't get to really dive into a lot of topics
    today. This document, I'm going to work on it, and I'm going to expand on it.
    If anyone wants it, reach out to me on LinkedIn and give me a couple of days to
    make it look like it's not been written by a five year old, and then I'll happily
    share that with everyone.
  sec: 3636
