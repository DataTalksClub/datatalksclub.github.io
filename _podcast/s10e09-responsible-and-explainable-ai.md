short: Responsible and Explainable AI
title: Responsible and Explainable AI
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about responsible and Explainable AI. We have a special
    guest today, Supreet. Supreet is an assistant VP in data strategy at Morgan Stanley.
    She's also the founder of DataBuzz. So she will probably tell us a bit about what
    that is. She's a writer, she's a speaker, and she loves communicating what she
    knows on different platforms. It's my pleasure to have you today. Hi.
  sec: 94
  time: '1:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you for having me on the show.
  sec: 131
  time: '2:11'
  who: Supreet
- header: Supreet’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of explainable and responsible AI, let's
    start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 134
  time: '2:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. In 2017, I came to the states to pursue my Master’s as a student from
    India, the capital city. I started my Master's of business and science – it’s
    a combination of MBA and MS in data science – a very unique degree. Then I started
    my career in January 2019 as a data science consultant. I was a data science and
    technology consultant for three years before I decided to switch gears a little
    bit and be more involved in the strategy as I realized the importance of that
    in my early career years.
  sec: 145
  time: '2:25'
  who: Supreet
- line: After these few years of chatting with so many ambitious people who want to
    pivot in this technology and data science, I realized that there was something
    that I could do out there to help everyone and hence, I started the community,
    DataBuzz, to mentor people who want to pivot in this way. I've had a very unique
    career journey, I would say, from a non-traditional, non-engineering background
    pivoting into this field. That’s what the goal of DataBuzz is.
  sec: 145
  time: '2:25'
  who: Supreet
- line: Well, that's interesting. We will probably spend a bit more time talking about
    that. I'm quite curious to know more about this. I'm also interested in your title,
    which is Assistant VP in Data Strategy. I'm really curious, what does it mean?
    What do you do in your day-to-day job?
  sec: 214
  time: '3:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, of course. Morgan Stanley's definitely a big firm. We have different
    divisions – we have asset management, investment banking, wealth management and
    so forth. I'm in the analytics and data team for wealth management, and the data
    strategy and products team basically owns different AI-driven products.
  sec: 234
  time: '3:54'
  who: Supreet
- line: We are the product owners who ensure that the data strategy is streamlined.
    We also introduce new data ideas into the stream, and obviously create different
    AI products, help launch different AI products in Morgan Stanley. We work very
    closely with data science to make everything happen.
  sec: 234
  time: '3:54'
  who: Supreet
- line: So you're more on the analytical side of the data.
  sec: 274
  time: '4:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely more on the analytical side, yeah.
  sec: 219
  time: '3:39'
  who: Supreet
- header: Responsible AI
- line: Today’s topic is responsible AI. So what is responsible AI? How can AI be
    responsible?
  sec: 283
  time: '4:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's definitely a very interesting field and it's a very budding field,
    I would say. I've been in this regulated environment. I've been in finance for
    three plus years now, so I have definitely appreciated responsible AI and trustworthy
    AI. As the name suggests, it's all about developing algorithms and processes so
    that you can empower your employees and users or customers.
  sec: 292
  time: '4:52'
  who: Supreet
- line: There have been numerous studies out there that say that if your consumers
    and customers trust you with the outcome, they'll invest in you. It's as simple
    as that. It's basically a collaborative way of working with other stakeholders,
    with keeping your end users informed and being able to integrate everyone's feedback,
    ultimately making this a very collaborative process.
  sec: 292
  time: '4:52'
  who: Supreet
- line: What does that actually mean? Does it mean that if they trust us then we're
    responsible because we don't want to violate this trust? What does it mean to
    be responsible here? We're responsible for data, for the decision that our machine
    learning and the AI systems make, right? And we don't want to lose this trust
    that people put in us? Right?
  sec: 351
  time: '5:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. You basically have the right tools in place so that all your stakeholders
    and users feel confident about the decisions. So if anyone asks you, “How did
    you arrive at this outcome?” You have some tool – you have something to show that,
    “Okay, this is the step. This is what my algorithm followed and we were able to
    arrive at this decision.” So I would say that it’s tools and frameworks to empower
    you.
  sec: 374
  time: '6:14'
  who: Supreet
- header: Example of explainable AI
- line: I'm just trying to think of an example. Can you maybe use some examples from
    your work, or maybe something that you can talk about where this is important?
    You said “We want to feel confident in this prediction, and we want to be able
    to explain how they happen, so that we have this trust.” Can you give us an example
    of that?
  sec: 402
  time: '6:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Of course. A few months back, an article came out where there was a husband
    and a wife – both of them are eligible for a credit card with the same limit,
    but the wife ended up receiving a lower limit than the husband. There was a big
    lawsuit against the company, because she felt that somewhere, the AI was biased
    towards her just because she was a female and maybe the algorithm ultimately assumed
    that she had a lower income and gave her a lower limit credit card.
  sec: 426
  time: '7:06'
  who: Supreet
- line: So this is where, if you have the process in place, you are able to justify
    why the wife got that limit, and why the husband got a certain limit. Even before
    that, you are able to check – did your data actually have bias in it? And you
    can curb that so that you can produce a fair decision. There are two sides of
    the coin, I would say. The first is your data side, which has to be checked in
    terms of accuracy and fairness. Then there are your model’s predictions. Because
    if your data is biased, there’s no way that you're going to get unbiased predictions.
  sec: 426
  time: '7:06'
  who: Supreet
- header: Responsible AI vs explainable AI
- line: What is the relationship between responsible AI and explainable AI? From what
    I hear now – if we want to feel confident in the predictions, we need to be able
    to explain them. Does this mean that responsible AI is explainable AI? Or what's
    the connection there?
  sec: 500
  time: '8:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think I will definitely deep dive into explainable AI and talk more
    about that. Explainable AI is more like a post mortem report, I would say. [chuckles]
    An incident has happened and now “Okay, what do you need to do? Okay, let's build
    a simple algorithm and justify that it’s good.” Responsible AI is more like, “Okay,
    we have these frameworks in place and your starting point or whenever you are
    building an algorithm or a project, you have all of these tools and frameworks
    in mind. For the incident to not happen anymore, you have these tools in place.”
    So it's more of a mindset. Explainable AI just gives you the authority, or I would
    say the tools, to build those frameworks. I can deep dive into some of the practical
    techniques that you can use to implement explainable AI in your day-to-day practice.
  sec: 518
  time: '8:38'
  who: Supreet
- line: Okay. So what you're saying is that we should try to prevent these situations,
    like in the example of a husband and wife getting different credit proposals.
    Ideally, we should not let this even happen. We should catch all the bias we have
    in our data and try to mitigate it before we train our credit scoring system.
    When the credit scoring system is live, then we should be able to justify it.
    So if the wife, in this case, comes to the financial institution and asks, “Why
    did you give me a lower loan?” The bank would just say, “Okay. This, this, and
    this are the reasons.” But if we don't have that, then we have a problem. Right?
  sec: 577
  time: '9:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Yeah.'
  sec: 629
  time: '10:29'
  who: Supreet
- header: Explainable AI tools and frameworks (glass box approach)
- line: You mentioned tools and you mentioned a framework. So how do we do this?
  sec: 630
  time: '10:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is where I think it's the right point to explain some of the explainable
    AI techniques. So what is Explainable AI, essentially? It's a framework that can
    be integrated with your existing machine learning models, so that you can understand
    the output of your AI or ML algorithms. As I said, this is not only used to explain
    the results behind a machine learning algorithm, but you can use it to receive
    feedback so that you can retrain your model, you can use it to detect bias in
    your data. It's called the glass box approach. As they say, “Oh, AI/machine learning
    is a black box.” But here, you're giving transparency and it's called the glass
    box.
  sec: 636
  time: '10:36'
  who: Supreet
- line: Glass box. I heard “white box” before, but I was always thinking and wondering,
    “Is white really transparent?” It’s just as opaque as black, right? [chuckles]
    Glass box makes much more sense.
  sec: 681
  time: '11:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Yeah. I will start with the data level. First, when we talk about
    the data level, we talk about fairness and bias testing. There, you have a few
    data quality checks that I feel every data scientist does. They do some sort of
    exploratory analysis, dig into the data, see what they have. We can do a few checks
    there as well. One of them is skewness – you could check what your data looks
    like and it could be that you are missing out on one population or the other,
    then your data is highly skewed. The other could be missing data.'
  sec: 696
  time: '11:36'
  who: Supreet
- line: If you have too much missing data, it's important to analyze what you are
    missing. You might be able to talk to business stakeholders and get a sense of
    “Are we missing out on an entire population?” So these are some simple checks
    that can be done on the data side to ensure that your data is not biased and you're
    covering a wide array of populations. This is one of them. Then on the model side,
    you have different techniques. But I'm just going to pause to see if there are
    any questions or any comments on the data side?
  sec: 696
  time: '11:36'
  who: Supreet
- header: Checking for bias in data and handling personal data
- line: Well, there is a question, “What tools do we use to check if there is any
    bias in the data?” I think this is related to what you were talking about. This
    is before we train a model, right? You talked about EDA (exploratory data analysis)
    , you talked about skewness analysis, and missing data. Are there any particular
    tools and techniques that we can use to check this?
  sec: 768
  time: '12:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is more on the EDA side. You're not doing anything – you're just exploring
    the data, honestly. You're just analyzing “What's out there? What does my input
    look like?” Then when you actually dig deep into this, it's kind of more of like
    a conscious check plus a technical check. But here is where you will see, “What
    is happening? What is happening exactly?”
  sec: 796
  time: '13:16'
  who: Supreet
- line: Then I would also say that there are these bias checks that you can do. Now,
    bias is a very subjective term. Bias can occur in a lot of shapes and forms. There’s
    a book called Trustworthy AI – I don't know how many of you have read it – where
    the author talks about different types of bias. She says that it can be like a
    gambler's fallacy, which is that the probability of a random event that occurs
    in the future is influenced by a past event. And that is what we assume when we
    are building AI models most of the time – that my history is the correct representation
    of my future. But that is not always true and that's where you need the human
    touch to check for such biases in your data and in your model.
  sec: 796
  time: '13:16'
  who: Supreet
- line: So basically you need to, as a human – as an analyst or as a data scientist
    – you need to get your dataset from your database, CSV file, whatever, and just
    spend enough time trying to understand what's happening there. Right? Should we
    watch out for anything particular? Let's say, if we see columns like age and gender,
    should we already think “red flag”? Should we do something about these columns?
    Or what does it usually look like?
  sec: 879
  time: '14:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I would actually say it depends, because age and gender and those things
    are very PII information – sensitive information. Most organizations wouldn't
    even let you touch [laughs] those attributes, especially if you're in a regulated
    organization. So I’m not sure if you would, first of all, have access to that
    kind of information to even make this judgment.
  sec: 914
  time: '15:14'
  who: Supreet
- line: But there could be other factors – it could be the income of the person, or
    other factors about that person of whatever it is you are doing, that can lead
    you to make some assumptions, predictions, decision, which you would use to check
    back with your business stakeholders or some subject matter expert to see if they're
    even valid or needed.
  sec: 914
  time: '15:14'
  who: Supreet
- line: Okay. So you think these financial institutions that we talked about – banks
    – don't have access to age and gender?
  sec: 965
  time: '16:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it depends on which organization we are talking about. Everyone works
    in a different way. It's kind of a recommendation – How are you handling that
    PII information? In the pharma world, we never had access to all of this data.
    [laughs] Or even if we had it, we wouldn't use it – we’d mask it out.
  sec: 974
  time: '16:14'
  who: Supreet
- line: But in pharma, I guess it's important, right? Because the way drugs work on
    people depends on their age and depends on gender. There it is a justified use
    case. While when building a credit risk profile, maybe it’s less so.
  sec: 995
  time: '16:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I don’t think it’s even a healthcare or a financial institution question
    – it's like a general industry thing. If in your use case, this type of data is
    not required, you wouldn't use sensitive information. Again, this is also responsible
    AI, because you're handling the data of a customer responsibly. Yeah, definitely
    – we do our due diligence in determining “Do we even need this data in the first
    place?”
  sec: 1018
  time: '16:58'
  who: Supreet
- header: Understanding whether your company needs certain type of data
- line: And how do we do this? Is it usually done by this… we talked about data checks
    – to discuss this, should we go into the model checks? To understand whether we
    even need this data?
  sec: 1040
  time: '17:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. When you're determining whatever use case you want to solve,
    you will definitely have a detailed discussion with your product managers, business
    stakeholders, and that is where you will determine what data you need. And if
    it's sensitive information and if you can mask it out, that is where it will get
    out of your data pipeline for your AI models, so you can use other datasets.
  sec: 1055
  time: '17:35'
  who: Supreet
- line: Would it be wise to completely just throw away gender data, let’s say if it’s
    PII?
  sec: 1082
  time: '18:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah, it''ll again depend on the use case. A very typical answer,
    but I don''t think I can answer it any better. It, again, depends on your use
    case, what your SMEs say? What is your compliance? What is your Model Review Committee
    said before you do anything else?'
  sec: 1087
  time: '18:07'
  who: Supreet
- header: Data quality checks and automation
- line: How much of this can be automated? At least when we talk about detecting biases
    in data before we come to modeling?
  sec: 1107
  time: '18:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think for all the missing data, the data skewness, you can always
    develop DQ (data quality) tools that can do all of these simple tests for you
    and tell you – they can actually give you those alarms. Then you can go there
    and investigate – if there is an alarm and you feel that an investigation is needed.
    Most of this can be automated.
  sec: 1117
  time: '18:37'
  who: Supreet
- line: So what about this model part?
  sec: 1143
  time: '19:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. For models, also… I think a few years back, we didn't have as many open
    source technologies. But now we have a lot of those. Google, IBM, everyone has
    such good open source technologies that can easily be fetched into your Python
    pipeline or your PySpark – whichever tool you're using. There is a what-if tool
    by Google – it's almost an interactive tool – where you can understand the data.
    It gives you an interface of the dashboard, so you can basically fetch all your
    parameters, see what's the workings behind a machine learning model, especially
    if you're using TensorFlow, which is again, made by Google. So a what-if tool
    is a great tool to use, then we have other tools as well. We have Skater, which
    is an open source Python library. That was again designed so that you can see
    some of the module functioning. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1148
  time: '19:08'
  who: Supreet
- line: What is it called? I didn't hear the name.
  sec: 1203
  time: '20:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Skater. S K A T E R.
  sec: 1210
  time: '20:10'
  who: Supreet
- line: Skater. Okay.
  sec: 1211
  time: '20:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that is another tool that helps you see the functioning behind the machine
    learning module. Now, the trick is, obviously, how you will integrate in your
    use case will, again, depend on what you're trying to achieve. You might not find
    that all of these tools can be integrated with your use case. There, it's more
    of an exploration, again. Then there's another one – AIX 360 by IBM. That is another
    amazing open source toolkit, which you can use to comprehend your predictions
    and your machine learning model.
  sec: 1214
  time: '20:14'
  who: Supreet
- line: So this one is… I'm just trying to understand. So “what-if” if I understood
    it correctly, you can see this as another exploratory data analysis tool, but
    smarter than the usual analytics, right? So it's smarter than just counting missing
    values. Then you can see… What kind of questions can you ask it? “What if I remove
    this column?” Or “What if I had this data?” What kind of ‘what-if’ questions can
    you ask?
  sec: 1255
  time: '20:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Again, it's more like if you want to also see the importance of some of the
    features – if you want to see, “Okay, what if I remove this feature? How will
    my model get impacted?” If you just want to see what your data looks like, as
    I said, like the skewness and everything, it will easily allow you to do a plot
    and that will be very dynamic. You can do it over time, over months, or years,
    whatever use case you have in hand – so all of those things. And if you were using
    TensorFlow, then how did you arrive at that prediction? What if you remove the
    feature? How will it impact your model? How will it impact your accuracy? All
    of those things.
  sec: 1287
  time: '21:27'
  who: Supreet
- line: And Skater? Does it do something similar to that?
  sec: 1327
  time: '22:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s similar, but it’s not just [audio cuts out] more broad. [chuckles] It's
    more on other models, if you want to use it. Basically, you can do it based on
    your complete data set. Explainable AI, whenever you are doing – you're using
    any framework. The idea of that is, if I were to apply this on a larger dataset,
    what will the impact look like? But whenever you build an explainable AI technique,
    you basically take a small dataset. With that, obviously, there's an assumption
    that this is a true representation of my bigger dataset. And then you build around
    that. Skater will facilitate some of those techniques for you.
  sec: 1332
  time: '22:12'
  who: Supreet
- line: The last one you mentioned is AIX 360 from IBM. My understanding was that
    it's used for interpreting the output – the predictions of the model. Or not only
    that?
  sec: 1376
  time: '22:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, all of these can be used for that. I mean, ultimately, you're using
    all of this. It's just that if you're not using TensorFlow, if you're using other
    open source packages, they'll help you facilitate that.
  sec: 1391
  time: '23:11'
  who: Supreet
- line: I've heard about tools like LIME and Shapley Values. Are these somehow related
    to that too?
  sec: 1404
  time: '23:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: The ones that I just spoke about are more open source Python packages, I would
    say. Now, if you actually want to build things from scratch – the way you will
    actually build any algorithm. That's where LIME comes into play. LIME is a combination
    of different things. You can do a linear regression model, or you can do a decision
    tree model. That is basically building a LIME model.
  sec: 1412
  time: '23:32'
  who: Supreet
- line: Actually, you might be doing a neural network model, but now you just want
    to be able to interpret that. So you, again, take a small data set and build a
    decision tree on that to come close to what the interpretations would look like,
    so that you're able to explain that to your stakeholders. Yes, LIME is very similar
    to that.
  sec: 1412
  time: '23:32'
  who: Supreet
- header: Responsibility vs profitability
- line: I'm quite interested in this. Let's say there are some features that we shouldn't
    use because they're PII (personally identifiable information) like gender and
    age. But in some cases, I kind of wish we could use them. For example, in an advertisement,
    maybe there is a product that would be more appealing to females than males.
  sec: 1462
  time: '24:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: If I decide to be responsible and trustworthy, then I should remove this feature,
    right? But I know that this feature is actually important if I want to be profitable.
    Then I have a dilemma. Do I want to be profitable? Do I want to make money? Or
    do I want to be responsible and remove bias from data? Do I want to get rich by
    exploiting these biases or not? So how can we still be profitable, but without
    exploiting all these biases?
  sec: 1462
  time: '24:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't think all these decisions are made by one person. And they're definitely
    not made by data science practitioners. That is what responsible AI is. It's a
    very collaborative process. That's why they say it – because when you have 10
    different people in a room, discussing such use cases and have 10 different perspectives,
    I would say that you will be able to meet halfway. That is where you will be able
    to decide the priorities of what you really want to do and how you can achieve
    it. That is exactly what we aim to do. It's beyond these techniques that I just
    mentioned. [chuckles]
  sec: 1532
  time: '25:32'
  who: Supreet
- line: But then I guess for this one, let's say if there are 10 people who have different
    perspectives, they should be different people. It's not like all data scientists
    are all white males. Otherwise they probably would think, “Okay, there is nothing
    wrong with using gender. Let's just use it.”
  sec: 1572
  time: '26:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no, no, definitely. I meant different representations from different groups.
    Because data scientists think differently and project managers will think differently.
    Now, you add compliance people, they'll think differently. [laughs] That's what
    I meant and that is why like launching an AI product and doing all of this. Responsibility
    is definitely a journey.
  sec: 1592
  time: '26:32'
  who: Supreet
- line: The reason I’m mentioning it is because, in many courses, and also the courses
    we do at DataTalks.Club, there are datasets – there are some problems – where
    we do actually use age and gender. I think, actually, in the course we have right
    now there are two projects in which we use age and gender. You might think as
    a data scientist, “There is nothing wrong. What’s there to talk about here? Let's
    just use this.” Right? [chuckles]
  sec: 1616
  time: '26:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. And we would never know.  For us, it's all about features.
    “This is important. That's what our algorithm is saying.” We don't really think
    in that direction. [laughs] But yeah, it's important.
  sec: 1644
  time: '27:24'
  who: Supreet
- line: So what kind of people do we need to have in this room to be able to have
    these fruitful discussions? You said that we need, perhaps, data scientists, analysts,
    and people from compliance. Who else should we have?
  sec: 1658
  time: '27:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: You should also have subject matter experts who understand the data better.
    You should have your senior leadership, ultimately, as well. I think, obviously,
    it's not going to be easy [chuckles] to get an answer in one meeting, like “Oh,
    yeah. We’ve decided to come to a conclusion.” I think, at that time, you'll be
    thinking about some innovative workarounds. “Okay, let's use this one feature
    over this feature, and let's see how it performs. Let's drop this feature.” But
    at the end of the day, it's possible that the use case that you have in hand,
    like gender is one of the most important features. Then, again, it's a company's
    decision to make.
  sec: 1672
  time: '27:52'
  who: Supreet
- line: Then I guess – who is making this decision? Is it senior leadership, or everyone?
  sec: 1718
  time: '28:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s collaborative.
  sec: 1726
  time: '28:46'
  who: Supreet

  sec: 1728
  time: '28:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] I don''t think so. I think they’re very productive and, obviously,
    everyone''s responsible. But at the same time, you''re in a business and you want
    to make money. [laughs]'
  sec: 1732
  time: '28:52'
  who: Supreet
- line: But then, what happens at the end, I guess, is you come up with some sort
    of terms of service and then you say, “Okay. This is the data we collect. We collect
    gender.” And if you don't agree with this, you don't use the app? Or how does
    it usually work?
  sec: 1742
  time: '29:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I mean, it's also about the way we do those declarations and the way
    we sign all the terms and agreements, where somewhere the customer might give
    you the consent that “Okay, yeah. Just use my data.” And some customers might
    not give you their consent. So that’s also very competent.
  sec: 1755
  time: '29:15'
  who: Supreet
- line: But I'm still thinking about that example, where the wife and the husband
    – perhaps both of them gave consent to using their gender information. Then at
    the end, this is what happens. The company still got sued, even though they probably
    had paperwork in place. Right?
  sec: 1777
  time: '29:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, I'm not sure. I read it in the newspaper, so I don't know whether
    the company was able to justify that decision or not. We get the news from a third
    party, so you don't really know the facts. But that's what kind of made me think.
    Was the company able to justify? If the consumer is questioning you, are you able
    to justify what led to this difference in your decision? Can you say that it was
    beyond gender? Can you say it was not biased? And you can only say that if you've
    already done your due diligence before, in order to see that there's no bias in
    your data set.
  sec: 1795
  time: '29:55'

    already suing you, it’s too late. Right?

- line: '[laughs] I see. Per my understanding, we should analyze our data – we should
    have a human who actually goes through the dataset. Some things could be automated.
    But then, at the end, a human should actually go through this and do some analytics.
    After that, there are techniques that can automate this, like all these what-if
    tools and similar ones like Skater. That should be used by analysts and data scientists,
    I guess, to make sure that this actually doesn''t happen. Also, at the end, we
    want to be profitable, but at the same time, we want to be trustworthy and responsible.
    Therefore, we should have this meeting with people from compliance, from data
    analytics, subject matter experts, from senior leadership, who get together and
    discuss the case. Am I missing anything?'
  sec: 1848
  time: '30:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no. We also highlighted the challenges on the way. This is one of the
    challenges, as you said – profitability versus being responsible. And then we
    have accuracy versus interpretability. Because for all of your complex models,
    you still might not be able to make an explainable AI model. All of those, I feel,
    are still the challenges and pitfalls of explainable AI and responsible AI?
  sec: 1916
  time: '31:56'
  who: Supreet
- header: The trade-off between model complexity and explainability
- line: Actually, we have a question from Shivam that is exactly about that. The question
    is, “How to manage the trade-off between model complexity and explainability?
    Complex models do not necessarily have good explainability, so how do we manage
    that?”
  sec: 1949
  time: '32:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Again, as I said, that's one of the challenges. In some use cases,
    it's a trade-off. As data scientists, we face other trade-offs – we have the bias
    versus variance trade-off. So this is one of those things where you need to, again,
    analyze what you're trying to achieve, who you're trying to target, and what your
    end goal is. What do you want to achieve? What do your business stakeholders want
    to achieve? And if we were to take a step back on accuracy, will that help us
    in the long term? Will our consumers trust us more? At the end of the day, you're
    also trying to build a brand – it might be a bank or it might be healthcare or
    whatever. You want people to indulge with you in some form or another. So yeah,
    it's one of those crossroads.
  sec: 1965
  time: '32:45'
  who: Supreet
- line: I guess, if you make a decision to prefer accuracy versus explainability,
    you should be prepared that eventually, somebody from senior management (like
    Mark Zuckerberg) will have to talk in front of Congress and explain things. [chuckles]
    If you don't want this to happen, then maybe you don’t… [laughs]
  sec: 2020
  time: '33:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] I hope this doesn''t happen, but yes. It''s not that every time
    you will be choosing “Okay, let me make the most interpretable models.” Every
    time you encounter a use case, your decision making will be different. And that''s
    why it''s important to not make all of these decisions [inaudible].'
  sec: 2043
  time: '34:03'
  who: Supreet
- line: I imagine that if you, let’s say, use linear or logistic regression for everything,
    then it will be not so biased and very explainable, but then the accuracy could
    suffer. But then if you go with deep learning, then it's the opposite side of
    the spectrum – you have little explainability, but a lot of accuracy.
  sec: 2066
  time: '34:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: So what I understand is that you just need to keep the long-term goal of the
    company in mind and ask yourself, “Are we ready to sacrifice our image with some
    extra profit? If people start talking bad about us, or we're an evil corporation
    – it's fine to store all the data about you and then sell it to others.” [chuckles]
    Not pointing fingers. [Supreet laughs]
  sec: 2066
  time: '34:26'
  who: Alexey
- header: Is completely automated AI out of the question?
- line: There is a question from Raquel, “What does ‘you need a human touch’ mean?”
    I think this is related to our discussion, where the first step is always a human
    analyzing the data. Then the question goes on “Does this mean that responsible
    AI and checkpoints and alarms cannot be automated?” Maybe we can think of what
    can be automated and what cannot.
  sec: 2128
  time: '35:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, as I said, all your data quality checks – you can be so creative. You
    can write pieces of codes and you can do all the checks in the world. But at the
    end of the day, you just cannot be like, “Oh, my DQ checks passed. I don't really
    need to look at it and see what's happening.” As your data keeps evolving, your
    tools and even all your production models need to evolve as well. Often, as a
    data scientist, you hear, “Oh, we have drift in our model.” And drift can also
    be in this form. It can be in the form of bias as well. You didn't have biased
    data before, and now you have biased data.
  sec: 2157
  time: '35:57'
  who: Supreet
- line: If you can build adoptable techniques, definitely do that. But at the end
    of the day, there has to be someone who can go in, analyze all of those – you
    obviously don’t have to go row by row [chuckles] but in a cumulative fashion,
    see what's happening with your data and your model performance. That's what I
    mean by “human touch”. At the end of the day, it's a human who's gonna write the
    code as well, to make that happen.
  sec: 2157
  time: '35:57'
  who: Supreet
- line: So a human automates it, right? We automate, but it's the human who is doing
    the automation and they need to put some thought in this process. Not just blindly
    take a tool from Google (or who knows what company) and just put it there and
    forget about it. Right?

  sec: 2250
  time: '37:30'
  who: Supreet
- header: Detecting model drift and overfitting
- line: To your point about drift, we should monitor for bias. There is a comment
    from Abhishek, “If the DataTalks.Club model sees more males attending the events,
    females will not get recommended the event and this can introduce a feedback loop,
    where the next time, the model will recommend the events only to males and ignore
    females.” This is something that happens gradually. At the beginning maybe it's
    equal, but then there is more and more and more and more – a feedback loop. And
    then at the end, it's only males attending the events. Are there tools that can
    help detect this kind of drift, or at least this kind of bias, that gets into
    your model and into your data because of these feedback loops?
  sec: 2251
  time: '37:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I feel like if your model is in production, you are already using some
    sort of tool to monitor your model’s performance. But you might just be measuring
    your performance in terms of accuracy. Now, you also need to build some sort of
    monitoring in terms of the population samples – if it's a male or a female, if
    you already have a unique identifier in your data set, how is your population
    drafting? Basically, all the DQ checks that you did during your input phase, you
    need to redo them even after every time you maybe launch a version of the product
    or every time you're monitoring your product.
  sec: 2308
  time: '38:28'
  who: Supreet
- line: It's basically about integrating those two pieces. I don't think there's just
    one tool that will be able to solve your problem. I feel like it will vary from
    problem to problem and then you will get creative when building. But basic statistics,
    I think, all of us can do. Mean, median, mode – basic statistics to find out,
    “Okay, what is the mean of my data? How is my population? What does the sample
    size look like?” All of those will also give you at least a view of what's happening.
    And then you can use that.
  sec: 2308
  time: '38:28'
  who: Supreet
- line: I imagine if we only monitor for accuracy, then in this example of this feedback
    loop, the model will maybe become 100% accurate.
  sec: 2380
  time: '39:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Again, overfitting and that’s an alarm.
  sec: 2390
  time: '39:50'
  who: Supreet
- line: Yeah, yeah – exactly. And then from the model performance point of view, it's
    kind of doing well, right? Everyone who comes enjoys the event – maybe it has
    high precision, but the recall is bad. We are missing out on other people who
    might enjoy it, but simply because the model overfit, they don't get to see this
    in the recommendation kit. Then the way to monitor this is by checking these basic
    stats, like looking at some demographic information.
  sec: 2393
  time: '39:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Demographic information, yes. And the way you actually do it for drift, also
    – there are these KS tools. I mean, there are a lot of tools in the market. Even
    AWS, if you're using it in your notebook instance, you have these tools where
    you can include all these basic statistics. So whatever is the identifier for
    you. That'll, again, vary for your data. So you do need to see how that is performing
    over time – the way you will monitor the accuracy, you can even monitor your data.
  sec: 2428
  time: '40:28'
  who: Supreet
- line: We probably covered it, but there is another question from Raquel, which is,
    “If we're using data to train our models and identify our checkpoints and alarm,
    how is the data protected from human bias?” I think we answered that – correct
    me if I'm wrong. We answered that by saying that we should monitor this demographic
    information. So we should take a population sample. Or maybe if we're not predicting
    for people, maybe there are some other indicators that we can monitor. It probably
    varies case by case, but we should have a metric that probably indicates some
    sort of diversity in the sample. Right?
  sec: 2463
  time: '41:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Again, that human touch part comes in. When someone is analyzing those cumulative
    statistics and looking at that data, they will be able to see that if there's
    a pattern, the next time they're monitoring it, they'll easily be able to see
    it. The other thing that's also important is to check the source of your data.
    Sometimes the source that you are doing – I know that in some of the use cases,
    in some of the organizations, they collect all of this feedback from humans.
  sec: 2506
  time: '41:46'
  who: Supreet
- line: Basically, they do surveys and they collect that data. And they do it over
    a larger period of time and then use that data to build the model. Now, with survey
    data, what did your population look like? From that data, only you can start detecting
    the bias – the way you’re even collecting the data can be questionable. So check
    the source as well.
  sec: 2506

- line: Just curious, how did you become interested in this topic? Like was it something
    you studied and then you became fascinated? Or is it something through practice
    that made you realize that this is a super important topic? How did it happen
    for you?
  sec: 2559
  time: '42:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it just happened because I was in two of the most regulated industries
    and everything was on high alarm. You have to take every step in a very thoughtful
    way because it impacts the lives of people and it can lead to lawsuits, easily
    [chuckles] I would say. So that is where it was kind of my observation and my
    reading about how important it is to be cautious and responsible and how companies
    are evolving. And that's why it became a topic of my interest.
  sec: 2571
  time: '42:51'
  who: Supreet
- line: So for areas like finance, insurance, health care, etc. this is especially
    important, right?
  sec: 2608
  time: '43:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, exactly. Actually, anywhere where you were dealing with sensitive
    consumer information, which has been labeled as PII – it kind of becomes important.
    But now I would say that it's fanning out to all the industries because as people
    get more conscious of what they are getting, and people are very brand conscious
    for everything, even for the clothes we buy. We're like, “Okay, how are they treating
    animals? And what are they doing?” And so, people are becoming more brand conscious
    now.
  sec: 2616
  time: '43:36'
  who: Supreet
- header: Trustworthy AI
- line: Speaking again of age and gender, if you think about this, they are not really
    PII in the sense that, if I tell you “This person is a female, who is between
    30 and 40 years of age,” you will not be able to find where this person lives,
    right? In this sense, it's not really personal identifiable information.
  sec: 2647
  time: '44:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's again, subjective. I don't know if you've heard about this – there's
    a tool by Amazon, I think. They created this HR tool to screen their applicants.
    There, all of this information is easily available because on the resume, people
    will write about their date of birth and everything.
  sec: 2680
  time: '44:40'
  who: Supreet
- line: They shouldn't, probably. [chuckles]
  sec: 2700
  time: '45:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [laughs] They observed that for all the physically demanding jobs, the
    algorithm was just selecting males. It was ignoring females. Again, the bias –
    because data was so biased. Historical data was all males, so it assumed. In some
    of such use cases, you require all of those things, because age is an appropriate
    factor there, gender might be an appropriate factor there. So yeah.
  sec: 2702
  time: '45:02'
  who: Supreet
- line: Did you know how Amazon solved this problem? What did they do?
  sec: 2730
  time: '45:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. It was a tool that was developed by them, but then it was being used by
    other CEOs. It’s in the book that I was referring to – Trustworthy AI –where she
    kind of talks about this dilemma of CEOs trying to select candidates for this
    role. How they detected it is because she was like, “Why are you only giving me
    males to interview? Where are the females? For the past five months, you haven't
    got a single female candidate?" So again, the human touch – the conscious – someone
    was able to question the decisions and they were able to see how the model is
    biased. It was kind of like an ATS tracker that they used. But I'm not sure if
    it was… don't quote me on this if it was by Amazon or some other company. [chuckles]
  sec: 2735
  time: '45:35'
  who: Supreet
- line: Okay. I’ve seen that mentioned as well. Something like Fair Learn. You talked
    about this AIF 360. Abishek mentioned another tool – Fair Learn. Do you know what
    this tool is?
  sec: 2783
  time: '46:23'

  sec: 2800

  sec: 2807
  time: '46:47'
  who: Supreet
- header: Reliability vs fairness
- line: I assume it's something similar. I personally haven't used this tool. It’s
    probably something similar to Scikit Learn. At least the name suggests that it's
    probably something for fairness. Since we talked about fairness – I think we spent
    quite a lot of time talking about fairness –how is this related to reliable machine
    learning? Does a reliable model have to always be fair? And the other way around
    – if a model is fair, is it always reliable?
  sec: 2811
  time: '46:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's kind of a very thoughtful question. “Do all of my models need to be
    fair?” Comes down to “What is the use case I’m trying to solve? Am I trying to
    send someone personalized recommendations? Do I want to exclude a population?”
    Excluding a population also has some effects, right? Because you might be excluding
    some of the potential customers that were ready to engage with you, but just because
    your model was not fair enough, you just secluded a population and you secluded
    some potential customers.
  sec: 2844
  time: '47:24'
  who: Supreet
- line: So it's about that. The other thing is, again, it's also about the happiness
    of your users. Right? In the same family, there might be different people indulging
    with your product. One is receiving something the other is not. Obviously, everyone's
    not gonna put a lawsuit against you. But it's unhappy customers.
  sec: 2844
  time: '47:24'
  who: Supreet
- line: Some might. So you don't want to risk that, right? Abishek is writing a lot
    of comments and is probably also into this topic. He wrote “There is a cool paper
    titled ‘What would an Avenger do?’” Do you know this paper?
  sec: 2901

    and see what it is about. There are people saying that this is a nice paper –
    the title was amazing. I hope it's not a Rickroll. [laughs] Recently somebody
    sent me a Rickroll link, and I got Rickrolled. [chuckles]
  sec: 2922
  time: '48:42'
  who: Alexey
- header: Bias indicators
- line: Okay. We have quite a few questions. So maybe we can cover them too. “Do you
    know if there are any synthetic indicators for bias in data similar to RMSE, which
    is an indicator of accuracy for models?” Is there a number that can just tell
    us, “Hey! Your model seems biased. Go check it.”?
  sec: 2956
  time: '49:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, I can tell you a number, but I feel like even if I was working on
    10 use cases, that number will be different for all the 10 use cases. [chuckles]
    It will still depend, because you're obviously not using one dataset to build
    the model. You're probably using 15, especially if you're building a production
    AI model. So I don't think that there's any number like that. Then again, there
    are baselines that you can set, based on your company's data. If it goes beyond
    this baseline, it's an alarm, based on what you observe over time. But I don't
    think you can set up a static number. Again, you might be getting into the same
    situation.
  sec: 2980
  time: '49:40'
  who: Supreet
- header: The future of explainable AI
- line: So then you still need to have this human touch. A person needs to say, “Hey,
    why are you bringing me all the male candidates? Where are the females?” Right?
    So somebody still needs to raise this question and say, “Hey, what's going on?”
    So it's not possible to remove the human touch at all, right? The human always
    has to be in this process.

  sec: 3042
  time: '50:42'
  who: Supreet
- line: But right now. [Supreet laughs approvingly] There is another point that in
    the age of AutoML – when you just get the data you throw it in a black box and
    then it gives back a good model and then you can just go and use it. When it becomes
    so simple to train a model, even for people who are maybe not data scientists,
    how can we still be cautious about this and not completely put a lot of trust
    in the model?
  sec: 3044
  time: '50:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Again, I think even interpretability of all these explainable AI tools – that
    might not be a priority of everyone. It's a priority of some industries. So again,
    what's your company's goal? You might be just fine with developing one of the
    most wonderful and accurate AI algorithms and you just might be happy with that.
    You might not care about interpretability and that's where it comes. This versus
    that. It's an answer that you have to do. But I feel even in AutoML, you might
    give your input data, but you still have some power over the data. You can still
    explore that and see what's there before blindly just inserting it.

- line: DataBuzz . As I said, I am from a non-computer science background and I have
    had some unique challenges to get into this field – being from a non coding background,
    being able to justify that I can be a data scientist, and exploring other realms
    of data science. For people it might be, “Oh, there's a data scientist.” No –
    “There's a data strategist. There's an AI consultant. There's an MLOps engineer.”
    There are so many things you can do with your unique skill set, especially if
    you are building from a business and a business plus a science field, there is
    something unique that you have to offer.

    so much to learn. I am an avid reader, so whenever I see something cool, I try
    to post it on my page so that my community can benefit. Any cool resource that
    will help you upskill is posted on my LinkedIn page. So you can follow that and
    I also provide one-on-one consultations for free and I connect you with my large
    network of people that I have from the past five years. They can help you to pivot
    where you would like to pivot.

  sec: 3211
  time: '53:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. I was doing it unofficially for a lot of years. But now, I started this
    community at the start of this year. Because I felt “Okay, now I can officially
    do this.” [chuckles]

- header: The diversity of data science roles
- line: You said that it's not just data scientists – there are so many data roles.
    Quite often, I also get requests like, “Okay, I'm doing X. How can I become a
    data scientist?” And this X usually varies from… I don't know – baristas to software
    engineers. So first, what you need to explain to people is that it's not just
    data science. My question is – what is out there in addition to data science?
    You mentioned a few rolls, but what are the typical roles that people can look
    at?
  sec: 3230
  time: '53:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think first of all, the question to ask is “What is my skill set and what
    do I want to do with it?” Do you actually want to be building models? Some people
    are learning to research so these people are becoming machine learning engineers,
    or they're called research scientists or applied scientists, in the tech world.
    These are people who actually research the algorithms. Some people are interested
    in the aftermath of productionizing the model – the MLOps engineer. Those might
    be software developers who now want to pivot into the ML field – or DevOps engineers
    who want to pivot.
  sec: 3269
  time: '54:29'
  who: Supreet
- line: Now the other one is the people who want to relate the business to the AI.
    These are the AI consultants, who actually search all of the AI use cases and
    then pitch clients. Here, you typically have a consulting relationship with your
    customers. And then you have these data analysts – you have business analysts.
    Even those are a kind of data scientist, because now you're doing all the project
    management and you're doing the analytics and reporting for your data science
    results. And even before the data science results. Then you have data strategists
    [chuckles] who are strategizing on what data you need. All of these.
  sec: 3269
  time: '54:29'
  who: Supreet
- line: For example, a project manager or somebody who works as a project manager
    in some traditional industry, like manufacturing or anything. How can they select
    what works for them? It doesn't have to be a project manager, but usually, every
    person has unique skills. How do you understand this, if all you know is that
    “data scientist is like the sexiest job” and you might not know how about others?
  sec: 3341
  time: '55:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, that's a tough question. Even when I was trying to decide my career,
    I think I have spoken to like 100+ people. I did coffee chats with people from
    different industries, different domains, and tried to explore “What do they actually
    do?” You cannot just read the job description and know, “This is where I fit.”
    I feel like all these networking events, conferences, coffee chats, and engaging
    in such communities will probably lead you where you want to go.

- header: Ethics in data science
- line: From all these roles, does everyone need to know and care about responsible
    AI and explainable AI?
  sec: 3404
  time: '56:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't think so. [laughs] I feel like all of these bring something unique
    to the table. And again, if your role does care about you, you do need to add
    that touch. But it will, again, depend on the organization. You might be in a
    startup who might say, “Eh, no. Just care about the profit. Just bring me the
    most profitable AI algorithm.” It depends. [cross-talk]
  sec: 3413
  time: '56:53'
  who: Supreet
- line: But then I, as a data scientist, probably have some moral duty to tell the
    CTO, “Hey, wait a minute. This is not how it's done. You should think about our
    reputation.”
  sec: 3436
  time: '57:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: It also depends on where you are in the stage of your career. Are you an influencer?
    Are you a decision maker in the decision making process? Or are you just the person
    who executes whatever is told to you? If someone's actually starting in the data
    science domain, it might be hard for them to convince people what needs to be
    done. Once you have established yourself, then it is your moral responsibility,
    if you’ve been in the industry for three or four years, to do everything responsibly.
  sec: 3451
  time: '57:31'
  who: Supreet
- line: At least everyone who gets into the data world should perhaps study ethics
    or something like this.
  sec: 3479
  time: '57:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but this is such a budding field that so many people don't… even though
    I don't build explainable AI models, but I feel like, as an ethical person, it's
    my responsibility to understand what I'm doing and how I'm doing it.
  sec: 3487
  time: '58:07'
  who: Supreet
- line: Actually, at work, if I want to have access to data – I, as a data scientist,
    have to have access to data – I need to go through special training. This training
    tells me what is good and what is not. I think more and more companies are actually
    implementing this. Of course, I can use my common sense. When there are quizzes
    and when I need to answer these quizzes, most of the time I just use my common
    sense. And more often than not, the answer is correct. But it's still a good idea
    to tell people, “You know what? This is how it's possible to do wrong with data.”
    All the data people should probably do this sort of thing.
  sec: 3505
  time: '58:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, definitely.  I think even when you join a firm, you go through some
    tricky things, like “What do you do in case of emergency?” And I feel like this
    is one of the things – when you have such data, how do you deal with this and
    become a responsible individual?

    up, is there anything you want to mention that maybe you forgot?
  sec: 3567

  who: Alexey
- line: I just want to thank everyone for joining and for being so interactive. If
    there was any question that was not unheard, or if there's something that you
    would personally like to discuss – I'm very active on LinkedIn. Do connect with
    me there. You can even look into the DataBuzz page and all the views and everything
    that I spoke about today was my opinion and had nothing to do with Morgan Stanley.
    [chuckles] Disclaimer.

  who: Supreet
- line: That was an important part to mention, right? [chuckles] Yeah, everyone for
    joining us too – for being active, for asking all these questions. There was a
    very lovely and lively discussion in the live chat. So thanks for doing that.
    And I wish everyone a great weekend.
