transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about the role of a chief data officer. We have a special
    guest today, Marco. Marco is the chief data officer at OLX Group, which is the
    place where I work as well. So we are colleagues. Before OLX, Marco worked at
    Spotify, Twitter, Facebook. I probably missed a couple of companies. You also
    have a PhD, right? Welcome, Marco!

- header: "Marco\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go into our main topic of the role of a chief data officer, let's
    start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 132
  time: '2:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I'll start all the way back. I'm Portuguese, I grew up in Portugal, I got\
    \ a degree in computer science. Then I realised that I liked people more than\
    \ I liked computers. I hope I don't offend anyone with this. This made me move\
    \ more into trying to understand people and how they use computers. I still love\
    \ technology, more so than just spending all my time with technology. Because\
    \ of that, I ended up getting a master's in Information Systems, which is a way\
    \ of getting information about how people are interacting with systems \u2014\
    \ this is now called \"Data Science\". This was a long time ago. Then ended up\
    \ getting a PhD in related topics, moving towards a qualitative understanding\
    \ of users, like user research. That's my academic background. I had a lot of\
    \ fun, I worked on quite a few different areas during my studies."
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Marco
- line: "I ended up moving to the US where I joined Yahoo. I worked as a research\
    \ scientist that included quite a bit of data science: pulling data and making\
    \ sense of it, understanding opportunities to build innovation. To be totally\
    \ transparent, it was quite detached from the product development happening in\
    \ the company \u2014 looking further ahead, like 5-10 years out. I worked on things\
    \ like augmented reality on mobile devices. This was over 10 years ago before\
    \ Pokemon Go. Also, I worked on live video production before periscope existed,\
    \ and a bunch of other fun projects. The goal was to publish patents, which is\
    \ fine, but not a lot of impact."
  sec: 203
  time: '3:23'
  who: Marco
- line: I ended up moving to Facebook. At the time it had less than 1 billion users.
    I worked on trying to understand how can we expand on the products that we have
    and how can we build more value for our users. I was leveraging both qualitative
    and quantitative data and figuring out how can we solve user problems in the best
    possible way through technology, software, and design. I had a lot of fun and
    stayed there for a couple of years.
  sec: 249
  time: '4:09'
  who: Marco
- line: Then I moved to Twitter to continue doing the same thing, but scaling up my
    impact through management and building teams. I spent a few years at Twitter.
    All of this was in the Bay Area. In Twitter, I worked on the launch of a ranked
    timeline that leveraged ML to organise and rank tweets based on someone's interests
    versus that typical reverse chronology. This was a pretty controversial move by
    Twitter but ended up working really well. It's still maintained.
  sec: 280
  time: '4:40'
  who: Marco
- line: Then I moved to Spotify in New York. There I led a bunch of data science teams,
    marketing insights, started to build marketing analytics, user research, growth
    strategy, and a few other disciplines. My goal was always to use data to make
    smart and informed decisions that are going to benefit our users.
  sec: 317
  time: '5:17'
  who: Marco
- line: Nine or so months ago, I moved back from the US to Europe, and I joined OLX
    Group, where I have the role of chief data officer. It's been a fun journey so
    far.
  sec: 341
  time: '5:41'
  who: Marco
- line: Thanks! That's quite a journey. I haven't met many people who say that they
    like people more than computers. Usually, it's the opposite.
  sec: 354
  time: '5:54'
  who: Alexey
- header: Role of CDO
- line: Can you tell us what do you do at OLX as a chief data officer?
  sec: 368
  time: '6:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'The chief data officer is a fairly new role, not just within OLX, but across
    industries. It''s still being defined as we go. In my case, I''m responsible for
    defining our broad data strategy. That includes quite a few pillars: all the way
    from data infrastructure and data governance to "What kind of data do we need
    for us to continue expanding on our business?", and "What''s the value that we
    bring to our users?", "How do we make sense of that data?" and "How do we make
    it accessible across the different organisations that are part of our group?",
    "How do we leverage that data to make better products through artificial intelligence
    and machine learning?", working with different business lines, business units,
    and teams that we have across the group. I want to make sure that we''re prepared
    for the future, and we''re delivering the best possible value for our users and
    anticipating needs that they might have.'
  sec: 375
  time: '6:15'
  who: Marco
- line: "That's quite a lot of things. I was also wondering what a CDO does, and I\
    \ read an article before our char. It was about the role of CDO. Here is the summary.\
    \ There are four main responsibilities. The first one is governance, which is\
    \ monitoring and governing enterprise data. I think you mentioned governments\
    \ as well. Then, operations \u2014 enabling data usability and availability. The\
    \ third thing was innovation \u2014 driving cost reduction in generating revenue.\
    \ The final one was analysis \u2014 supporting analytics and reporting. Is it\
    \ an accurate description of the role? Or something is missing?"
  sec: 437
  time: '7:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It covers part of it. I think that's a more traditional, slightly outdated\
    \ view on the chief data officer role. As we move forward, the integration with\
    \ innovation, product development, business strategy becomes more noticeable \u2014\
    \ that's such a crucial part of any business. It indicates how your business is\
    \ performing, which ties it to analytics. But it also powers a lot of product\
    \ development and product work. Having the right data to enable ML applications\
    \ to solve different problems touches on the access and usability of that data,\
    \ touches on the collection, safety, and use of that data. It also touches on\
    \ understanding the problems that you're trying to solve \u2014 not just from\
    \ an efficiency perspective of collecting, storing that data, making it accessible\
    \ in an efficient way and innovating, but also understanding our user base \u2014\
    \ our customers, both external and internal, so that we can use this data to solve\
    \ their problems."
  sec: 501
  time: '8:21'
  who: Marco
- line: 'That''s the direction that we''re moving towards: having people in a position
    of being able to drive the data, infrastructure, and organisations, but also understanding
    the real business problems that can be solved through data. Often I see a bit
    of a disconnect between business leaders and the more technical side of the organisation.
    They want something to happen, they have clear problems that they need to solve,
    but the technical side is usually focused on technical things instead of using
    technology to solve business problems.'
  sec: 572
  time: '9:32'
  who: Marco
- line: 'One point is not clearly articulated in this list: it''s the responsibility
    to look forward and design for the future and for data. Data is going to continue
    powering innovation. The more data you have, the more you''ll be able to do it.
    That could be as simple as asking a user question during the signup flow or collecting
    some contextual information such as location when an interaction happens. A lot
    of companies are doing that, but often they think of data as a consequence of
    the products, not a driver of the future products that they can have. That''s
    part of the responsibility of the Chief Data officers to think, "Three years from
    now, what data will enable us to do something that we don''t do yet?", and "How
    can we get that data in an ethical, responsible and safe way?".'
  sec: 619
  time: '10:19'
  who: Marco
- header: Keeping track of many things
- line: So you need to think about all these things? I don't know how many things
    you mentioned, five or six? How is it even possible for a single person to keep
    track of all that? I imagine that you don't just go there and then analyze data,
    you also don't go there and develop infrastructure. You delegate the work. But
    how do you keep track of all that? How do you know which things need to happen
    and which don't?
  sec: 700
  time: '11:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Well, they're all, to some extent, related. The production of data, the collection\
    \ of data, the access to that data, the utilisation, modelling that data so it\
    \ can be used in different contexts, thinking about those contexts. Ultimately,\
    \ it comes down to working with different people. No single person can have the\
    \ answers for all the questions that have to do with data, and all the applications\
    \ of that data in whatever business context. Building the right teams, having\
    \ the right teams, having the right people that know much better than me what\
    \ to do. I can offer the context, the resources, or the support for them to drive\
    \ aspects of the vision that is created jointly. That's the key to success in\
    \ the organisation where we have a complex set of goals that interact with each\
    \ other \u2014 having the right people that share that vision, can communicate\
    \ that vision, and work together to deliver it."
  sec: 731
  time: '12:11'
  who: Marco
- line: 'For each of these pillars, or responsibilities, you have a person who leads
    it. For operations, it could be a director of data engineering. Then your role
    is to keep everything in mind at the same time and make sure that they are not
    disconnected: everyone has the same context and understands why we''re doing certain
    things. Is it an accurate summary?'
  sec: 791
  time: '13:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, I think so. To some extent, the organisational design varies depending\
    \ on many things. Companies are more and more distributed. Teams sometimes should\
    \ be together, sometimes separate. There are various types of organisations. But\
    \ absolutely, my role is to enable, extract the information and division from\
    \ those different teams and try to articulate it into a single vision, a single\
    \ strategy that makes sense for the business and also continuously delivers value\
    \ to our users \u2014 which is the biggest driver of the business."
  sec: 827
  time: '13:47'
  who: Marco
- header: Becoming a CDO
- line: 'Thanks! We already have a question: "What skills are necessary to go from
    head of data science or analytics to CDO?" This is something I also wanted to
    ask you. At some point, you were probably also a head of something, and then you
    eventually become a CDO. I''m curious what the journey looked like for you. What
    did you do to become a CDO?'
  sec: 864
  time: '14:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'It''s going to take quite a while to map exactly the things that led this
    path. The key differences are not in terms of skill set but in terms of where
    you spend your time as you progress in your career and take a more strategic role.
    Becoming more strategic is the requirement for moving in the direction of a CDO.
    That means prioritising aggressively to focus on the big picture: the vision,
    the distance, objectives that you have, versus the technical operations and how
    to execute that. The key in any leadership role is the ability to empower and
    enable people to do the best, hire people that can do that much better than you,
    being able to scale yourself, and not get too attached to the solutions and the
    execution of that vision. In the end, you''re going to depend entirely on people
    that can do that with you. My journey has always revolved around surrounding myself
    with people that can do amazing things, working more as a facilitator and enabler
    of their fantastic work.'
  sec: 894
  time: '14:54'
  who: Marco
- line: I don't want to mischaracterize the requirements of this type of role. That's
    not specific to CDO, it could also be CTO, CPO, etc. Having a good understanding
    of the craft and some background helps you guide people who are more technical
    than you. Then you bring them along the journey with you. Having constructive
    conversations around that is pretty hard to do if you don't have any domain knowledge.
    If you don't understand the craft, if you don't understand the technology, it's
    hard for you to drive (but not impossible) a group of complex organisations, and
    be passionate about what you do as well. It's achievable by anyone as long as
    you focus on delivering the best possible impact for your business, using the
    tools that you have in your hand.
  sec: 988
  time: '16:28'
  who: Marco
- header: Strategy vs tactics
- line: 'So, to summarise: you need to become more strategic, always keep the big
    picture in your mind, have this vision. I''m curious, when people say "you need
    to be more strategic", what do they mean? Then we also talk about strategy vs
    tactics. Tactics is something that you do immediately, right? And strategy is
    something that you plan long-term?'
  sec: 1057
  time: '17:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Strategy is your broad plan to get from where you are to where you want to
    be, and it's more aligned with where you want to be. The tactics or the execution
    are the smaller steps that you take along that journey.
  sec: 1101
  time: '18:21'
  who: Marco
- line: So strategy could be setting up some KPIs or some goals, like "This is what
    we want to do in three-five years", right? Then you tell about this vision to
    others, you convince them that this is the right direction to go, you try to explain
    it, and then it's up to others to actually decide how to go there and what needs
    to happen to actually be there in three years? So, tactics is the sequence of
    steps we need to do to achieve our goal in 3 years, right?
  sec: 1122
  time: '18:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that's a good example. I would also think if we have the right people
    to execute those tasks? Am I enabling those people, giving them the right resources,
    setting them up for success? I also need to ensure that we have the right people
    to build some of those strategy blocks. You can break down a strategy into smaller
    pieces of that strategy, that then are executed using some tactics.
  sec: 1158
  time: '19:18'
  who: Marco
- line: 'The line is blurry between the two. But it''s exactly the case: looking ahead,
    setting some ambitious goals, and then deciding how to break this down to make
    it happen, and aslo working with the right people to share that workload and finding
    people that can execute it better than you can.'
  sec: 1190
  time: '19:50'
  who: Marco
- header: VP of Data vs CDO
- line: There is this role called "VP of Data". What's the difference between VP of
    Data and CDO? And, in general, we have CTO and VP of engineering, we have CPO
    (Chief Product Officer) and VP of product, and we have CDO and VP of data. And
    to me, CDO and VP of data look pretty similar. They're quite high in the corporate
    hierarchy, both are quite strategic. They both need to think about "where we want
    to be in three years". So what is the difference between these two roles?
  sec: 1217
  time: '20:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: The difference depends on your organisation and the size of your organisation.
    It ultimately boils down to the scope. I'd say a CDO is a level above in terms
    of the strategy influence. You're working closely with the CPO, the CTO, the CFO,
    and the CEO. You're thinking about all the angles of how data is beneficial for
    your business and how it's used to drive that business. A VP is typically responsible
    for a piece of that. That can be attached to a business client, a domain, or one
    of those pillars that I mentioned. They could be more focused on the governance
    and collection of data and infrastructure, could be more focused on the data science
    portion or the analytics portion. Whereas CDO has to have the horizontal perspective
    and the business component because they're part of the executive team.
  sec: 1264
  time: '21:04'
  who: Marco
- line: "I'm trying to think of an example. The goal could be \"make X amount of money\"\
    , or \"X amount of market share\" or something like this. This would be a strategic\
    \ goal. This is where we want to be in three years. Then you think \"We have this\
    \ goal. How do we set our strategy to be there?\". Then you look at all these\
    \ pillars, and try to understand what needs to happen \u2014 from the data point\
    \ of view \u2014 to actually get that market share, right?"
  sec: 1349
  time: '22:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 1389
  time: '23:09'
  who: Marco
- line: So you decompose the strategy into multiple things, and the VP of data will
    take one of the pieces?
  sec: 1393
  time: '23:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, to some extent. On the CDO level, the expectation is not just say, "Here's
    what we need to do from the data angle to achieve that goal". It's also "here
    are some goals that will drive the business in this way". Not just think of data
    as a supporting function to drive the business, but as a driver of the business
    itself. "If we do these five things from a data angle, the business will grow
    by this much." This proactive component is likely to be more present in the responsibilities
    of CDO. Whereas the VP is typically attached to a specific component of that strategy.
  sec: 1402
  time: '23:22'
  who: Marco
- line: But it depends greatly on the organization. If it's an organisation with 200
    people and with a very clear domain or a clear problem to solve, then maybe the
    role of a CDO in that context is smaller than the role of a VP. The VP has a bigger
    context where they own a specific angle of the strategy. So it depends, but I'd
    say, the distinguishing factor is looking across multiple points.
  sec: 1414
  time: '23:34'
  who: Marco
- header: How many VPs of Data could be there?
- line: Do CDOs usually have multiple VPs reporting to them or just one VP of Data?
  sec: 1495
  time: '24:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends greatly on the organisation. In many cases, they can have several,
    depending on how they structure the organisations. Let's use a practical example
    that is not necessarily attached to any of the companies that I've worked at.
    You could have a company that is split into producers and consumers of some sort
    of content. Then you can have someone who's responsible for the data strategy
    for producers, and someone else is the VP of data for the consumers. Whereas the
    CDO has to work with both those people. And then there might be other components
    as well. It's not very common to have just one person in the reporting line. It
    also depends on the career ladder of the organisation. Some organisations have
    a long and steep career ladder, where you have senior manager, directors, senior
    directors, VP, Senior VP. Some have a more flat hierarchy where they'll have manager,
    then director, and then VP.
  sec: 1503
  time: '25:03'
  who: Marco
- header: Splitting the work between VP and CDO
- line: 'A few companies back at work as a company where we had a CTO, and the CTO
    had one VP of engineering reporting to him. That situation seemed pretty strange
    to me. It looked like the VP is doing all the work. And the CTO actually just
    manages one person. I was always curious how are we actually split the responsibilities
    between each other. If you look just from this organisational structure: CDO ->
    VP of data -> a bunch of people reporting to him or to her.'
  sec: 1571
  time: '26:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you have to spend a lot of time thinking about "What kinds of data will
    we need in the future?", "How do we tie and enable the business to move in this
    direction?", "How do you comply with governance models from a specific region
    of the world?", etc. And, at the same time, you also need to execute against building
    this tool, building this framework, building this infrastructure, then the division
    of work can be fairly simple. There's still a ton of work to do, that is covered
    by the CDO. But that's dependent on the size of the organisation and how the roles
    are defined. This applies not just to data. It applies to CPO and VP of product,
    to technology as well as other functions. So it depends on how much is there to
    do and how many people do we need to do it successfully and continue building
    upon that.
  sec: 1621
  time: '27:01'
  who: Marco
- header: Difference between CTO, CPO, and CDO
- line: "Do you know what's the main difference between CTO, CPO, and CDO? When I\
    \ look at the top management \u2014 it's all about meetings, setting strategy,\
    \ planning for budgets. These responsibilities look pretty similar. So what's\
    \ the core difference between all these roles?"
  sec: 1682
  time: '28:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It depends on the type of company and the type of product. In some cases,\
    \ the product is more technology-related \u2014 if you're building a framework\
    \ or a platform that other companies are going to use, versus building something\
    \ for usual users. It varies quite a bit. Typically a CPO is more focused on determining\
    \ the product vision. What is the product supposed to do? CPO then works with\
    \ CTO, who is focused on \"how do we build that\" and \"how we use technology\
    \ to make that vision come to life\". The CDO is more concerned with \"what data\
    \ do we have that enables us to build that, to inform the direction that we're\
    \ going in, and to continue pushing that vision forward\". That could be a high-level\
    \ theoretical division of responsibilities. But it depends a lot. For some companies,\
    \ their product is data. Their CEO can likely fulfil both roles. I've seen places\
    \ where all those roles are combined. And I've seen places where they're clearly\
    \ differentiated because that's the nature of the product and their technology\
    \ stack as well as the data they produce or consume."
  sec: 1710
  time: '28:30'
  who: Marco
- line: To make it a bit concrete. We talked about this example of "get X market share",
    or "that amount of revenue". Probably this is a goal that the CEO would set together
    with the entire team. Then it would be up to the CPO, CTO, CDO to actually decide
    how to decompose this goal and see what kind of data initiatives could happen,
    right? Like, "we need to make this, this and this data available to make these
    things possible. Everyone thinks "what we can do from the engineering point of
    view?", "what we can do from the product point of view?", "what we can do from
    the data point of view?", right? Then it cascades down to a VP of data, who would
    need to think about a particular chunk of the data strategy, up to engineering
    managers, and so on.
  sec: 1792
  time: '29:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, VP of data \u2014 or whatever the titles are in that organisation.\
    \ I would again add that the responsibilities of those three C-level types of\
    \ roles are beyond just executing or breaking down the strategy from the CEO into\
    \ the specific functions that they represent. It's also to provide input and offer\
    \ a vision of the future that the CEO can put together and help ensure that he\
    \ enables the other C-level executives to deliver that. It's more of a proactive\
    \ role, where you're not just delivering against something that is asked of you,\
    \ you're offering opportunities to the person that can help you make those decisions\
    \ or make those decisions for them."
  sec: 1860
  time: '31:00'
  who: Marco
- header: Breaking down the goals and working backwards from them
- line: You mentioned at some point something like "if we do these five things, then
    we will achieve this goal". I'm wondering, how do you come up with these things?
    How do you know if we need to invest in a data platform? Or how do you know if
    we need to enable our analysts to process data better? Or how do you know if we
    need a better machine learning platform? How do you know where the company should
    go to achieve this goal in three years?
  sec: 1910
  time: '31:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'That''s a broad question. There are many ways of approaching it. I approach
    that by first aligning on the goals and then working back from those goals. I
    try to understand what are the blockers for us to achieve that. Then, break those
    blockers down by the magnitude and impact of that blocker and optimise for things
    that are going to help us get there faster. What are the enablers that are going
    to help you drive that vision forward? The vision itself is also organised around
    the impact that it brings: the value for users and the value for the business.
    What are the biggest bets that you can take to help your company, colleagues,
    and users to have a better experience, to get more value out of the product, and
    be able to achieve their goals faster?'
  sec: 1946
  time: '32:26'
  who: Marco

    a hypothesis that this will be a good solution for your problem. Have a concrete
    plan on how to prove that hypothesis. What is the data, or information, or evidence,
    or context, or input that leads you to believe that it''s a strong hypothesis?
    It should be a hypothesis that you can validate, measure, and provide this proof.'

- line: So, the best way to approach it is to break down the problem and then demonstrating,
    articulating in a clear way, why you want to do it. But always be open to being
    disproven, to getting feedback. I like to surround myself with people that know
    about certain problems much more than I do. They're likely to come up with better
    solutions. So if someone disagrees with something, I always try to understand
    why. Maybe together we can come up with a better solution. Or maybe I can explain
    my solution or perspective better. And that's feedback in itself as well.

- line: I don't know how this is always applicable. But in some situations, you also
    have to say, "It has to be this way because of constraints that we cannot discuss"
    or something like that. And there's not a lot of persuasion other than "We have
    to make a decision. This decision". But often, it's a factor of having that discussion,
    together aligning on whether that's the right solution or not. In some cases,
    you have constraints that force you to make decisions very quickly. You have to
    do those. And be ready to fail, but also be ready to learn from it. And take responsibility
    and accountability if it doesn't go well.
