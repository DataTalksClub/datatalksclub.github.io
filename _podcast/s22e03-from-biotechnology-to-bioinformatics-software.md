    link in the live chat. Click on that link, ask your questions, and we will cover
    them during the interview.
  sec: 34
  time: 0:34
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s the usual introduction. I have the questions on the left side and Zoom
    on the right side, so I’m ready to start. Sebastian, are you ready?
  sec: 53
  time: 0:53
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 68
  time: '1:08'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Hi everyone. This week we are joined by Sebastian, a bioinformatics software
    engineer whose career bridges biotechnology and programming. Sebastian began in
    biotechnology engineering but realized research wasn’t his path. Through a minor
    in software engineering and a master’s degree combining both fields, he transitioned
    into bioinformatics software engineering.
  sec: 69
  time: '1:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I will ask you more about these things, and I’m really happy to have you here
    on this podcast.
  sec: 96
  time: '1:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you very much.
  sec: 102
  time: '1:42'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Let’s start with the first question. I always ask guests to tell us more about
    their career journey so far. I outlined it briefly, but I don’t know much about
    biotechnology or bioinformatics, except maybe one course I took on Coursera twelve
    years ago. So tell us about your career journey so far.
  sec: 105
  time: '1:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I did my bachelor’s here in Ecuador. I studied biotechnology engineering,
    which is the application of living organisms in different areas. You can apply
    it to develop new potential drugs or in agriculture. All the applications are
    based on living organisms. Then, while I was doing my bachelor’s, I realized that
    I didn’t enjoy biology and wet lab work that much.
  sec: 127
  time: '2:07'
  who: Sebastian
- line: I started to take some electives on programming and math, and I liked that
    approach more. I did a minor in software engineering, and in my master’s, I combined
    both fields in bioinformatics. During the last year, I have been working more
    on software development for bioinformatics.
  sec: 167
  time: '2:47'
  who: Sebastian
- line: You said you just finished your project in Denmark and moved to Ecuador to
    spend the winter there. Amazing idea. I live in Berlin, so I can imagine what
    it’s like now in Denmark. I think it’s even worse than in Berlin since it’s closer
    to the sea. Good idea spending time in Ecuador.
  sec: 197
  time: '3:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: What exactly was your project about? Was it pure software engineering or bioinformatics?
    What do you actually do now?
  sec: 221
  time: '3:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: I did my master’s in the Netherlands in bioinformatics. My master’s thesis
    was at the Technical University of Denmark. During my thesis, I worked on a project
    called MCW2 Graph. It’s a knowledge graph to investigate the wastewater treatment
    microbiome. A microbiome is all the microorganisms that live in a specific environment.
  sec: 233
  time: '3:53'
  who: Sebastian
- line: We collected samples from wastewater treatment plants and sequenced the DNA
    or proteins inside these environments. After processing this data, you can see
    the presence and abundance of microorganisms in these samples. We took studies
    from different regions and combined the data. Then we inferred microbial association
    networks based on abundance patterns. If two microorganisms co-occur in similar
    abundance, we infer they might be interacting.
  sec: 260
  time: '4:20'
  who: Sebastian
- line: We created these networks and built a knowledge graph on top of them with
    additional metadata. That was my first project there, and then I worked on others.
  sec: 317
  time: '5:17'
  who: Sebastian
- header: From Wet Lab to Computational Biology
- line: I’m taking notes so I can ask you later about these things. I know nothing
    about biotechnology. When COVID happened and companies started developing vaccines,
    was biotechnology involved there? How exactly does it work?
  sec: 362
  time: '6:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. In biotechnology, you do experiments in the lab to test different vaccines
    and how compounds can combat bacteria or viruses. That is biotechnology. You design
    components that are more efficient in combating viruses and bacteria. Bioinformatics
    helps reduce the number of experiments needed in the lab.
  sec: 387
  time: '6:27'
  who: Sebastian
- line: You can run simulations or analyze the data to propose potential candidates
    that lab researchers can test. This reduces time and helps identify better options
    for experimentation.
  sec: 428
  time: '7:08'
  who: Sebastian
- line: I see. I think you have a slight problem with sound. Are you using your headphone
    microphone?
  sec: 448
  time: '7:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 454
  time: '7:34'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Can you try now? I cannot hear you. Sorry everyone, the sound is breaking
    a little.
  sec: 463
  time: '7:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Now I switched to my laptop.
  sec: 478
  time: '7:58'
  who: Sebastian
- line: I think it’s better. The sound was breaking every few seconds, probably a
    Bluetooth issue. Let’s try now. You were saying that this is what biotechnology
    professionals do, especially when working with viruses and bacteria.
  sec: 484
  time: '8:04'
  who: Alexey
- header: Wet Lab vs Dry Lab Explained
- line: In the lab, they run experiments to see what helps combat these microorganisms.
    That’s what biotechnologists do, right? They work in companies like Pfizer or
    other pharmaceutical firms, running experiments. Why is it called a wet lab? Is
    it literally wet there?
  sec: 503
  time: '8:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it’s to distinguish it from a dry lab, which is computational. In the
    wet lab, you physically do experiments and get your hands wet, so to speak.
  sec: 540
  time: '9:00'
  who: Sebastian
- line: So dry lab means you sit in front of a computer, and wet lab means you do
    experiments. When I imagine someone developing a vaccine, I picture them in white
    coats, wearing glasses, and holding test tubes.
  sec: 564
  time: '9:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Test tubes, exactly.
  sec: 584
  time: '9:44'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Yes, doing these things with charts behind them. You didn’t enjoy that part,
    right, working in the lab?
  sec: 587
  time: '9:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, not really. I didn’t like it that much. The biological courses in my bachelor’s
    were too theoretical. They required a lot of memorization, which I didn’t enjoy.
  sec: 597
  time: '9:57'
  who: Sebastian
- line: In the middle of my bachelor’s, I realized I didn’t like it much and decided
    to try something else. I took programming and math courses and realized I liked
    that approach better. In my first programming course, the first class was theoretical,
    but the rest were hands-on exercises. I liked that much more.
  sec: 619
  time: '10:19'
  who: Sebastian
- line: And in the Netherlands, where did you study? Which university?
  sec: 646
  time: '10:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: At Maastricht University.
  sec: 653
  time: '10:53'
  who: Sebastian
- line: I don’t know that one.
  sec: 659
  time: '10:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s near the border with Belgium and Germany, next to Aachen.
  sec: 661
  time: '11:01'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Okay, I didn’t know that existed. So you studied there, and as part of your
    studies, you went to Denmark to work on projects?
  sec: 666
  time: '11:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 679
  time: '11:19'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Okay, and we talked about biotechnology engineering. These are the people
    who develop drugs and vaccines, right? So that’s biotechnology. What is bioinformatics?
    How is it different?
  sec: 681
  time: '11:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Bioinformatics is data science applied to biology. It’s using data science
    techniques to analyze biological data. We take information generated in the lab
    and perform typical data science processes like exploration, analysis, and modeling
    to interpret results and make predictions.
  sec: 705
  time: '11:45'
  who: Sebastian
- line: So basically, you do data science too, but biotechnology is an older field,
    while data science is about fifteen years old.
  sec: 744
  time: '12:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that’s true.
  sec: 750
  time: '12:30'
  who: Sebastian
- header: Bioinformatics as Data Science for Biology
- line: Okay. What kind of data do you have? I mentioned that I took a course on bioinformatics
    years ago. I think we used R, and the data consisted of four different letters.
    What are these letters?
  sec: 755
  time: '12:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'These are nucleotides. Genomic data, like DNA, is made up of chemical compounds
    called nucleotides: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. These four letters
    form the DNA sequence that carries genetic information to make proteins responsible
    for biological functions.'
  sec: 779
  time: '12:59'
  who: Sebastian
- line: I remember the data looked like long strings of text with those four letters.
    You mentioned sequencing DNA and proteins. What does sequencing mean? Aren’t they
    already in a sequence?
  sec: 829
  time: '13:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sequencing means reading and decoding the DNA from a sample. The sample could
    be environmental or biological, like blood or saliva.
  sec: 856
  time: '14:16'
  who: Sebastian
- line: A few years ago, I used a service called MyHeritage to learn where my ancestors
    came from. They sent a small swab kit to collect saliva, which I sent back. That
    was the sample, right?
  sec: 863
  time: '14:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 905
  time: '15:05'
  who: Sebastian
- line: After a few weeks, they sent results showing I’m mostly from the Baltic countries,
    partly Western European, and a mix of others. That’s one of the applications of
    bioinformatics, right?
  sec: 910
  time: '15:10'
  who: Alexey
- header: How DNA Sequencing Works
- line: Yes. They take your sample and sequence it using machines called sequencers.
    The DNA is extracted, broken into small pieces, and decoded to determine the order
    of nucleotides.
  sec: 930
  time: '15:30'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Then they assemble everything to reconstruct your whole genome. From that,
    they compare it to databases linking specific sequences to genes, proteins, or
    populations. Biomarkers in your DNA indicate ancestry or health traits.
  sec: 985
  time: '16:25'
  who: Sebastian
- line: I think one part of my DNA showed I was one percent Irish or Welsh. They must
    have matched a DNA segment to Irish populations in their database.
  sec: 1036
  time: '17:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. They compare your data to a reference genome.
  sec: 1050
  time: '17:30'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Interesting. I assume you didn’t work on ancestry projects but on something
    else. Now that I understand more about biotechnology and bioinformatics, could
    you explain again what you did with the microbiome project?
  sec: 1076
  time: '17:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. That was my master’s thesis project. We worked with metagenomics, which
    studies DNA from environmental samples instead of individual organisms.
  sec: 1096
  time: '18:16'
  who: Sebastian
- line: For example, we could take a sample from a lake or soil to see what microorganisms
    live there. We decode all the DNA and reconstruct the genomes of all microorganisms
    in the sample. This is more complex than a single blood sample since it contains
    many organisms.
  sec: 1123
  time: '18:43'
  who: Sebastian
- header: MCW2 Graph and Wastewater Microbiomes
- line: So the goal is to understand what kind of organisms are in the sample, right?
  sec: 1169
  time: '19:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. In our case, we focused on wastewater treatment plants. We analyzed data
    from different locations because there were many available samples.
  sec: 1181
  time: '19:41'
  who: Sebastian
- line: We downloaded abundance tables, where rows represent microorganisms and columns
    represent samples, with counts showing how often each organism appears. We combined
    datasets from multiple studies and categorized them by biome. Then we inferred
    microbial association networks using correlations between microorganisms’ abundance
    patterns. If they often appear together, we assume some form of interaction.
  sec: 1210
  time: '20:10'
  who: Sebastian
- line: And what does co-abundance patterns mean? So this when you have this sample,
    right, and you understand that you have like I don't know three samples of three
    counts from organism A, five counts from organism B, and then there is in some
    other sample you have kind of similar thing, right? And then by analyzing all
    this abundance tables as you call them, right, you can see that these organisms
    tend to coexist, right? So you see them together often in the same environments,
    right?
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Mhm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's basically it. And yeah, we kind of create
    these links between these microorganisms if they are co-abundant.
  sec: 1312
  time: '21:52'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Interesting. For me, I never worked with this kind of data, but what I did
    is a bit of NLP. In NLP, you have this co-occurrence tables. When you have some
    context and you see that certain words appear together, then you can say that
    they are co-occurring.
  sec: 1325
  time: '22:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: There is a special term for that I don't remember, like New York, right? New
    York is always like that. If you see New York, it's very likely that they co-occur.
    Or names of movies, or some expressions, right? If you see one word, another one
    is likely to happen nearby.
  sec: 1351
  time: '22:31'
  who: Alexey
- header: Building Microbial Networks with CC Lasso
- line: Sometimes certain words just follow each other. Like after a verb, make, we
    have another noun like make noise, right? Maybe this is similar to what you do.
    This is what they do in NLP, and then they use simple statistics to calculate
    co-occurrence.
  sec: 1390
  time: '23:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: I remember it involved logarithms, but basically you do a statistical test
    to check how likely it is that these two things just happen to appear together.
    You find if it is statistically significant that they co-occur. Then you perform
    the test and can conclude that this is a bi-gram or pattern.
  sec: 1411
  time: '23:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: In recommender systems, you can find co-occurrence patterns too. For example,
    if I buy a phone, I might need a charger. Certain items are often bought together,
    and we can find these patterns in transactions. It’s a similar statistical approach.
  sec: 1430
  time: '23:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: And what you do looks very similar, right? What do you use there?
  sec: 1463
  time: '24:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: In that case, we use a method based on something called CC Lasso. It is based
    on the Lasso algorithm to predict potential interactions among the microorganisms.
    In the end, we calculate correlation values among every pair of microorganisms.
  sec: 1471
  time: '24:31'
  who: Sebastian
- line: So how does it work? Do you create like a regression model? With these interactions
    between organism A and organism B, right? If the coefficient is not zero, then
    it means that these things are co-abundant, right?
  sec: 1498
  time: '24:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's like we obtain a value between minus one and one, and then we set a threshold
    to define if the value remains in the table or not. Then we keep the significant
    values, and we have negative and positive correlations. These can have biological
    interpretations, but we should be careful with them.
  sec: 1522
  time: '25:22'
  who: Sebastian
- line: What does the negative correlation mean in this case?
  sec: 1555
  time: '25:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: It means that when one microorganism is in the sample, the other is not there.
    Maybe they release some components that prevent the other from living in the same
    environment.
  sec: 1561
  time: '26:01'
  who: Sebastian
- line: I see. So positive correlation means they like to coexist together, and negative
    correlation means that they don’t exist together, right?
  sec: 1581
  time: '26:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Yeah.
  sec: 1588
  time: '26:28'
  who: Sebastian
- line: But could it be just geographic? When you do this co-abundance pattern extraction,
    do you restrict yourself to a certain area? Let’s say you take a lake, take all
    the samples around this lake, and then do the analysis there. Maybe things potentially
    coexist, but in your samples you don’t see them.
  sec: 1590
  time: '26:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it can be.
  sec: 1608
  time: '26:48'
  who: Sebastian
- header: Protein–Ligand Simulation Basics
- line: That’s interesting. So did you have experience working with non-bioinformatics
    data before?
  sec: 1614
  time: '26:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: In general?
  sec: 1620
  time: '27:00'
  who: Sebastian
- line: In general, yeah.
  sec: 1623
  time: '27:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually most of the projects I’ve been working on have been in biology. Different
    types of biological data. At some point I worked more on simulations of proteins.
  sec: 1626
  time: '27:06'
  who: Sebastian
- line: In that case, you have proteins and ligands that interact, and then you run
    simulations. You simulate a water box, let the proteins move, apply physicochemical
    parameters, and then measure interactions. I did that during my bachelor's. Most
    of my work is biology related.
  sec: 1646
  time: '27:26'
  who: Sebastian
- line: The reason I’m asking is because I was curious if you observed any similar
    patterns. Right now you were talking about co-abundance patterns, and I thought
    this is very similar to what I was doing before.
  sec: 1680
  time: '28:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: It made me realize that my past experience working on something unrelated
    could actually transfer to bioinformatics. For me, that was really cool. So I
    was wondering if there are other parallels like that.
  sec: 1697
  time: '28:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s why I asked about your experience working on other types of data. I
    imagine someone listening might have similar thoughts. I see that there’s Mark
    who says he’s a microbiology student and an engineer.
  sec: 1716
  time: '28:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi Mark. Anyway, I know we prepared questions, but I’m sidelining a bit because
    I’m really interested in these things. You mentioned protein experiments and simulations
    of proteins.
  sec: 1733
  time: '28:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Was it a few years ago when Google managed to use AI for protein structure
    prediction?
  sec: 1755
  time: '29:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh yeah, AlphaFold. It predicts the structure of proteins from their sequences.
  sec: 1768
  time: '29:28'
  who: Sebastian
- line: For me, everyone was talking about this as a breakthrough. Nobody could do
    it before. Since my background in this is limited, I didn’t understand the significance.
  sec: 1774
  time: '29:34'
  who: Alexey
- header: Predicting Protein Folding in 3D
- line: Now I get a chance to talk to someone who understands these things. Can you
    explain in simple terms what’s the big deal about AlphaFold and why it matters?
  sec: 1798
  time: '29:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Basically, proteins are really important because they perform all the functions
    that living organisms do.
  sec: 1805
  time: '30:05'
  who: Sebastian
- line: So for me, I have this mentality of a gym bro. Proteins are important because
    after training you need to consume proteins.
  sec: 1817
  time: '30:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: But they are important on other levels too, right? Not just for that.
  sec: 1832
  time: '30:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. They are small molecules that perform all the jobs at small and large
    scales. There were many efforts to understand them because predicting their structure
    from their sequence is complex.
  sec: 1837
  time: '30:37'
  who: Sebastian
- line: The sequence is a string of amino acids, and when proteins perform their functions,
    they fold into 3D structures. This folding determines their function.
  sec: 1858
  time: '30:58'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Okay, so you have a string, and when you put it into real space in 3D, it
    starts folding. The same sequence can fold differently and serve different functions,
    right?
  sec: 1887
  time: '31:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. The search space is huge, larger than the number of stars in the
    universe. Predicting the 3D structure from the sequence is extremely difficult.
  sec: 1906
  time: '31:46'
  who: Sebastian
- line: There were many traditional approaches, and there’s a competition called CASP
    that evaluates these prediction methods. When AlphaFold entered, it performed
    far better than other teams.
  sec: 1935
  time: '32:15'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Knowing the structure from the sequence is crucial because doing it experimentally
    in a wet lab is very time-consuming. My friend’s PhD project was dedicated to
    determining the structure of one protein.
  sec: 1970
  time: '32:50'
  who: Sebastian
- header: AlphaFold Revolution in Protein Prediction
- line: It takes years, but AlphaFold can do it in seconds. It’s incredible.
  sec: 2010
  time: '33:30'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Instead of five years.
  sec: 2022
  time: '33:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Depending on the type of protein, simpler ones can be predicted with
    about 90 percent confidence. More complex ones still need experimental validation.
  sec: 2028
  time: '33:48'
  who: Sebastian
- line: What are the practical implications? Can we do drug discovery faster now?
  sec: 2061
  time: '34:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. We can do drug discovery and explore protein applications in different
    fields like agriculture and industry. Enzymes can accelerate specific processes.
    Applications are everywhere.
  sec: 2067
  time: '34:27'
  who: Sebastian
- line: And these proteins are important because they’re building blocks for many
    organisms, right?
  sec: 2096
  time: '34:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 2102
  time: '35:02'
  who: Sebastian
- line: That’s why after training you consume proteins they’re the building blocks.
    The body deconstructs them and uses their parts for its purposes, right?
  sec: 2102
  time: '35:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. There are different types of proteins. Some assemble into complex structures,
    while others perform functions like carrying oxygen, such as hemoglobin. Every
    biological function involves proteins.
  sec: 2127
  time: '35:27'
  who: Sebastian
- line: And living organisms consume these proteins, and the body uses their parts
    for its needs, right?
  sec: 2160
  time: '36:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Interesting. I can’t say I understood everything, but it’s clearer now. Thank
    you.
  sec: 2173
  time: '36:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: You worked on quite a few projects. The document mentions MCW2 Graph, VueGen,
    and VueCore. What are these projects and what do they do?
  sec: 2180
  time: '36:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I already mentioned MCW2 Graph. It’s the knowledge graph with microorganisms.
  sec: 2200
  time: '36:40'
  who: Sebastian
- header: Inside the MCW2 Knowledge Graph
- line: Last year we talked about co-abundance patterns. Once you extract the patterns,
    you can put them in a graph. These nodes have positive coefficients, these have
    negative ones, right?
  sec: 2205
  time: '36:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Every node is a microorganism, and there is an edge if there’s a co-abundance
    pattern between them. We created these graphs and enriched them with metadata.
  sec: 2223
  time: '37:03'
  who: Sebastian
- line: For example, we know a microorganism releases a specific metabolite or lives
    in a specific biome. We added that information to build a knowledge graph.
  sec: 2240
  time: '37:20'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Then we applied clustering algorithms to find microbial communities involved
    in specific pathways or biological processes, important in wastewater treatment
    and other fields.
  sec: 2253
  time: '37:33'
  who: Sebastian
- line: I just Googled MCW2 Graph and saw your article “Building a Knowledge Graph
    of the Wastewater Treatment Microbiome.” You’re the author, that’s great. It describes
    it as an open-source knowledge graph.
  sec: 2275
  time: '37:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s interesting. How can people use it now?
  sec: 2304
  time: '38:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: We created a Streamlit web application with exploratory data analysis and
    microbial association networks for every biome. People can download the dump file
    and open it in Neo4j.
  sec: 2311
  time: '38:31'
  who: Sebastian
- line: They can also access the raw CSV file or visualize it on the web application.
  sec: 2333
  time: '38:53'
  who: Sebastian
- line: When I have this Neo4j database, what can I do with it?
  sec: 2347
  time: '39:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can run graph algorithms like clustering or centrality analysis. You have
    the experimental edges we inferred and the extra metadata.
  sec: 2353
  time: '39:13'
  who: Sebastian
- line: So you can analyze things you didn’t directly observe but that the graph structure
    suggests. You can infer potential co-abundance relationships, right?
  sec: 2377
  time: '39:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Mhm, exactly.
  sec: 2394
  time: '39:54'
  who: Sebastian
- header: 'VueGen: Automating Scientific Reports'
- line: That’s really interesting. And the other two projects, VueGen and VueCore?
  sec: 2394
  time: '39:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s what I worked on last year, after my master’s. VueGen is a Python package
    that automates the creation of scientific reports.
  sec: 2400
  time: '40:00'
  who: Sebastian
- line: You provide a directory with a specific structure containing tables, plots,
    and files. It can handle static or interactive plots, network data, or HTML files.
    With one command, you can generate documents like PDF, HTML, DOCX, presentations,
    or Streamlit web apps.
  sec: 2414
  time: '40:14'
  who: Sebastian
- line: The idea is to make it easier to create these reports.
  sec: 2441
  time: '40:41'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Yeah, I just shared the links to MCW2 Graph and VueGen in the chat. I also
    put them in the description.
  sec: 2448
  time: '40:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: It only has 28 stars. Let’s increase that number. Everyone watching, please
    do the same.
  sec: 2460
  time: '41:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay, now you have a star. What do you use inside? Do you just parse the data,
    or do you use something intelligent like an LLM? What’s happening inside?
  sec: 2471
  time: '41:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now under the hood we are using Quarto for the Quarto and Streamlit
    projects. This is traditional object-oriented programming. We have not yet added
    large language models to interpret the information, but that is a project we plan
    for the future. Basically, we interpret the directory structure and then create
    a YAML file with the information, including paths, descriptions, and other details.
    For Streamlit apps, we generate Python scripts for each tab of the web application,
    and for Quarto we create a QMD file, which is a markdown file that Quarto can
    render into PDFs or other formats.
  sec: 2485
  time: '41:25'
  who: Sebastian
- line: I see it links dependencies. VueGen uses Quarto to generate various report
    types, and when I click, I can learn more. I had no idea this library existed.
    I also noticed that VueGen is available on Bioconda. What is Bioconda?
  sec: 2549
  time: '42:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Bioconda is basically a branch of Conda that contains packages related to
    biology, bioinformatics, bioengineering, and similar fields.
  sec: 2568
  time: '42:48'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Are there many libraries in Bioconda? I see there are 11,733. That is a lot.
    People have been busy creating biological packages for Anaconda. I had no knowledge
    about this whatsoever. It is interesting. So I am thinking of a direct application  someone
    working in a lab doing experiments. With this tool, they can point to a folder
    and generate a report.
  sec: 2582
  time: '43:02'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'VueCore: Visualizing OMIX Data'
- line: The report can be in whatever format, such as Streamlit, Jupyter Notebook,
    or PDF. That is nice. The other view you mentioned was it Vuecore?
  sec: 2636
  time: '43:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, Vuecore. The idea is to make it easier to generate interactive and static
    visualizations from omics data. Omics data refers to things like genomics, proteomics,
    and metabolomics. Proteomics focuses on proteins, genomics on genes, and metabolomics
    on metabolites. You take samples and identify the peptides and proteins in them.
    Then you can analyze the different layers of data and integrate them to have a
    holistic view of a living system.
  sec: 2649
  time: '44:09'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Interesting. I see that we have a few questions. Maybe we can cover them before
    we run out of time. Yekaterina is asking which beginner-friendly bioinformatics
    projects would best showcase her skills to future employers. If someone wants
    to work in bioinformatics, what kind of projects should they do for their portfolio?
  sec: 2708
  time: '45:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think what helped me during my bachelor’s degree was finding a topic that
    I liked and playing with packages from Bioconda. There are many tools for parsing
    data and strings. It is easy to test these packages and apply them in a specific
    domain that interests you. You could also create a simple Streamlit web app to
    demonstrate what the tool does. When I was in my bachelor’s program, many biologists
    were doing things manually. Simple tasks like creating a batch script to parse
    files made a huge difference.
  sec: 2742
  time: '45:42'
  who: Sebastian
- line: Things that took an hour in a graphical interface could be done in a minute
    on the command line. I really liked discovering that. Playing with the command
    line and commands like grep or cut helped me a lot. For a bigger project, you
    can explore Bioconda or Bioconductor in R. The bioinformatics community is still
    larger in R, and there are many datasets available. You can test the tools, run
    exploratory analyses, and showcase that work.

- header: Using AI and LLMs in Bioinformatics
- line: Do you use AI or large language models in your work these days? For me as
    a developer, AI helps tremendously, so I assume it is similar in bioinformatics
    too, right?
  sec: 2870
  time: '47:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, large language models and generative AI are becoming very important in
    this field. Many people are working on tools to integrate and improve them. I
    personally use them a lot for brainstorming ideas or writing documentation. In
    my recent projects, we also wanted to implement MLOps protocols to test how they
    would perform.
  sec: 2891
  time: '48:11'
  who: Sebastian
- line: 'Amazing. Another question: which online resources, tutorials, or courses
    would you recommend for biochemistry graduates interested in biotech and bioinformatics?
    Biochemistry sounds like an intersection between biology and chemistry, right?'
  sec: 2934
  time: '48:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I would say right now I do not remember a specific resource, but I know
    there are good curated lists on GitHub. There is one called Awesome Bioinformatics
    that includes many useful courses and tutorials.
  sec: 2954
  time: '49:14'
  who: Sebastian

- header: R vs Python in Bioinformatics Tools
- line: Mark says he uses Bioconda too. I did not know about this. So Bioconductor
    is in R, and Bioconda is similar but for Python, right?
  sec: 3025
  time: '50:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. The community is still bigger in R, but more people are transitioning
    to Python. Most packages are still published in R. Sometimes bioinformatics tools
    are developed by scientists who are not trained software developers, so when you
    try to scale those tools, you might find issues.
  sec: 3040
  time: '50:40'
  who: Sebastian
- line: And you need to scale because you work with large amounts of data, right?
    When those libraries are not scalable, what do you do? Do you rewrite them in
    Python?
  sec: 3072
  time: '51:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: It can be complicated. Sometimes you need to expand the source code or contact
    the developers to ask for help with a specific use case. It can be tricky.
  sec: 3095
  time: '51:35'
  who: Sebastian
- line: I wonder if large language models can help with that. With coding agents,
    you can easily translate from one language to another and even fix bugs. For example,
    I can take a project with no tests and ask a code assistant to write tests for
    it. It tries to understand the project and generate them automatically. That is
    really cool. What are you working on now?
  sec: 3113
  time: '51:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: My last project was Viewer, which I just finished. The idea was to support
    different plotting libraries for visualizations.
  sec: 3146

    it clearly before. You are now relaxing in Ecuador, right?
  sec: 3197
  time: '53:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. That was my last project, and now I am taking a break here in Ecuador
    to enjoy the mountains. I really like hiking and climbing. In Denmark, I did not
    have that opportunity, so here I am making the most of it.
  sec: 3216

    jungle.
  sec: 3243
  time: '54:03'
  who: Sebastian
- line: That must be amazing. I actually have another event starting soon, so I need
    to go. Sebastian, thanks a lot. It was really nice talking to you. I learned many
    new things. I suspected proteins were important not just for the gym but for other
    purposes too. Thanks for explaining that. I also finally understand the buzz about
    this on social media.
  sec: 3250

  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks for joining us and sharing your insights. For me, the aha moment was
    realizing that with my experience, I can actually relate to what you did. That
    was interesting. Thanks to everyone for joining and asking questions. Give a star
    to Sebastian’s project and also to Viewer since it is open source.
  sec: 3289
