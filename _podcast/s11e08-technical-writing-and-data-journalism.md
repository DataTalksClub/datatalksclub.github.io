short: Technical Writing and Data Journalism
title: Technical Writing and Data Journalism
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about technical writing and data journalism. We have
    a special guest today, Angelica. Angelica is a researcher at the Institute of
    Informatics and Telematics in Italy. Her research interests include data science,
    machine learning, text analytics, data visualization, data journalism, web applications,
    and recently she became also interested in data engineering. She is also a professor
    at the University of Pisa, where she teaches data journalism. Welcome, Angelica.
  sec: 113
  time: '1:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi, nice to meet you. For me, it's a pleasure to be here with you today.
  sec: 142
  time: '2:22'
  who: Angelica
- header: Angelica’s background
- line: Yeah, likewise, Thanks for accepting the invite to be here. I also want to
    mention that the questions for today's interview are prepared by Johanna Bayer.
    Thanks, Johanna, for preparing the questions. Angelica, before we go into our
    main topic of writing and data journalism, I wanted to ask you about your background.
    Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 149
  time: '2:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Indeed, since I was a teenager, my big dream was to become a computer
    scientist. Because I had a computer (this was the late 90s period) and I decided
    to understand how a computer works. And so my dream continued – in university,
    I studied computer science. Then I devoted all my career to the research field.
    In fact, now I’m a researcher. At the beginning, I worked on network security
    with the focus on cryptography, reputation, and similar stuff. I got my PhD in
    this field.
  sec: 172
  time: '2:52'
  who: Angelica
- line: But after my PhD, I realized that web applications were more appealing to
    me than computer security, so I moved to this field. Next, I landed in data science,
    and I worked on data science projects for many years. Only recently, I'm moving
    to data engineering, because I like to explore new things. As you can see, my
    career is slightly different than that of other people, because I always remained
    in the research field. I changed only the topic that I studied. For me, I can
    see that I’m a privileged person because I can decide the topic to study and this
    is a very interesting aspect of academia and research.
  sec: 172
  time: '2:52'
  who: Angelica
- line: Just curious, what are you researching now in data engineering? To me, it
    looks like engineering topics are more practical. It's more about know-how and
    less about research. But maybe I'm a bit far from that. So I'm really curious
    – what kind of research topics are there in data engineering?
  sec: 281
  time: '4:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, indeed. I'm studying the topic and so I don't know if I will have an
    idea how to improve something. But given my expertise, a possible idea could be
    to add some security aspects to the data – to maybe help recognize if data is
    manipulated or something like this. I don't know. I'm studying the topic at the
    moment. I'm also writing a book about this topic. So we will see.
  sec: 303
  time: '5:03'
  who: Angelica
- line: Okay. That's quite on-topic to today's conversation, right? Writing. You are
    learning data engineering by writing a book about that?
  sec: 347
  time: '5:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 356
  time: '5:56'
  who: Angelica
- header: Angelica’s books
- line: That's quite a good way to learn something. [chuckles] [Angelica agrees] You
    already have a few books, right? So you have at least one that I know of, which
    is Comet for Data Science [Angelica agrees] Have you written any other books?
  sec: 357
  time: '5:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: In the past I've written some novels, but I was very young – some novels,
    short tales, but nothing interesting. Now I'm writing a book about Presto, the
    very famous database also used by Meta. Yes.
  sec: 374
  time: '6:14'
  who: Angelica
- line: I think they changed their name recently, right? So it's not Presto anymore.
    Or is it two different things?
  sec: 401
  time: '6:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no, no. The original name was Presto and then they forked into two different
    databases, which are Presto and Trino. Now there are two different projects supported
    by two different foundations.
  sec: 404
  time: '6:44'
  who: Angelica
- line: Ah, okay. At our company, OLX, we used to use Presto and then one day, I connected
    to Presto and it said Trino. So I was like “Okay, what happened?” [laughs] Then
    it turned out that our data engineers updated the version and it became Trino.
  sec: 427
  time: '7:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: They are quite similar, but they derive from two different organizations.
  sec: 445
  time: '7:25'
  who: Angelica
- line: I guess it's like LibreOffice and OpenOffice, right? They have the same history,
    but then at some point, they branched away from one another.
  sec: 452
  time: '7:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I think so.
  sec: 459
  time: '7:39'
  who: Angelica
- header: Data journalism
- line: One of the topics that I wanted to talk to you about is data journalism. This
    is one of your research interests. You're also a professor at the University of
    Pisa, when you teach this. [Angelica agrees] So what is data journalism?
  sec: 463
  time: '7:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, data journalism is data-driven journalism in the sense that, similar
    to any data science project, it collects, analyzes, filters data, to create interesting
    stories. Data journalism is slightly different from data storytelling or data
    narrative, which are other fields because data storytelling, for example, is the
    art of telling stories from data. They could seem like the same thing, but they
    are not, because the objective of data journalism is to tell the news and to use
    data to confirm the story it is telling. For example, you can see long articles
    that talk about something and then they use data to confirm the story which is
    narrated.
  sec: 481
  time: '8:01'
  who: Angelica
- line: Additionally, for example, with respect to data science, which is another
    aspect – in a data journalism story, you usually don't have the analysis part,
    which is a big part in data science. Usually you don't use machine learning or
    data analysis models in general – you don't train a model in data journalism.
    The huge part is to build a storyboard and to collect data. While in data science,
    you use big data, in data journalism, you also focus on small datasets because
    the idea is to have accurate information.
  sec: 481
  time: '8:01'
  who: Angelica
- line: You have to tell the truth and you cannot approximate things. For example,
    if you train a model in data science or in machine learning, this model has an
    accuracy, for example, of 80%. But in data journalism, you have to say true news
    – you cannot have an accuracy of 80%. It should be 50%. This is the main difference.
    There are also other differences. But to give an overview, this is the first aspect.
  sec: 481
  time: '8:01'
  who: Angelica
- line: Can you give an example? The articles I'm reading in the economist or similar
    journals or newspapers – are they doing data journalism? Or is it just regular
    journalism?
  sec: 656
  time: '10:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, they’re not. In general, I tell my students to build data journalism stories
    but in practice, I don't write my data journalism stories. I help my students
    to build their stories, to collect the data. There are many websites. For example,
    one interesting website is the Washington Post website.
  sec: 671
  time: '11:11'
  who: Angelica
- line: If you search on Google for “The Washington Post data journalism,” you will
    find their group (their laboratory). They write wonderful stories and you can
    learn how to organize a story. But usually almost all the newspapers have a dedicated
    data journalism laboratory. Very specific.
  sec: 671
  time: '11:11'
  who: Angelica
- line: It's not about fact checking, right? It's different. It's more about supporting
    your agreements with data.
  sec: 749
  time: '12:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 754
  time: '12:34'
  who: Angelica
- line: I'm just trying to think of an example. Can you think of anything? Something
    you’ve maybe read recently? I know that Musk bought Twitter. Have you seen any
    stories about that, which are a good example of data journalism?
  sec: 755
  time: '12:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. For example, there was an article by the Washington Post, which talks
    about the barriers (the walls) that were built in 2015. And to avoid that, migrants
    went from Southeast Asia to Europe. They use some data and graphs (visualizations)
    to show how this process happened across the years. If you want, after, I can
    send you the link. But at the moment, I don't have it. It's a very, very impressive
    story. Other stories analyze, for example, how oppressors in some lands use the
    lands to oppress the local people – to build coffee plants and similar stuff.
    They use the data to prove this.
  sec: 772
  time: '12:52'
  who: Angelica
- line: Yeah, interesting. Yes, please do send the link. It would be quite interesting
    to take a look. What I understood regarding the main difference between usual
    journalism and data journalism is that, in usual journalism, you have a story,
    but it's not necessarily based on data. You just present some facts but you don't
    show diagrams – you don't show graphs, you don't show anything to support the
    story. While in data journalism, you have some data source, you have some data
    visualization and then you base your story on the data. Right?
  sec: 874
  time: '14:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I think that the challenging aspect in data journalism is to search for
    data. Because data is hidden on the web, and data journalists must discover it.
    Instead, for example, in data science, so you already have data – your company
    provider provides you with your data, so you have to analyze them. In data journalism,
    you have to search for new data. Also, small data can be used. It's not important
    to have big data. The most important aspect is that the data should be as accurate
    as possible. Otherwise, you deliver fake news.
  sec: 911
  time: '15:11'
  who: Angelica
- header: How Angelica got into data journalism
- line: How did you get into data journalism? Is it something that you started your
    career with? Or is this something that accidentally happened to you? I think you
    mentioned that you actually researched cryptography, right? [Angelica agrees]
    Then from doing cryptography, how did you end up doing data driven? They're quite
    unrelated, right? Or are they?
  sec: 973
  time: '16:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, they are not related. When I moved to web applications, my boss asked
    me to start a course about web applications. We started with a course at university
    but then, he had this smart idea to change the course to data journalism. I don't
    know why. [cross-talk]
  sec: 997
  time: '16:37'
  who: Angelica
- line: They’re not related at all, right? [chuckles]
  sec: 1026
  time: '17:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, not really. [chuckles]
  sec: 1027
  time: '17:07'
  who: Angelica
- line: He just said, “Okay, let's change to a completely random different topic.”?
  sec: 1029
  time: '17:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Because he understood that web applications became old, I don’t know.
    Then he decided to involve me in this new topic. I accepted it. I was surprised
    by his choice, but usually, he makes good choices. In the end, I think that he
    was right because I liked this course. Over the years, the course has improved.
    Also, thanks to the feedback provided by students.
  sec: 1034
  time: '17:14'
  who: Angelica
- line: Here at the University of Pisa, there is a mechanism where every year, students
    provide feedback about each professor and how the course must be improved. Over
    the years, we have improved this. We are still improving it, but I think now it's
    quite mature.
  sec: 1034
  time: '17:14'
  who: Angelica
- header: The field of digital humanities and Angelica’s data journalism course
- line: Who are the students? What kind of students is this course for? Is it for
    technical students – for students who study computer science and want to learn
    more about journalism? Or is it for those who are studying less technical topics
    and want to get into data?
  sec: 1113
  time: '18:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: They are in a particular area, because they are humanists with a background
    in computer science. They study digital humanities and have knowledge both of
    the humanities and computer science. It's a new course, which is not everywhere
    – at least in Italy, it's not everywhere. The name is humanistic informatics,
    which is the rough translation.
  sec: 1129
  time: '18:49'
  who: Angelica
- line: That’s pretty interesting. To be honest, this is the first time I hear about
    such a field.
  sec: 1167
  time: '19:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. This profile is very required in the digital humanities field. For example,
    to build or work in archives, in cultural heritage, digital collections, and similar
    stuff.
  sec: 1173
  time: '19:33'
  who: Angelica
- line: How technical is this? From your description, I think you need to be a good
    writer to write the story. The story has to be there. But how technical should
    you be, in addition to being a good writer, in order to be a data journalist?
  sec: 1190
  time: '19:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. There are two options. You may not know anything about programming languages
    – you may be able to use tools like Tableau. In this case, if you don't use anything,
    it's okay. Or, if you have a technical background, usually the most popular programming
    language that students use is Python. But this is at a high level. You don't focus,
    for example, on heavy programming. You just need to know how to clean some data,
    how to manipulate them. It's very easy. Everyone can do this. But the alternative
    could be Tableau, so you don't need to be technical at all.
  sec: 1213
  time: '20:13'
  who: Angelica
- line: Is the course in Italian, or in English?
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Unfortunately, it's in Italian.
  sec: 1277
  time: '21:17'
  who: Angelica
- line: Do you know any other courses that are in English that are open? Let's say
    if I want to go and learn more about data journalism, do you know any open courses
    that I can check out?
  sec: 1283
  time: '21:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know if it's open, but I think there is one course on Coursera. I
    can send you the link. Maybe you can share it with the community. But I don't
    know if it's still available. It describes the aspects more from a journalism
    point of view. Also the books that I have read on data journalism, focus on the
    journalism and then they describe a little data. Maybe my next book could be on
    data journalism. [chuckles] But it's a very niche sector, so maybe there will
    not be an audience for this book. I don't know.
  sec: 1297
  time: '21:37'
  who: Angelica
- header: Technical articles vs data journalism articles
- line: But as I understood, the audience that you write for in data journalism is
    the general public. Let's say you write an article for The Washington Post. The
    readers for this article are just ordinary people, right? They don't have to have
    a background in a specific area.
  sec: 1358
  time: '22:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on the topic of your article. If you write an article for The Washington
    Post, yes – probably the general user is okay. But if you write an article for
    a children’s magazine, for example, the audience are children. So you have to
    think about your audience before writing your article. But this is also true when
    you write a book – a technical book or an article.
  sec: 1377
  time: '22:57'
  who: Angelica
- line: Everything you write, before writing, you have to think about the audience.
    I think this is the first step. What does this mean? It means that you have to
    focus on the audience’s needs. So you know who will read your book or your article?
    What are their interests? Which skills do they have? And are you writing for a
    technical audience or not? This is a very important aspect before writing everything.
  sec: 1377
  time: '22:57'
  who: Angelica
- line: The reason I ask this question is that I know that you do a lot of technical
    writing. I don't know how many articles you wrote on Medium – it must be hundreds
    by now, right? [cross-talk]
  sec: 1460
  time: '24:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: 70 maybe. [chuckles]
  sec: 1472
  time: '24:32'
  who: Angelica
- line: You're quite a prolific writer. The articles you wrote that I know about,
    they are technical articles. It's technical writing, which I guess is quite different
    from the articles we've been talking about so far – data journalism. Would you
    say that data journalism is not technical writing?
  sec: 1475
  time: '24:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it's not technical writing. It's for general audiences. Also, the language
    you use is different. But there are a variety of languages that you have to use.
    For example, if you write a scientific paper, you need to write in a certain way.
    If you write a technical book, you have to use another type of language. If you
    write for data journalism, you have to write another way. So you should focus
    on your audience – this is the problem.
  sec: 1495
  time: '24:55'
  who: Angelica
- line: We kind of have two topics then, right? We have data journalism and we have
    technical writing. We already talked about data journalism, but what is technical
    writing? What makes writing technical? If we just add code, does it become technical?
    Or is there more to that?
  sec: 1533
  time: '25:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that when you’re doing technical writing you should talk about something
    technical, for example, how to set up something, how to perform a task, how to
    do something. Technical writing differs from, for example, a research article
    because a research article discusses some concepts more from a theoretical point
    of view. You can still have some implementation parts, but they demonstrate your
    ideas.
  sec: 1551
  time: '25:51'
  who: Angelica
- line: In technical writing, instead, I think that you describe how to solve a problem.
    For example, if you write a technical book, this book can be a reference manual
    where you teach something. Also, the language you use should be sure, in the sense
    that if you say something, you cannot say, for example, “You can do this.” You
    have to say, “Do this,” because you are sure of what you are saying. There are
    these differences.
  sec: 1551
  time: '25:51'
  who: Angelica
- line: So, something like, “How to prepare the environment for a GPU”. That would
    be a very technical article, right? Because you have a sequence of steps and you
    have some screenshots, you have pieces of code, and then you just follow this.
    [Angelica agrees] I guess this one is easy. But let's say, if we’re talking about
    how to do data visualization. This is also technical, right? [Angelica agrees]
    You walk the reader through a guide – a how-to? [Angelica agrees] Is it always
    like that? You just walk the reader through a sequence of things and show how
    to get to the result they need?
  sec: 1636
  time: '27:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. You can also describe, you can report some things, I think. You can provide
    some examples about something. In my book, Comet for Data Science, I also describe
    some general concepts to introduce the reader to some concepts.
  sec: 1685
  time: '28:05'
  who: Angelica
- line: Like “What is machine learning,” for example, right?
  sec: 1712
  time: '28:32'
  who: Alexey
- header: Transforming reports into data storytelling
- line: Yes, for example – the general overview. But it's different from a research
    article where you have to explain the details about concepts. Another thing, I
    think that the main difference between research articles and technical articles,
    is that in research articles you discover something new – you describe something
    new. In a technical article, instead, you describe existing things.
  sec: 1714
  time: '28:34'
  who: Angelica
- line: Maybe, you know that there are companies like StackOverflow that run surveys.
    Every year, they ask people (members of StackOverflow) about their interests,
    about the tools they use, about the tools they want to use, tools they want to
    learn, the tools they hate, languages they hate, languages they love, their salaries,
    etc. It's quite a massive questionnaire. I don't know if you ever took part, but
    maybe you took part in similar ones. I think O'Reilly does this as well. There
    are quite a few companies that are doing this.
  sec: 1759
  time: '29:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: So they collect this data, and then one or two months later, they release
    a report (a PDF). How would you classify this report? Is it data journalism? Is
    it technical writing? Is it data storytelling? What is it?
  sec: 1759
  time: '29:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on how the report is written. If you only report data as they are
    then it’s a report. If you extract a story from your data it can become data storytelling
    or also a data journalism story. Recently, I have also read a book about data
    storytelling, which used this example of a Stack Overflow report, and they described
    how to transform this raw data into a story. This was very interesting. This was
    a case of a self-published book because the author decided to self-publish and
    it was a very, very interesting book. Maybe I can send you a title on that so
    you can share it with the community.
  sec: 1810
  time: '30:10'
  who: Angelica
- line: So let's say we have this report. If we just do basic data analysis – we aggregate
    data, we show all these pie charts, line charts, bar charts, and all these things
    and we put them in a PDF – and we say that, “Okay, this is the most popular language,
    this is the most hated language, this is how much data scientists earn,” then
    this is just report. [Angelica agrees]
  sec: 1893
  time: '31:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: But if we write an article about different programming languages, and we say,
    “Java and C are the most popular programming languages,” and then we add a chart
    that shows that, that proves, “This is based on this dataset,” and then we maybe
    talk about the story behind some of these programming languages – then it would
    be more like data journalism. Right?
  sec: 1893
  time: '31:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. In addition to that, to transform a report into a data journalism story,
    for example, you can add context to your data. For example, in the case of programming
    languages, you can group data by the year – the age of the people that are answering
    the questions – and you can see, for example, that the 80s generation likes Java.
    Now you can start searching for why this category of people likes Java more than
    the other languages. Maybe they studied Java at university, and so on.
  sec: 1945
  time: '32:25'
  who: Angelica
- line: Here, you transform your raw data into a story by adding context. Finally,
    the main objective when you want to transform your data into a story is to add
    what we call “wisdom,” which is to attach to your data, an ethic, a message, a
    call to action to your audience – because the final objective of data storytelling,
    or a data journalism story in general, is to call the audience to action. Then
    this is not a report anymore. It's a story.
  sec: 1945
  time: '32:25'
  who: Angelica
- line: In a report, do we have a call to action? We could, right? “Share it with
    your friends.”
  sec: 2064
  time: '34:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's not sufficient. [laughs]
  sec: 2073
  time: '34:33'
  who: Angelica
- line: Okay. [laughs] I guess companies usually do this to get some exposure, right?
    So the real reason they're doing this is so that people start sharing it – they
    link to their websites so that there are more users coming in.
  sec: 2077
  time: '34:37'

- line: Maybe in this case – the call to action in the previous example of Java people
    could be to try to get these people who like Java to learn Python. “Invite these
    people to learn Python because Python is more recent.” I don't know, something
    like that.

- line: I see a comment in the live chat from Adonis. “So reports to your stakeholders
    can be classified as technical writing too?” Angelica, what do you think about
    this? Is it an accurate observation?
  sec: 2113
  time: '35:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that it depends on how the report is built. Because I'm currently
    studying data storytelling – there are many books about this. One of the most
    popular ones is Storytelling With Data by Cole Knaflic. It's a very famous book
    which says that when you talk to your stakeholders, you have to tell them stories
    and not just the report. You have to invite them to make some decisions based
    on the data, obviously. So I strongly encourage you to transform your sad and
    boring reports into data stories.

- line: We have a question. “How do you make sure that an article that you're writing
    has the right amount of data visualization? Not too much, not too little – just
    the right amount.”
  sec: 2180
  time: '36:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that to explain the concept, maybe one graph is enough. So you have
    to use one concept per graph. Don't show many concepts in the same graph. It's
    very confusing. Then, if you have to explain many concepts, you need many charts.
    But I think that the audience will get confused, because the idea is to transmit
    just a single message. All the graphs that you put in your report must be in accordance
    with this message.
  sec: 2193
  time: '36:33'
  who: Angelica
- line: Don't think about whether there are too few graphs, because the most important
    aspect of your report is not the amount of graphs, but the message that you want
    to transmit. I think that in some cases, a table is better than a graph because
    it's clearer. If you have just two or three data points, it's useless to use a
    graph. Don’t use a pie chart. [chuckles]
  sec: 2193

  sec: 2299

- line: I fight pie charts with all my heart, because I think that when it comes to
    pie charts – if there are many, many slices in the pie chart, you don't understand
    anything. If there are only two slices in your pie chart, it gives you the Pac
    Man idea. I don't know if you know Pac Man, which is a character from some video
    games. It seems that the greater slice wants to eat the small one. [laughs] This
    has a negative effect on the audience. So don't use pie charts. [chuckles]

- header: Article length
- line: You mentioned an interesting thing – a purpose for an article should be to
    convey a single message and all the visualizations you use (all the charts) should
    support this single message. Since you wrote so many different articles (170)
    how long are these articles usually? Are they six minutes long to read?
  sec: 2352
  time: '39:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes – five, six minutes. On Medium, there are also some very long articles
    – about 15 minutes. To tell the truth, I don't have the time to write these long
    articles, so I keep them short. I’ve also started a publication on Medium, which
    is called Syntax Error (at the moment, it's very small) where the main objective
    is to solve some problems very shortly – like Stack Overflow in Medium. Maybe
    in the Slack community, if someone wants to write or participate with this publication,
    they could drop me a message, and I will be happy to add them as a writer.

- header: The process of writing an article
- line: Can you walk us through the process of creating an article? You said that
    your articles are usually five, six minutes long – so they're super-focused on
    conveying a single message. Correct me if I'm mistaken – this is what you start
    your article with, thinking of what this message could be. Right?
  sec: 2447
  time: '40:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes – an overview of the topic. You start by giving an overview of the topic,
    then you describe how you solved your problem. Usually, I write technical articles
    that solve some common programming problems. I describe an example which solves
    the problem and then I give a summary. The structure is very, very simple. You
    could write something more complex, but in my case, it's very simple. I also usually
    provide the code of the article in a separate repository, which is well-appreciated
    on GitHub. It’s small, but it's appreciated.
  sec: 2467
  time: '41:07'
  who: Angelica
- line: The format, as I understood it, is – first you have a problem, then you show
    the solution, and then at the end, you talk about the result. Right? In this format,
    you come up with some outline. You have this outline in this form and then you
    add text, some code, and illustrations. [Angelica agrees] How many illustrations
    do you usually add?
  sec: 2526
  time: '42:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: I generally add an illustration at the beginning to capture the attention
    of the reader, and then maybe technical illustrations related to the problem to
    be solved. For example, if I need to draw a graph, I show the graph.
  sec: 2552
  time: '42:32'
  who: Angelica
- line: So when do you think about illustrations? When you have an outline, but you
    haven't started writing the article? Or at the end you see, “Okay, there is just
    too much text. I need to add a picture.”? How does it usually work for you?
  sec: 2576
  time: '42:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, when I finish the topic, I stop the article. But if the article is too
    short, I try to extend it, for example, by extending the example or extending
    the overview, adding some general concepts and similar things.
  sec: 2591
  time: '43:11'
  who: Angelica
- header: Finding writing topics
- line: How do you find topics? You said that you usually focus on a specific problem,
    and then show how to solve this specific problem. Where do you find these problems?
    Is it something where, let's say, you are working on a particular thing and then
    you have this error? [Angelica agrees] Is this your main source of inspiration?
    Or how do you usually find topics?
  sec: 2620
  time: '43:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Usually I write on the problems that I personally have because I think that
    maybe they could be useful for the community. But some other times, I read on
    social networks like LinkedIn or Twitter for new libraries, for example – I try
    to test them and then they write an article about the topic. But most of the time,
    I take note of my problems and how I solved them. For me, this is also a way to
    keep track of how I solve my problems.
  sec: 2643
  time: '44:03'
  who: Angelica
- line: In fact, I would like to suggest to the community to also take note of how
    they solve their problems. Because we are used to searching on Google, but maybe
    if a problem comes again, twice or three times, we need to search again, on Google
    for the same problem. Instead, if you keep track of the problem by writing an
    article, we have the solution already available. And this is my strategy. Maybe
    if after 10 months, I have the same problem, I know exactly how to solve it.

- header: How Angelica got into writing a book (communication with publishers)
- line: These articles that you write – they're very focused, very short, and to the
    point. And then you also wrote a book. A book is not a five-minute read – it's
    something more comprehensive. I have a lot of questions about the book, but maybe
    you can tell us how you ended up writing a book? You said you were writing some
    novels, but then at some point you decided to write a technical book. So how did
    this happen?
  sec: 2735
  time: '45:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: The situation was different because I didn't choose to write a book.
  sec: 2766
  time: '46:06'
  who: Angelica
- line: Did somebody force you? [chuckles]
  sec: 2782
  time: '46:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no, no. [chuckles] My idea, my dream since I was a child was to write
    a book. But at some point, I received an email from an acquisition editor, who
    asked me to write a book. I was surprised by this. Maybe he read my articles and
    contacted me. At the beginning, I didn't know if it was the best thing to do.
    But then I decided to accept and then I wrote this book. Also, he proposed the
    topic to me. So instead, the topic was proposed by them (by the publisher) and
    I accepted it.
  sec: 2785
  time: '46:25'
  who: Angelica
- line: But it didn’t come out of the blue, right? Was it something related to some
    of the articles you wrote? You probably must have written an article about Comet
    for Data Science and that's why they thought of you.
  sec: 2844
  time: '47:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I wrote an article about Comet – an overview of Comet. I’m also a contributor
    to the Heartbeat publication, which is a publication by Comet. So maybe they contacted
    me for these reasons.
  sec: 2857
  time: '47:37'
  who: Angelica
- line: Interesting. Basically, the recipe is you write and publish your articles
    on Medium and some other platforms, and then publishers might reach out to you.
    Right? At least this is how it happened with you?
  sec: 2880
  time: '48:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I think that it could be a great strategy if you want to write something
    – to build a portfolio of articles which show your capabilities and your writing
    skills and then maybe someone from the acquisition team of a publisher can contact
    you. An alternative could be to contact an acquisition editor directly. For example,
    you can go on LinkedIn, search for a publisher, you search for the acquisition
    editor in the company, and you ask them if they are interested in some books.
  sec: 2900
  time: '48:20'
  who: Angelica
- line: So you approach them with a topic. Maybe you go to LinkedIn, and you write
    “Packt acquisition editors” or “Manning acquisition editors”, and then you see
    some people and send them a connection request writing, “I'm interested in the
    writing a book about Comet,” or “I'm interested in writing a book about (some
    specific topic).” And then they might say, “Okay. You know what? Let's actually
    write it.” Right?
  sec: 2953
  time: '49:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, because the alternative (the official way) is to fill a form and send
    a proposal. But in this case, I think you have less chance to be accepted because
    you're one of the thousands of people who sent a book proposal. If you are sponsored
    by an acquisition editor instead, I think that you have a higher probability of
    being accepted.
  sec: 2981
  time: '49:41'
  who: Angelica
- header: The process for writing a book
- line: It's not an easy process. I know that because I’ve also written a couple of
    books. I'm curious, how did it actually happen? What was the process from the
    moment you got contacted by an acquisition editor, to the point when it was actually
    out in print?
  sec: 3019
  time: '50:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was a long journey.
  sec: 3040
  time: '50:40'
  who: Angelica
- line: I know. [laughs] It's very long. Too long.
  sec: 3042
  time: '50:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's another job. From this first book, I learned many things and I'd like
    to share them with you. The first thing is to read the contract carefully before
    signing it. I think that the first step is to read the particular timelines where
    the delivery process is defined. The publisher shares with you a possible timetable
    (timeline) where he says exactly when you have to deliver a chapter. Usually,
    due to time-to-market resources, the publisher expects a chapter every two weeks.
    I have done... [cross-talk]
  sec: 3044
  time: '50:44'
  who: Angelica
- line: That’s a very tight schedule.
  sec: 3101
  time: '51:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I have done this for the book Comet for Data Science, but I don't ever
    do this otherwise.
  sec: 3103
  time: '51:43'
  who: Angelica
- line: That’s like, “Okay, but when do I sleep?” [chuckles] Right? “When do I have
    a life?”
  sec: 3113
  time: '51:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. And so, if you can, ask the publisher to extend this period to at least
    four weeks per chapter. And if a chapter requires more time (maybe it requires
    a lot of coding and so on) also ask them for six weeks. I think that you should
    also add a holiday period – a vacation period – because the contract has a section
    where you can insert this aspect.
  sec: 3119
  time: '51:59'
  who: Angelica
- line: Then, when everything is okay for you, you can start writing – assuming that
    you already have a table of contents and so on (a list of chapters). If you have
    to write a chapter every four weeks, in practice, you need to write a page a day.
    You have 28 days for each chapter. If you remove weekends, maybe you have 20 days.
    You can write a chapter of 20 pages only by approaching one page per day, which
    is very easy.
  sec: 3119
  time: '51:59'
  who: Angelica
- line: Even before that – even before you have a contract (the contract and the timeline
    that you mentioned) – you need to actually feel the timeline. You need to know
    what the milestones are. “What are the chapters? What are the sections?” I guess
    there is also a lot of work before the contract. I don't know how it happened
    with you, but I guess these acquisition managers come in with a title and say,
    “Okay, I have these titles. Which of them was interesting for you?” And then you
    need to actually work out a proposal. Right? How does it happen?
  sec: 3212
  time: '53:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Firstly, you need to download the publisher’s template and you have to fill
    it. But the main question you have to ask (and you have to tell the truth when
    answering this question) “Do I know the topic?” Because if you don't know the
    topic, at least in general, don't write the book.
  sec: 3257
  time: '54:17'
  who: Angelica
- line: '[laughs] That’s a valid point. I was kind of under the assumption that if
    you want to write a book, then you know it. [chuckles]'
  sec: 3284
  time: '54:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles ]It could be that you don''t know the topic because maybe you’re
    working on machine learning and you want to write something about TensorFlow,
    for example. But if you don''t work with TensorFlow, don''t write a book on TensorFlow.
    At least, you must know an overall overview of the topic.'
  sec: 3292
  time: '54:52'
  who: Angelica
- line: Then, I think before writing everything, you need to search for other similar
    books. In the research field, this is called “the state of the art”. You need
    to see what is already available in the market. Because if your book doesn’t add
    anything with respect to the previous books, there is no sense to write it. [cross-talk]
  sec: 3292
  time: '54:52'
  who: Angelica
- line: It’s called market research, right?
  sec: 3353
  time: '55:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 3355
  time: '55:55'
  who: Angelica
- line: It could be. I think I came across this. I don't know what publishers call
    it. Your point is that the book should be unique in at least one aspect, right?
    [Angelica agrees] It shouldn't be just a copy of another book when it comes to
    the table of contents.
  sec: 3357
  time: '55:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Then once you have the topic, you have to think about the audience of your
    book. This is similar to the previous… [coughs]
  sec: 3375
  time: '56:15'
  who: Angelica
- line: Yeah, maybe take a moment.
  sec: 3396
  time: '56:36'
  who: Alexey
- header: Brainstorming
- line: Okay, sorry. You have to think about the audience and then I think you can
    start writing on paper everything about this topic. Everything that comes to your
    mind – it’s the brainstorming phase, where do you decide what to include and what
    not to include in your book.
  sec: 3407
  time: '56:47'
  who: Angelica
- line: I think what I did was create a mind map. You take a blank page and in the
    center I put the topic like, for example, “machine learning engineering”. Then
    there could be branches like “Okay, what can I talk about when it comes to this
    topic? I can talk about machine learning, I can talk about engineering,” and then
    I kind of branched out from each of these things. Then you convert that into a
    proposal eventually.
  sec: 3436
  time: '57:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Then I think that you can group the similar topics that you have found
    into macro areas. For example, if you have found 40 arguments, you can group them
    into 10-12 macro areas and this will become the chapter of your book. This is
    a general process. To tell the truth, I didn't follow this step. For the book
    Comet for Data Science, I had everything clearly in my mind. I said “I start saying
    this, then this, then this, and finally this.” [chuckles] The editor slightly
    changed something, but they accepted the proposal as it was.
  sec: 3467
  time: '57:47'
  who: Angelica
- line: So you have this proposal. You work for some time on the proposal and then
    the result (the proposal) is basically the table of contents, right? You have
    what the sections are, what the chapters are, and then I think you also describe
    the target audience.
  sec: 3531
  time: '58:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Also for some publishers, you also have to provide the state of the art
    (similar works) and the potential audience. But you must be very specific in regards
    to the audience. For example, you must say if the audience's entry-level or intermediate
    engineering, if there are some requirements for the audience. Because an entry
    level book is simpler – you talk about the basics and so on. But for an intermediate
    level, you have to know the topic very well because you assume that the audience
    already knows some things.
  sec: 3547
  time: '59:07'
  who: Angelica
- header: Reviews and revisions
- line: So then there is a proposal, which is hopefully accepted by the publisher.
    Then you sign the contract, where you should watch out for the things you described
    – make sure it's manageable and that you have time to actually enjoy life, and
    sleep, and other things. Then, if it's one chapter per month, you need to write
    around one-two pages per day to finish it, right?
  sec: 3609
  time: '1:00:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, but the process is not as simple as it seems. Because when you submit
    the first chapter, you write the second chapter, but after, for example, two weeks,
    you get the first chapter back with reviews. Firstly, you get notes back from
    your editor to change some editing aspects and then from reviewers. If you wrote
    quite well, this is easy, because the reviewer simply says “Okay.” But if you
    made some mistakes, then you need to work on chapter one and chapter two. This
    process overlaps with all the chapters.
  sec: 3638
  time: '1:00:38'
  who: Angelica
- line: I can see how it can snowball. Like when you write chapter four, you still
    have some unfinished comments from chapter one, then chapter two, and then you
    go mad.
  sec: 3704
  time: '1:01:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, but the idea is to keep yourself organized. I think that if you leave
    at least half an hour per day or one hour per day, it could be sufficient to deliver
    everything in time. But one hour is the rule for the time.
  sec: 3661
  time: '1:01:01'
  who: Angelica
- header: Conclusion
- line: I just noticed that actually, we’ve run out of time. This is a very exciting
    topic and time flies.
  sec: 3743
  time: '1:02:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe a very quick question before we finish. There is a question from Funkan.
    The question is, “Can a very routine 200-stroke article on, (for example, Italy's
    inflation rate in November 2022)  be considered data journalism? Or is it more
    like a report?”
  sec: 3751
  time: '1:02:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I didn't get the point? Stroke?
  sec: 3772
  time: '1:02:52'
  who: Angelica
- line: “200 stroke” I think 200 pages maybe? A report from Reuters on Italy's inflation
    rate in November 2022. Can this be considered data journalism? Are you familiar
    with Reuters? I think they are some sort of publication.
  sec: 3776
  time: '1:02:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, I don't. So I don't know the topic. Maybe I can investigate this
    and give a better answer.
  sec: 3797
  time: '1:03:17'
  who: Angelica
- line: Maybe we can find this article, share it with you and then you can answer
    in the notes. [Angelica agrees] It will be published in a couple of weeks anyways.
    Okay. It was fun talking to you. Thanks for joining us today. Thanks, everyone,
    for asking questions. I think we can wrap it up. Everyone, enjoy your weekend.
