- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: 'Guest Intro: Mariano Semelman, Head of Data Science at OLX'
- line: This week, we'll talk about the role of data science manager. We have a special
    guest today, Mariano. Mariano is actually my colleague and works as head of data
    science at OLX group. I think Mariano joined quite a while before me. You've been
    with OLX for five years, right?
  sec: 86
  time: '1:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, almost five.
  sec: 105
  time: '1:45'
  who: Mariano
- line: When I joined OLX, Mariano was a senior data scientist, then I saw him transition
    into a manager. Then after that, he became the head of data science. Mariano has
    13 years of experience, almost 10 of them were in data science. He's originally
    from Argentina and then moved to Berlin. Now he lives in Barcelona. Also I have
    here in the notes “And he's obsessed with…” And then it's unfinished. [laughs]
    So I don't know what you’re obsessed with.
  sec: 108
  time: '1:48'
  who: Alexey
- header: Passion for Product Applications in Data Science
- line: With product applications. Yes. I am obsessed with the application of data
    science. That's the area that I enjoy the most.
  sec: 140
  time: '2:20'
  who: Mariano
- line: Okay. Welcome to our event, Mariano.
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you, Alexey, for having me. I think it's going to be strange because
    I know you. Thank you so much for having me. It's an honor for me. I think you're
    doing a great job with DataTalks.Clubs. I think it was the anniversary very recently,
    so congrats on that. I'm all yours. You're the driver now.
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Mariano
- header: 'Career Journey: Software Dev to Data Science Leadership'
- line: Yeah, indeed. Actually, I wanted to get somebody on the DataTalks.Club podcast
    to talk about the experience of transitioning from an individual contributor role
    to a managerial role, and I couldn't think of anyone better for this conversation
    than you, Mariano. But before we go into our main topic of becoming a data science
    manager, I wanted to ask you about your background. Can you tell us about your
    career journey so far?
  sec: 179
  time: '2:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I'm a computer scientist and went to university for this subject. I
    did a Master’s back in Buenos Aires a long time ago – more years than I would
    like to say. But I was already working as a software developer, more or less,
    at the same time that I was doing college. I started working first as a data analyst,
    then as a Java developer, web developer. I even took a shot at mobile games. Data
    was my passion and within my Master’s, and I focused a lot on that and ever since.
  sec: 207
  time: '3:27'
  who: Mariano
- line: That's how I jumped into applications of data science in the industry. Mostly
    because I found it more attractive to work with something where you could experiment
    very often, and if you made mistakes, it’s not so good. The targets were very
    clear and we had checklists. I found it very assuring. Then, I changed companies
    twice, but I was always working in the area of data science – things around personalization,
    recommenders, marketing, segmentation, etc. It was always around ecommerce, you
    can say. Most of my experience is in ecommerce.
  sec: 207
  time: '3:27'
  who: Mariano
- line: Then I tried OLX almost five years ago and I had an amazing experience. I
    moved across three countries and worked with all types of people, cultures, projects,
    endeavors. It was super fun. So that's my summary. Please interrupt me, because
    you know me very well – I can go for hours without actually talking about anything,
    so. [laughs]
  sec: 207
  time: '3:27'
  who: Mariano
- header: 'Daily Responsibilities: Meetings, Mentoring & Planning'
- line: '[laughs] I was thinking “Okay how am I going to stop you?” [laughs] I’m just
    joking. Tell us a bit more about what you do as a manager. What does your day
    look like?'
  sec: 345
  time: '5:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Meetings. [laughs] Okay, not only meetings. There is a huge component of spending
    time with people nowadays. More than I would like to say. Lots of meetings. But
    it's mostly because they are required, not very necessary meetings. But you need
    to spend some time with people. Also working on reviews and planning of code projects
    – everything around project management. OLX is a very large company, so some of
    the time goes on writing a combination of reports and proposals – everything is
    very well documented. So some time goes on that. The largest component and one
    that I enjoy the most, is mentoring, coaching and people development – making
    sure that you help people keep growing and being the best professionals they can
    be or they want to be. I could go deeper but I think that summarizes it.
  sec: 361
  time: '6:01'
  who: Mariano
- line: That's quite a lot of responsibilities.
  sec: 444
  time: '7:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. It takes a bit of energy but it's good energy. It pays back. And I’m
    not talking about monetary gain, I'm talking about the everyday rewards and the
    satisfaction of doing it. It helps to do it.
  sec: 447
  time: '7:27'
  who: Mariano
- line: How large is your team? How many people do you manage?
  sec: 471
  time: '7:51'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Team Composition: Data Scientists and ML Engineers'
- line: It's always changing. I think when I started as a manager it was five, then
    seven at some point, then four. Now I think it's eight-nine people. They all have
    different seniority levels and roles. We have data scientists and machine learning
    engineers. We have junior, mid and senior levels in all the roles and each of
    them cover different topics and aspects that are collaborating with the rest of
    the company.
  sec: 474
  time: '7:54'
  who: Mariano
- header: 'Transition to Management: First Team of Five'
- line: You said when you became a data science manager, five people reported to you
    – you needed to manage five people. That's quite a drastic change from having
    zero people reporting to you.
  sec: 519
  time: '8:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I had some experience before that. Not experience that I would put on
    my resume, but I had some experience mentoring and project management with two
    people. It was ‘light level management’ because they were not reporting to me.
    Jumping to five was a stretch and I had to learn a lot. It was a lucky thing that
    I had many people to support, mentor, and guide me. I took an approach of presenting
    myself as somebody who was learning. I was doing my best to help and learn on
    the way together with everyone. By no means was I planning to make drastic decisions
    and things like that, without consulting someone first and discussing it with
    the team. At the time I was relying a lot on other people to do it. But it was
    good – I like that I got to work with them. During my first year, when I got my
    first experience, I was super lucky. Even though I didn't choose the team, I was
    super lucky with the people I got to work with, because they helped me. I helped
    them and they helped me to grow. They were very experienced data scientists. So
    it was a very good experience.
  sec: 535
  time: '8:55'
  who: Mariano
- line: Do you remember how it happened? I guess our manager came to you and said,
    “Hey, Mariano. What do you think about managing five people at once?” How did
    it happen with you?
  sec: 640
  time: '10:40'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Decision Mindset: Saying Yes and Learning on the Job'
- line: Very good question. At that point it was more like, “Are you interested in
    this? It will help the company a lot.” It was with my current manager, Andreas,
    who said “We need to start growing the team and have more people training.” It’s
    impossible after seven or eight people, it's super hard. It’s too much, because
    you’re already distributing your time across many people and the quality starts
    to drop. That's something you learn after a certain amount of people that you
    manage. It's very hard to give your all to them. Of course, with more experience
    you can do it better, but there is still a limit. So, it was like that. And I
    said, “Okay, let's try it.” At that point, I was having a lot of fun in the company.
    I still do, but at that point, I was super excited about absolutely everything.
    I was in the company for one year and I had just moved from Argentina to Berlin,
    and I said, “Yeah, let's do it.” Summer helped a lot. In summer, you feel much
    more energized. So yeah, I jumped in and said, “Yes, let’s do it.”
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Mariano
- line: So you agreed and then the next day, you woke up being a manager with five
    people reporting to you? What was the first thing you did when you found yourself
    managing a team?
  sec: 758
  time: '12:38'
  who: Alexey
- header: '30-60-90 Plan: Onboarding, Listening, and Learning'
- line: I think I got to know about it a few months in advance. Until it's announced
    and doesn’t actually happen, you don't know if it will happen. As soon as I knew
    that they wanted to put me in the position, I had one month or so to prepare myself.
    Luckily, I was on vacation as part of that. I was so excited and used, not a lot,
    but maybe one or two days of my vacation to write down my ideas and think about
    what will be my first few things that I will do – how will I structure my work.
    What I learned at that time was that there is this practice of the 30-60-90 days
    to write your plan. I'm not recommending to always stick to that, I’m just saying
    that it should be the way to do it. But it was a nice framework to follow and
    to structure your plan like “Okay, what I will do in the first 30 days, the first
    60 days?”
  sec: 772
  time: '12:52'
  who: Mariano
- line: In the first 30 days, I was meeting all of the people in the team, having
    one-on-ones with all of them. I started reading a lot about management tips. I
    didn't drown in it, but I was trying to see things here and there – things that
    I shouldn't forget – especially what to do from the technical point of view. Later,
    it was learning about all the projects they were working on. It didn't have to
    be super-detailed but I thought I understood enough to help them make decisions.
    They want somebody they could count on to make decisions.
  sec: 772
  time: '12:52'
  who: Mariano
- line: How did you organize that? Did you ask them to onboard you? Did you go through
    the code? What exactly did you do there? I don't know how many projects there
    were, but with five people, I imagine it was like three to five projects for you
    that you maybe didn't know about before that point.
  sec: 897
  time: '14:57'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Project Onboarding: Rapid Learning and Trusting Reports'
- line: Maybe more. It was people that were already in the company for some time,
    so all of them have at least one active project, plus one, two or maybe three
    that they have already put in production at some point, and were maybe maintaining
    them. It was a bit of everything. For some of them, I asked them to onboard me,
    maybe to spend one hour explaining things to me. I remember, Piotr, who is still
    in the company – I don't know how patient he was to explain everything about advertising.
    He threw stuff on the board and explained what they were doing. It was very, very
    challenging, because it certainly requires a lot of agility. I thought I was super
    fast, because I could jump into any project and learn it fast and do it. But sadly,
    I was onboarding on two, three, four projects at the same time. So I had to be
    super fast.
  sec: 916
  time: '15:16'
  who: Mariano
- line: An important thing to do was accept that you won't have all the information.
    Of course you also need to trust the people. They are the ones doing this, so
    if you have an idea, you should always start with the assumption that you may
    have a total misconception of how the application, or the project, that they’re
    working on, works. So may start your phrases with something like “Based on what
    I understood… because I think maybe this could work.” Maybe you're starting with
    very wrong assumptions, because while you’re learning things, you have very partial
    information. So for me that was important.
  sec: 916
  time: '15:16'
  who: Mariano
- line: Do you remember how many times you were wrong in your assumptions?
  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Alexey
- header: Embracing Wrong Assumptions to Trigger Discussion
- line: Many. Even up to this day, I'm usually more wrong than right. But I don't
    stop proposing because even if it's wrong, it triggers a discussion and I think
    it structures knowledge around the topic. I'm okay feeling stupid all the time
    as long as there is a flowing discussion and we think about all the problems together.
    Because when I ask a “stupid” question, the team will explain to me, “No, you're
    wrong, because it’s not that, it’s this.”
  sec: 1046
  time: '17:26'
  who: Mariano
- line: Then you learn about the project more, right?
  sec: 1092
  time: '18:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: I learn and based on that, they can think of an alternative solution. Also
    because I start with the wrong assumption, sometimes I bring a solution that’s
    out of the box. I think of something in a different structure and that triggers
    a process - they laugh, but then they look at the idea and say “If this were different,
    this will work. So what can we do to make it to that?” It's more like that. I'm
    not shy when it comes to seeming stupid in front of people that report to me.
    Something I always say is that data science is an area that everybody specializes
    so much. Everybody works in such specific domains. It would be super arrogant
    to say that you know everything you're working with.
  sec: 1095
  time: '18:15'
  who: Mariano
- line: I think that anybody who is a specialist in data science knows that they're
    specialists not because they know all of data science, but because they are able
    to learn new things and adapt. But there is no way to know everything. Being a
    manager actually gives you less knowledge, because now part of your time is not
    on the technical aspects, but the people and the processes. You have to pay attention
    to all those areas as well.
  sec: 1095
  time: '18:15'
  who: Mariano
- line: Did I understand correctly – I know before becoming a manager, you were a
    senior data scientist in the relevance team, so you were dealing with recommendations
    mostly, right?
  sec: 1186
  time: '19:46'
  who: Alexey
- header: Experience with Search and Recommender Systems
- line: Yeah. It was mostly everything around search and recommendations. At OLX,
    which is an online classifieds place where people come to buy stuff, so from the
    moment the user comes to buy, they have three ways to find things, more or less.
    Maybe a few more than three, but let's talk about the main ones. One is navigational
    – where they go through the categories and start applying filters. The other one
    is through the search bar, which is one of the areas where we do the most applications
    – around the search. And the other one is through recommendations – when they’re
    on the homepage, when they navigate and see “More like this”. Or even when you
    reach the end of the results for search, what we recommend so that you keep searching.
    These are more or less where I was strongly experienced in, at least for the last
    few years.
  sec: 1197
  time: '19:57'
  who: Mariano
- line: So the people you needed to manage were working on advertisement projects,
    right?
  sec: 1264
  time: '21:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, in a very specific area.
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Mariano
- line: It was about real time bidding and these types of things, right?
  sec: 1274
  time: '21:14'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Advertising Domain: Real-Time Bidding and Campaign Optimization'
- line: Kind of. It actually confused me a lot because I didn't know this thing beforehand,
    at least not in detail. That was my first “Aha!” moment, because I assumed it
    was the team that we were using to do publicity for OLX – to send traffic to OLX.
    But no, it actually was the team that managed the spaces we sold at OLX for third-party
    advertising on our platform, how to optimize the different areas. This involves
    things like how to do what's called “geo match,” how to personalize, and how to
    have better performance of the campaigns that are sold at OLX. That was really
    super new for me and I had to start doing a lot.
  sec: 1279
  time: '21:19'
  who: Mariano
- line: So you knew nothing about this domain, right?
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, not at all. Like they say in Spanish, I was with a parachute landing,
    you know? Improvising. If Pawel and Piotr are listening, my apologies. It was
    hard for me.
  sec: 1350

- line: Yes. Then it becomes a little bit of extrapolating the learnings you have
    as data scientists to other areas. Because some things are different, such as
    the domain, and maybe some of the models. Not all of them, but some of the models.
    But there are also things that don't change. The structure of a machine learning
    project, making sure that you correctly define the problem statement, what type
    of problem you have at hand. As a basic, is it regression or classification? But
    even later, things like – supervised/ unsupervised. But even inside those categories
    – what type of problem are you solving? What are the caveats? Because not everything
    falls into boxes automatically. Even if you want to say “Oh, this is such and
    such a problem.” Sometimes you can change the lens and it still works. So, this
    part is still the same.
  sec: 1389
  time: '23:09'
  who: Mariano
- line: Feature engineering also stays. Maybe a few new techniques here and there.
    Also, the whole evaluation and connecting to KPIs – the monitoring, the alerting,
    etc. There are many things which are common to any data science project. Also,
    how to drive the hypotheses. When you are dealing with a problem and you're stuck,
    and you need to improve. “Which hypotheses to rise? How to answer them? What things
    to check? How to prioritize work based on impact? How to drive analysis in order
    to decide what to test next?” Those things –that exercise – stays similar across
    projects. Of course, coming up with ideas and questions, it's always super hard.
    I'm not saying it's easy, but I'm saying that the process of which stage to watch,
    that helps. I always guide people in this direction. I think that should help
    them.

    structure projects, how to approach this, how to actually form the problem that
    you have in machine learning terms, and then measuring and all that. So it’s more
    about structuring your approach. Then you leave the domain knowledge and actual
    modeling to your subordinates.

- header: 'Diagnosing Model Issues: Overfitting, Data, and Features'
- line: Yes. For example, let's say that the end performance is not good enough. Then
    we must first figure out how to ask the right question. “Is it an overfitting
    problem? Not enough data? Model not strong enough? Is there a difference between
    test sets and production data?” I first help find answers to all these questions.
    Then once we identify the problem – let's say we are overfitting. Then I help
    with all the ideas around overfitting, all the tools we have at hand to fight
    overfitting depending on the model, of course – undersample/oversample, regularization,
    etc. Even feature engineering sometimes, or getting more features – things like
    that always help.
  sec: 1576
  time: '26:16'
  who: Mariano
- line: Or let’s say the model is not strong enough, or the model is not learning,
    “Okay, what data can we think of?” Think about the domain. Sometimes it's better
    not to think from the model point of view, but think, “Okay, if I'm the person
    that needs to decide whatever.” Because I always say machine learning is an automatic
    decision system. At least in the way we apply it – state the problem, apply automatic
    decision systems. I wouldn't put this in a book – it's an oversimplification.
    But if that machine has to make a decision, what extra data can you provide? What
    extra piece of information are you going to add to help that decision? For that,
    you need to think a little bit like, “Okay, if I wasn’t working at OLX, and I
    needed to ask for information about something to make a decision, what information
    would I look for to make that decision?”
  sec: 1576
  time: '26:16'
  who: Mariano
- line: Then we can take out the domain – “How to model that? How to get the data?”
    Because that's always super hard. Then the other part that I also help in a lot
    is navigating the organization. That's the part that is not so much data science,
    but it's more of a soft skill or a people skill. So you're working on this problem
    and you need this amount of data to integrate to this system or figure out how
    this part of the system works. So you have to make the connection and make the
    conversations happen. In the real world, things are not always super perfectly
    documented, or it’s not perfectly clear how things work in a company as big as
    this one. Sometimes it's challenging.

    is quite important. Sometimes data scientists, as I remember myself, tend to work
    on things that do not necessarily make a user impact. They're just fun to work
    on. But then product managers come with some ideas and you have to figure out
    how to connect these things.

    “key to success”, that would be the obsession with product applications. What
    I mean by that is – making sure that the data science solution is impacting the
    final user. That it’s helping someone – that somebody gets a benefit out of your
    work aside from just yourself. That somebody will receive this cool, almost magical
    thing that is data science and solve one of their problems that otherwise would
    be much more complex.

    I would have to go through all the pictures I have of my cat. It changes in your
    life, because now you can see a collection of that. Or even better, like all the
    pictures of my mom. Now I can see them all together and that's so nice. I like
    to see so many memories. Well, I want to achieve the same on paper. I want to
    create these “aha” moments, like “My life changed because of this.”Maybe not change,

    that drives me.
  sec: 1806

- line: Another thing that I put a lot of my mind to is, “What are the steps? How
    do you get from this to this?” Let's say I start with a data set and I’m optimising
    ROC AUC. And then all the work we do to start making an impact with this model.
    There is a huge gap between that. You have a pickle file or you have a TensorFlow
    model, and then what do you do with it? You're not gonna give it to the user.
    You cannot give a pickle file and expect them to ship it. So yes, you have to
    think about how to connect it. There are normally iterations of a product’s campaign.
    Experiments are one of the key words here – go and test your things quickly. Start
    with a very simple thing. If I can recommend one reading today, it would be –
    for me it’s very inspirational – “Rules of ML”. I think it's something Google

    who come with lots of ambition. I see myself in their place because I was also
    there. There’s the thing when you go to university, and they tell you “Now, the
    first year, you're not going to do programming.” You reply “But I came to study
    programming.” They say “No. In the first year you will be doing math.” So you
    say “But I’m a programmer.” Sometimes the project, when it starts, doesn't need
    the model – it needs everything around it. It needs getting the data, a good evaluation
    metric, a system to connect it to the user – a way to experiment, or maybe try
    it. A very simple and maybe poor pipeline, but something that you can run a few
    times right and reiterate. It's really not productionized but something that you
    can use.
  sec: 2016
  time: '33:36'
  who: Mariano
- line: You want to fail fast. You don’t want to spend too much time on it. The risk
    is too high. If you said “in 6 months” and we all think “No.” In any project where
    the product manager asks “How long is it going to take you?” And you think to
    yourself “I want to have a very good solution. It will take me two months.” No
    way it will take two months to finish something. If you think that you are going
    to work for two months, it's going to be six because you will just spend the first
    two on getting the data, modeling, and making a small demo. So it's better to
    start with the simplest model you can do and connect it to this and in the first
    two months, you will see even a drop – that's okay. Now, you can measure that
    drop.
  sec: 2016
  time: '33:36'
  who: Mariano

    baseline. You will be able to measure it. From modeling to testing in production,
    it won’t take you any time. You code, you work on your model, you test it. Is
    it a green light? Okay, green light to test. Then you go to test in production
    and you can decide then if you want to move forward or not. Then you have these
    incremental gains. I haven't read many books about Agile and data science. But

    old process – it’s like 20 years old or something like that. Surprisingly, it's
    still valid today. All these things like business understanding, then data understanding,
    then data preparation, then modeling, evaluation, and deployment. I think it's

    through the technical challenges of doing data science – you know how to code,
    how to model, you understand how to evaluate – you cover at least on the basics.
    There is always time to learn very complex modeling stuff. But whoever is doing
    data science will tell you in our company, the modeling part is no more than 5-10%
    of your time. Of course, I'm talking about a year average, maybe there is one
    full month that you're doing modeling. But all in all, you will be doing a lot
    of understanding the problem, getting the data, connecting it to production. That's
    the most time-demanding.
  sec: 2210
  time: '36:50'
  who: Mariano
- line: Once you get through this technical challenge, for me, the next thing is learning
    this. Because you spend so little time on doing the modeling part that you better
    spend it on the things that are going to be impactful. You have limited time to
    work on the model part where it shows. There are so many things to try. It's a
    very deep area – there are so many things to try and to experiment. Prioritizing
    the right thing to do at each point in time, for me, is what differentiates the
    good from the bad data scientists. There are many scientists that will know how
    to do each of the possible things you can do. They know how to model, they know
    all the possible layers, they know all the possible techniques for cross validation,
    hyper parameter tuning – they know end-to-end all the modeling parts. They have
    no problem with that.
  sec: 2210

  who: Mariano
- line: But then they struggle a lot on deciding what to do. Which part should I be
    prioritizing at some point in time? For me, here it goes back to identifying the
    problem. You start with the problem – what problem do you have? Then you do the
    experiment, you see what you saw in the experiment. Then you translate that. You
    bring it back all the way to – at which stage will you have the most impact on
    that problem? And you apply it there.

    stay focused on that, connecting it with the real problem. Then sometimes, I remember
    I was also in one of these projects where you would say “Okay. Hey, enough. Let's
    focus on actually integrating it with the product and then making sure that this
    is getting consumed and then iterating on that.” I think this is quite important
    that somebody tells you and then I think “Okay. Yeah. That's correct. I should
    try to wrap up and start iterating.” That's one of the things you're doing, right?

    entire team and you were doing a bit of reading. Then in the next month, this
    is the 60 part – midterm – you were trying to get onboarded and understand all
    the projects that the team was working on and also learn a bit about the domain

    remember. But here it is. In the third month, I did feedback. Because there was
    no point for me to give any type of feedback until spending at least one quarter
    there. I didn't give lots of feedback at that point. It wasn’t critical. I think
    everybody was working fine at that point. But I took the time to give back what
    I think was my opinion. But I delay that until the very last place, because I
    wanted to make sure that I have a full view of the situation before giving any
    type of feedback.

    managers, right? All the time I compared “What would I like in this?” I put a
    little bit of my personal touch. I treat people the way I would like to be treated.
    Because I don't know, it feels fair. Or even, of course, treating people better
    than I would like somebody to treat me. I don't like somebody coming in the first
    two months and telling me the things I did wrong. No because I'm not doing them,
    but it feels like somebody is judging you by the cover. You want to spend some
    more time – maybe 60 or 70 days are not enough. But I already felt after one quarter
    of working on projects, I've been able to do iterations, on working with OKRs,
    and seeing how the team performs, on how they were structuring the projects. At

    person is, and what the feedback is. But there are three parts of the communication.
    But I had good mentors. One of them told me that, especially when you're going
    to give feedback that you do not feel comfortable giving, the first thing you
    ask the person is if they are interested in receiving feedback. You have to start
    the conversation with “Are you interested in receiving feedback?” “Yes/No” Some
    people just don't like it or don't trust you, especially the very beginning. Later
    on, you build up trust. But at the beginning, maybe you have to ask.
  sec: 2657
  time: '44:17'
  who: Mariano
- line: Aside from asking, you have to care about that person. You're giving that
    feedback because you care about them. Because you think it will make them better
    or that will help them. That already puts you in a better position where they
    will listen to you. But you never give feedback like “This is what you have to
    do.” Except for very clear things like if somebody is behaving in a very unacceptable
    way. But that happens rarely. I think in over three years, I think I saw it just
    once. You don't have to really even think about it, you just have a one-on-one
    and say, “Don't do that.” That's the easiest feedback to give, when somebody does
    something that is unacceptable for a professional.
  sec: 2657
  time: '44:17'
  who: Mariano
- line: For giving tips or feedback on things that you think are harming that person’s
    progress, you should start saying that it's advice. It’s something that you feel
    could help them. You say that may be wrong. Just because you're a manager and
    you're giving feedback, it doesn't make you right. When you start like that, at
    least for me, I say it because I feel that way. I’m giving them my opinion on
    what I think. Of course, I won't lie to you – the opinion of your manager also
    impacts your professional career. It's impossible to deny it. That’s how things
    flow, unfortunately. But that’s not the main point – you do it from the point
    of view that you care, and you open the possibility that you may be wrong with
    the feedback. You give them the space to think about it, and to see if they reflect
    on that – if they think the same – and if you think it will help them. Maybe too
    generic, maybe we can do an exercise and give it with a concrete example. I don’t
    know if it's the objective of today.

    topic to discuss. But there is always something to talk about, even more with
    remote setups. Even just to say “hi” and see how the person is doing. People go

    It has to be a place that in some way feels like a game right? It's not a game,
    but I mean – suppose you can make mistakes and they are not so harmful. In your
    personal life, making mistakes is much more harmful. While at work, you can always
    change your work or change the theme or start from scratch and change the project.
    Making mistakes at work is a safe place to do it and it should be, plus learning

    be on the critical path of any project. No project should depend on your work.
    Your role as a manager is unblocking, facilitating and making sure that every
    project is on time and people can work easily. So, if you say “No, I will work
    on the most important parts of the project, step aside, wait for me.” You will

    but to be super sure that that person will do well. Even at the expense of having
    longer interviewing processes and losing candidates because they're accepting
    other offers somewhere else and you took longer, than to be in a situation where
    you’ve got a bad hire. Because you lose more time hiring somebody and onboarding,
    and then realizing they're not working, than having to interview the total amount
    of people.

    probation period in the country is. Every country has a different probation period.
    But let's say if it's Germany, which has a six months probation period, which
    is huge. If you have such a long probation period, then at three months, you can
    already do an evaluation. At that point in time, that’s what you can do if you
    think it's not working. Or even if you think it's working. But if you think it's
    not working, you say, “I think it's not working because this, this, this. I think
    you're not on time. You call this off, etc. It’s not working.” For the people
    that are performing, you also give them “You're doing fine.” People are already
    stressed on the probation period, so it's good to give them reassurance if you
    think you're doing fine. There is no point in people feeling without confidence
    if they're doing fine.
  sec: 3348
  time: '55:48'
  who: Mariano
- line: If it's a shorter period, then make sure to do an evaluation like one month
    before. And don’t just give feedback, but also do what we call at our company
    “a development plan” – other companies have similar things. “These are the things
    we think you're not doing well,” I say as a manager, “You can improve them by
    doing this.” So you give them some suggestions. Not things that they have to do,
    because everybody learns in a different way. Some people prefer courses, some
    people prefer hands-on, some people prefer a mix or being mentored, somebody teaching
    them. But at least it's not just saying what's not working – it’s also giving
    them some possible path, and opening the doors for them to figure things out.
    You can think about it together regarding how to improve on those things.
  sec: 3348
  time: '55:48'
  who: Mariano
- line: If there are signs of improvement and you're willing to wait, then the person
    can keep improving. But if there are no signs of improvement after the probation
    period, then you have to stop the relationship, unfortunately. It's best for both
    parties. It's not only good for the company, but it's also good for the person
    because, otherwise, they will stay in a situation where they are always underperforming
    and they will end up with a stigma. They're always with a stigma of being the
    one that doesn't perform. They cannot grow in the company easily later on because
    there was a stigma that you started out super bad.
  sec: 3348
  time: '55:48'
  who: Mariano
- line: If it's much later than the probation period, that's even trickier and takes
    longer. Of course, I always say it's very important to give people the opportunity
    – you have to give this development plan and work with them, spend some time.
    It's the kind of situation that demands the most amount of work, in comparison
    to the results, obviously. But it's gratifying in the end. When people react to
    that and start working, it's quite gratifying. It's a good situation. Not everybody
    is super performing all the time. It will happen at some point of your career
    that you are under the expectations. So it's good to have a heads up and somebody
    to hold your hand for a bit and show you the path. I think that's good to have
    a manager doing that.

- line: Yes. Good question. Well, I was asked this question in the past. For me, there
    is no recipe. It’s something I have greatly internalized, because I learned it
    the hard way. Except when you're working at big companies, the Microsoft, Google,
    Facebook, Apple of the world, right? Or if you’re working on something very niche
    or very AI specific, – like an AI-centric company. I don't try things that have
    not been proven before. It's not that it has to be exactly like something that
    somebody already did before, but I usually try things that certain conditions
    don't allow. But I usually like trying things that some other company in a similar
    domain have tried in the past.

- line: Something I really like to follow very closely is what other companies are
    doing with their data science team – what's working, what's not working for them?
    Whenever I see that they're using something new that they were not using before,
    that I am not aware of – then I want to study it. I’m also particularly interested
    in NLP. I really like it. Whenever there is something new, like ELMO at the time
    now BERT and transformers, or other pre-trained things. I try to say, I'm not
    cutting edge. To be honest, I don't need to be. For the modeling part, I'm not
    cutting edge. But for me it really pays off to be more cutting edge, or being
    on the latest developments, around the engineering point of view of data science.
    That way I think where we're delayed, as far as I know. Our trade – the world
    of data science – is past due at least five years with practices. As a profession,
    it grew super fast. We now probably have 10x the amount of data scientists now
    then what we had five years ago. The practices that work in such large teams across
    the company are adapting all the time because it's something new to work with
    so many data scientists. So that's the only thing I keep super up to date with
    – what we call ML Ops, maybe? I think we have talked about this a few times with
    Alexey.
  sec: 3697
  time: '1:01:37'
  who: Mariano
- line: Yes, we discussed “What is ML Ops? What is not?” But basically it’s productionizing
    in machine learning, right? Also all the processes and how people communicate,
    what the process looks like, what the tools that we need to use are.
  sec: 3877
  time: '1:04:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly – the systems around the processes and how they all shape each
    other. How the systems support the processes to make it easy. We know that things
    are simple to use, but at the same time they help you and they help you with a
    process – they make an efficient process, but they are not a pain in the ass.
    I am very allergic to bureaucracy. When the process takes you more time than the
    thing you're actually doing. For me, it's not work.

    what I had in mind. So yeah, thanks a lot for joining us today. Thanks a lot for
    sharing your story with us, for sharing your experience. Also, this 30-60-90 thing,
    I think it’s useful. Actually, I've talked to you before I became a manager and
    did that thing as well, when I was doing the transition. So thanks a lot. And
    thanks, everyone, for joining us today, for asking questions. I should have started
    asking questions because we still have a couple of left. But maybe we will keep
    them for some other time.

    My LinkedIn ID is M Semelman. You can find it like that. I think we were talking

    and unlucky to have a very strange name.
