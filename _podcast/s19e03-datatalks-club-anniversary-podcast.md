- header: DataTalks.Club anniversary "Ask Me Anything" event with Alexey Grigorev
- line: Hi, everyone. Welcome to our event. This event is brought to you by DataTalks.Club,
    a community for people who love data. We have weekly events, but today is a special
    one because this is not our usual Thursday event. Today is our anniversary "Ask
    Me Anything" podcast, and Johanna will be asking me questions a bit later. Right
    now, I’ll just go through our usual slides. DataTalks.Club has turned four, so
    thank you all for being with us, and a special thanks to Johanna for being part
    of the podcast for so long. It’s really amazing.

  who: Alexey
- line: Today, we have a special host, Johanna, who is the mastermind behind all of
    the podcast episodes. I know you’ve been doing this for almost three years.
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, almost three years now, maybe around 2.5. I thought about it recently.
    And fun fact, I just got my official DataTalks.Club email address. I’m officially
    "in" now!
  sec: 95
  time: '1:35'
  who: Johanna
- line: So, welcome everyone! I see some familiar faces on YouTube. The idea for this
    podcast is similar to what we did last year. We’re turning the tables, and Alexey
    will be in the guest seat this time. I’ll give you all the opportunity to ask
    him questions. But first, I’ll ask the guest to introduce himself — just keep
    it short, please!
  sec: 95
  time: '1:35'
  who: Johanna
- header: The founding of DataTalks.Club
- line: Hi, everyone. My name is Alexey, or Alexei. In Russian, it's actually "Alexei,"
    but when I was in the U.S. for the first time, people started calling me Alexey,
    and I got used to it. You can call me whatever you want. I started DataTalks.Club
    four years ago by accident. I remember it was September 19, 2020, when everyone
    thought COVID was over, but it wasn’t. That summer, we all relaxed, thinking we
    could travel again. I remember going to the seaside in Germany, but by September,
    restrictions were back, and we were stuck at home. That’s when I thought, “Maybe
    I should start something.” And that’s how DataTalks.Club began.
  sec: 149
  time: '2:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's been four years now, and I’m really grateful to everyone who’s been involved.
    I’ve talked to so many amazing people over the years. I didn’t prepare for this
    introduction, so I’m not sure what else to say!
  sec: 149
  time: '2:29'
  who: Alexey
- header: Alexey's transition from Java work to DataTalks.Club
- line: That’s great! Most people probably know you anyway. Before DataTalks.Club,
    you were doing mostly Java work, right? And now you’re full-time with DataTalks.Club?
  sec: 232
  time: '3:52'
  who: Johanna
- line: 'Yes, I was a data scientist at Helix. In April 2023, more than a year ago,
    I decided to focus on just one thing: DataTalks.Club. Before that, I was essentially
    doing two full-time jobs — both demanding jobs that required a lot of attention.
    It became impossible to give both the time they deserved. So, I decided to focus
    on DataTalks.Club, especially since it had become profitable. I did the math and
    figured out that the income from DataTalks.Club would be enough to cover living
    costs in Berlin, which, to be honest, isn’t cheap!'
  sec: 246
  time: '4:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, Berlin definitely hasn’t gotten any cheaper!
  sec: 293
  time: '4:53'
  who: Johanna
- line: Exactly. It’s only getting more expensive.
  sec: 297
  time: '4:57'
  who: Alexey
- header: Growth and success of DataTalks.Club courses
- line: So, how has the year been for you since we last talked?
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Johanna
- line: 'It’s been a really good year. We got two new sponsors, and our courses are
    doing well. Our Data Engineering course, in particular, has been very successful.
    Maybe I should give some background on the courses. We currently have five: Machine
    Learning Zoomcamp, Data Engineering Zoomcamp, and MLOps Zoomcamp were the ones
    we talked about last time. Since then, we’ve added two more: one on large language
    models (LLMs) and another on stock market analytics.'
  sec: 307
  time: '5:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: The Data Engineering Zoomcamp has grown unexpectedly popular. We almost don’t
    promote it — people just recommend it to each other. It’s our most popular course,
    with 24,000 registrations! For comparison, our machine learning course has 8,000
    registrations, which is already a big number. It’s been amazing to see how the
    course has taken off.
  sec: 307
  time: '5:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: We also launched the LLM course because, well, everyone was asking for it.
    And the stock market analytics course was a bit different for us since we usually
    focus on engineering topics. But it was still well received, and it was interesting
    because I wasn’t involved in teaching it. Ivan, the lead instructor, took full
    control. That was a new experiment for us — running a course without my direct
    involvement — and it worked well.
  sec: 307
  time: '5:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: So, those were the big highlights this year.
  sec: 307
  time: '5:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, regarding the non-promotion, I think the courses are set up in a way
    that encourages people to talk about them. People are basically promoting the
    courses for you!
  sec: 493
  time: '8:13'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah, even outside of the cohorts. For example, when someone on Reddit asks
    for a data engineering course recommendation, people suggest ours. They’re not
    even getting any incentives for that — unlike during the course when we give out
    virtual points. It’s really cool to see that happening organically.
  sec: 510
  time: '8:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it’s great! So, what’s been the most surprising or fun thing you’ve
    learned this year while running the community? Anything come to mind? Last year,
    we talked about people trying to date each other in the community.
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Johanna
- line: Haha, yeah, that was funny. Maybe it’s still happening, but I don’t hear about
    it much anymore. What I have noticed is an increase in scams lately. For example,
    there’s something called the "Upwork scam." People will message you, asking you
    to create an Upwork account so they can use it to work on your behalf. They offer
    to split the earnings with you, but this is illegal and can have serious consequences.
  sec: 562
  time: '9:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Many communities are dealing with this issue, so if you receive a suspicious
    message, please report it. And if someone randomly DMs you in the community, that’s
    usually a red flag. We encourage people to use public channels unless there’s
    a valid reason for a direct message. If someone is trying to promote something
    or is asking for your Upwork account, definitely let us know.
  sec: 562
  time: '9:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Of course, if someone is asking you out on a date... well, maybe use your
    judgment! But remember, this is a professional community, not a dating site.
  sec: 562
  time: '9:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Yeah, I didn’t know about the Upwork scam. That’s really good to know. Alright,
    let’s take some questions from the community. Here’s one: "Why did you decide
    to create a free-to-learn community? What keeps you motivated, and have you ever
    thought about stopping or leaving the community?"'
  sec: 694
  time: '11:34'
  who: Johanna
- header: Motivation behind creating a free-to-learn community
- line: This one question? Well, luckily I have it open in front of me too. So, why
    did you choose to create a free-to-learn community?
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Johanna
- line: Alexey
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Johanna
- line: There are many reasons, but one of them is that I benefited a lot from free
    courses when I was starting my career in data science. So, this is my way of giving
    back to the community. Coursera, for example, used to have free courses — I'm
    not sure if they do anymore. Apart from Coursera, I was part of a community called
    Open Data Science, which was a Russian-speaking community based in Moscow. It
    doesn’t exist anymore because most of the workspaces in Russia have closed.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Johanna
- line: Surprisingly, though, many people still associate with this community. For
    example, there’s a Telegram group called ODS Berlin, one in Munich, and one in
    Paris. Even though the community itself doesn't exist, it fragmented and decentralized,
    which is a good example of a real community where things happen organically. Even
    after the community stopped existing, people continued to self-organize and do
    more.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Johanna
- line: Open Data Science ran a course called ML course, which was a community effort.
    Around five or six people came together to create it, and it was free. I loved
    the idea of openness and offering free learning. That course was amazing. It inspired
    me to do something similar, but in English. When I had the chance, I finally decided
    to do this and created the Machine Learning Zoomcamp. That course was successful,
    but it was just me as the instructor, which made it hard.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Johanna
- line: One of the students from that course, Ankush, reached out and suggested creating
    a data engineering course. Together with two other community members, Sejal and
    Victoria, we put together a course, with each of us covering one or two modules.
    It was very similar to the ML course. The idea was to offer it for free from the
    start, and it has grown to be much bigger than I expected.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Johanna
- line: What keeps me going is the feedback I get from the community. I believe in
    free education, and it’s really motivating when people from countries like Nigeria
    ask if they can complete the course on a tablet. The answer is yes! Knowing that
    we’re providing education to people who can’t afford paid courses is inspiring.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Johanna
- line: That’s true.
  sec: 985
  time: '16:25'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah. And when someone tells me that my course changed their life, that’s
    the best part. Some people find jobs afterward and send me a message about how
    their life has changed. One student even decided to donate to DataTalks.Club after
    getting a job with a training budget.
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Johanna
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s so cool.
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Alexey
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it wasn’t a lot compared to what sponsors give us — 500 euros — but
    it felt so much more meaningful. The sad part is that we had to pay taxes, so
    half of it went to taxes, but that’s life in Germany.
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Johanna
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, taxes! But you’ve got such a huge community now, with around 100,000
    people signed up for your newsletter. That’s insane!
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: There was a question about whether I’ve ever thought about stopping. It might
    happen. When I left my previous job to focus on DataTalks.Club, it coincided with
    the recession, and many sponsors canceled. I was expecting a certain amount of
    money, but sponsors pulled out, cutting their marketing budgets.
  sec: 1076
  time: '17:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: At one point, I was losing two or three thousand euros a month after leaving
    my job. It made me wonder if I made the right decision. Thankfully, it worked
    out, but I never know what will happen. If the money stops coming in, I’ll have
    to find another way to earn, which would mean I couldn’t focus entirely on the
    community. Having two jobs, like when I worked at OLX, was tough.
  sec: 1076
  time: '17:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Today, I had two calls with potential sponsors. Sometimes, I think it's going
    well, but then they stop replying. But right now, I’m optimistic. We have enough
    runway for the rest of the year and a bit of next year. The Data Engineering Zoomcamp
    will continue, and we might even start a new course.
  sec: 1076
  time: '17:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Wow. You also mentioned taxes. You had to pay a lot of taxes in advance?
  sec: 1214
  time: '20:14'
  who: Johanna
- line: Alexey
  sec: 1214
  time: '20:14'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yes, in Germany, we have this concept of prepaid taxes. The tax office calculates
    your expected income based on the first few months of the year. What happened
    to me last year is they took my income from the first three months, multiplied
    it by four, and told me to pay 50% of that each quarter. But it wasn’t accurately
    calculated.
  sec: 1214
  time: '20:14'
  who: Johanna
- line: The tax office was basically taking all the money I earned. They canceled
    the last quarter payment, and in the end, they even refunded some money because
    they had been overly optimistic in their calculations. This year isn’t as bad
    since they used last year’s profit for their estimate, but it’s still frustrating
    to wake up and see that half your money is gone because of taxes. I gave them
    permission to take the money automatically to avoid forgetting to pay, but it’s
    tough.
  sec: 1214
  time: '20:14'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah, taxes are so much fun!
  sec: 1331
  time: '22:11'
  who: Johanna
- line: In Germany, it may not be the best place for business, but I see where the
    taxes go. The roads are maintained, my child attends school for free, and the
    food there is organic and free as well. I received an education in Germany for
    about 300 per semester.
  sec: 1333
  time: '22:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: With the influx of Ukrainians in Germany, the country has invested significantly
    in upskilling them. Many who arrived two years ago are now working and contributing
    back to the government through taxes.
  sec: 1368
  time: '22:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm pleased to see that this money is not just going into someone's pockets
    but is being reinvested into society. I may not know the whole story, but from
    what I observe, I am happy.
  sec: 1368
  time: '22:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't want to delve too much into politics, but the current situation in
    Germany appears promising.
  sec: 1368
  time: '22:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'But that''s the state of the world at the moment. Can we return to some of
    the questions? One is: Are you still active in machine learning or data science,
    working on projects aside from the course? How do you stay relevant and up to
    date?'
  sec: 1418
  time: '23:38'
  who: Johanna
- header: Staying updated in data science through pet projects
- line: That's a good question. It's quite challenging. I have pet projects, which
    is how I try to stay updated. However, pet projects are not the same as working
    on real products. I still acquire some skills, but it's different from when I
    worked at Alix, where my fraud detection system was used on millions of items
    daily.
  sec: 1443
  time: '24:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's nowhere close to that level, but I still do my best. One recent pet project
    involved generating horror stories. My son loves horror stories and often asks
    me to tell him one about something random, like a tree or a construction site.
  sec: 1443
  time: '24:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s tough to come up with so many horror stories on the spot. So, I decided
    to take a picture of whatever he pointed to, input it into GPT, and have it generate
    a horror story. The results were incredibly good. The stories were so impressive
    that I thought it would be a shame to keep them on my phone.
  sec: 1443
  time: '24:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Initially, I put the stories on a small GitHub Pages website. Then, I thought
    it would be nice to have illustrations for them. I used DALL·E to generate the
    illustrations, and I even implemented text-to-speech functionality. Instead of
    reading the stories myself, a voice could narrate them.
  sec: 1443
  time: '24:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Eventually, I automated the entire process. I take a picture, upload it to
    an S3 bucket, and I can upload as many pictures as I want. Periodically, a GitHub
    Action pulls one of the images, creates a story based on it, generates an illustration,
    produces an audio file, and publishes it as a podcast.
  sec: 1443
  time: '24:03'
  who: Alexey
- header: Hosting a second podcast and maintaining programming skills
- line: Wow, that's amazing. So, you're basically hosting a second podcast now.
  sec: 1597
  time: '26:37'
  who: Johanna
- line: Let's see how popular it becomes. Maybe I'll stop working with people. But
    all of this is open source; you can find it on my GitHub. Even though the content
    is in Russian, the code is in Python, so don't worry.
  sec: 1603
  time: '26:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: I try to do things like that to stay updated. For example, the LM course required
    some preparation and research. I also created an example project about gym exercises.
    If someone wanted to replace a specific exercise, they could chat with the system
    and ask for a suitable alternative.
  sec: 1603
  time: '26:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: That was another cool project. I also try to maintain my programming skills
    by working on various things, from simple automation scripts to larger projects.
    For instance, we currently have a course management platform written in Django.
    While it doesn't involve AI or machine learning, I spend time on it to keep my
    coding skills sharp.
  sec: 1603
  time: '26:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Last year, I was in a managerial role at Alix, and DataTalks.Club wasn’t a
    place where I wrote code. Over time, I realized my coding skills were not as sharp
    anymore. Now, I force myself to do different things to remember how to program.
  sec: 1603
  time: '26:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: Skepticism about LLMs and their relevance
- line: That's a common experience for someone who moves up the ladder, right? It
    happens to everyone.
  sec: 1736
  time: '28:56'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yes, exactly. I was skeptical about the LLM course at first. I thought LLMs
    were just another trend like Web 3.0 or Blockchain — something everyone talks
    about for a month, and then it fades away.
  sec: 1754
  time: '29:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: I remember the first time I learned about GPT; someone asked it to write a
    poem about machine learning during one of our courses. It was actually good, which
    made me reconsider my skepticism.
  sec: 1754
  time: '29:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: As I saw more about LLMs last year, I thought it was time for us to get involved
    as well. I didn't work on LLM projects at Alix, but many concepts from my past
    experience still apply. For example, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) is a
    core component of R. I have been working with search technologies for over ten
    years, so I felt well-prepared to tackle these new developments.
  sec: 1754
  time: '29:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: The course went really well, and I’m happy with the outcome. I also learned
    many new things.
  sec: 1754
  time: '29:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Great! I had a similar introduction to LLMs. I tend to trust things only when
    I understand them. At first, I was skeptical, but after taking a university course
    on it, I found it super interesting. Transformers are fascinating, and I realized
    I could experiment with them myself. The course is still available, so people
    can check it out.
  sec: 1868
  time: '31:08'
  who: Johanna
- header: Transitioning to DataTalks.Club and personal reflections
- line: The next question is, you've been doing DataTalks.Club full-time for almost
    two years. How's life? Would you reverse your decision to leave corporate work
    or change anything?
  sec: 1913
  time: '31:53'
  who: Johanna
- line: I think we've partially answered that, but perhaps you can expand.
  sec: 1913
  time: '31:53'
  who: Johanna
- line: Actually, this question comes from a friend of mine. Life has been good; I
    wouldn't change anything. I have no regrets. There were tough times and incredibly
    good times, but I am happy with where I am now.
  sec: 1910
  time: '31:50'
  who: Johanna
- line: My only hope is that it continues. Some things are outside of my control,
    but if I need to find a job for any reason, I’m confident I can at least find
    a software engineering role where I can be useful.
  sec: 1910
  time: '31:50'
  who: Johanna
- line: I have no regrets about returning to corporate life. If I were to do that,
    it would likely be with a smaller company. I've also thought about what I would
    do if not at DataTalks.Club.
  sec: 1910
  time: '31:50'
  who: Johanna
- line: I see myself in a position where I can teach and code, combining both interests.
    I want to remain technical but also fulfill my passion for educating others.
  sec: 1910
  time: '31:50'
  who: Johanna
- header: Memorable moments and the first event's success
- line: Cool! What was a memorable moment early on when you knew this would take off?
  sec: 2012
  time: '33:32'
  who: Johanna
- line: It was during our first event, which was organized by a different Dimitry.
    Hi, Dimitry! Someone asked me about it on LinkedIn, and I shared the details in
    a form.
  sec: 2020
  time: '33:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: When we had our first event, I realized this could be something meaningful.
    Initially, while working at Alix, I had a clause in my contract stating I couldn't
    engage in side projects without explicit permission.
  sec: 2020
  time: '33:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first couple of months, I operated under the radar. I wasn't dedicating
    much time to it; I was just setting things up and seeing how they progressed.
  sec: 2020
  time: '33:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: I reached out to participants to understand their interests and goals. This
    way, I met many people who later became co-instructors, podcast guests, or friends.
  sec: 2020
  time: '33:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: One participant asked where they could speak, and I told him I knew of a suitable
    venue. Since I understood the audience's interests, his talk was relevant, attracting
    100 attendees.
  sec: 2020
  time: '33:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: At that moment, I realized this wasn’t just a side project; it was becoming
    something significant, prompting me to speak to my manager.
  sec: 2020
  time: '33:40'
  who: Alexey

- line: The birth of DataTalks coincided with the pandemic, right? Many communities
    were formed during that time. Why do you think DataTalks is still thriving while
    many other communities have faded?
  sec: 2179
  time: '36:19'
  who: Johanna
- line: I've consulted with many people about community building. There's a misconception
    that you can create a community, and it will sustain itself. This can happen,
    as seen with Open Data Science, which became a true community. Even after their
    main platform disappeared, the community remained intact.
  sec: 2197
  time: '36:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: However, many communities require active investment of time and effort. You
    need to keep it alive; otherwise, it will fade away.
  sec: 2197
  time: '36:37'
  who: Alexey

    to its decline.
  sec: 2197
  time: '36:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: I kept DataTalks alive because I gained so much from it. The positive feedback
    I received was incredibly rewarding, motivating me to continue. Every time someone
    expresses gratitude, saying the course is beneficial, it encourages me to keep
    going.

  sec: 2338
  time: '38:58'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yes.
  sec: 2340
  time: '39:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: What do you think about the possibility of AI replacing data analysts? In
    your opinion, what could be the next level for a data analyst? An ML engineer?
  sec: 2341
  time: '39:01'
  who: Johanna
- line: I think partly yes, for simple tasks. However, being an analyst involves much
    more than just using SQL to build dashboards. There's a component of talking to
    people and business domain expertise.
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: You could also argue that AI has replaced data scientists. You don't need
    an LLM to build a good machine learning model. Five or ten years ago, we had AutoML
    packages where you just needed to input a CSV file and get a reasonably good model.
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, in a Kaggle competition, if you upload a CSV file to Azure AutoML
    or Google AutoML, you will receive a decent result. Of course, you won't rank
    in the top ten without three months of work, but it can produce a model ready
    for production.
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: So why are data scientists still around? It indicates that the role involves
    more than simply taking a CSV file and training a model.
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't believe AI will replace data analysts, data scientists, or anyone
    who needs to use their intellect at work. AI can assist people rather than replace
    them. It's similar to how autopilot systems were introduced; pilots are still
    needed.
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Even now, I’m not sure how much involvement pilots have. Perhaps they just
    sit and watch the flight. Yet, there must be a reason for their continued presence.
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think the role of data analysts will become simpler. They won’t need to
    spend so much time writing complex SQL queries. They can delegate tasks like bug
    finding.
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: However, communication with the business is still crucial. Understanding which
    metrics to compute requires conversations with stakeholders about what matters
    to them. Metrics don’t just appear; they need to be defined through discussions.
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- header: Discussion on AI in healthcare
- line: Exactly. I'm more from the medical field, and I hear similar ideas about AI
    replacing doctors. However, people visit doctors for more than just a diagnosis;
    they want someone to talk to.
  sec: 2544
  time: '42:24'
  who: Johanna
- line: Would people prefer to talk to AI? Maybe it's just a German thing, but sometimes
    I feel worse after going to a doctor.
  sec: 2559
  time: '42:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: That could actually be an improvement.
  sec: 2573
  time: '42:53'
  who: Johanna
- line: Sometimes, yes. For instance, there was a time when my child started kindergarten
    and brought home various viruses. I was sick all the time. I asked the doctor
    what I could do, and he jokingly said to get rid of the kid.
  sec: 2577
  time: '42:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, yeah.
  sec: 2603
  time: '43:23'
  who: Johanna

    wouldn’t be as memorable.
  sec: 2606
  time: '43:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: I find it amusing that after years of medical school, that was the doctor's
    answer.
  sec: 2615
  time: '43:35'
  who: Johanna
- line: Later, he explained his reasoning, saying that children produce more viruses
    than adults. He noted that this is natural and unavoidable. Apart from “getting
    rid of the kid,” he advised me to drink less coffee, sleep more, and go to the
    gym — usual recommendations.

    interesting. You were born in 1989, right?

  sec: 2709
  time: '45:09'
  who: Johanna

    scaling the community? We’ve touched upon this, but maybe you can expand.
  sec: 2730
  time: '45:30'
  who: Johanna

    why I did it. It gave me meaning during COVID when my work wasn’t fulfilling.
  sec: 2744
  time: '45:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was already in a managerial role, and it required a lot of work, often without
    immediate returns. In the first year, I made around $500, if that, and it took
    about a year and a half before I saw any real income.
  sec: 2744
  time: '45:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: It took significant effort, and I didn’t initially consider scalability. I
    focused on what I could do to provide value and keep people engaged in the community.
    They continued to come back.
  sec: 2744
  time: '45:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Even before it was profitable, I received an offer from a company interested
    in acquiring the community. I decided against it because I feared that if it became
    my job, I’d lose my passion for it.
  sec: 2744

  sec: 2856

    mission? It can be isolating to create a community.

    We even had a community mastermind group with someone from Locally Optimistic,
    a community for data analysts, along with members from other communities.
  sec: 2882

  sec: 2882
  time: '48:02'
  who: Alexey

    be one reason I continued this journey — meeting new people and forming meaningful
    connections.
  sec: 2882

  who: Alexey

    you and everyone else. Developing these connections has been incredibly rewarding.

    beneficial. What would you like to achieve in the upcoming years? That’s a good
    question.
  sec: 2974
  time: '49:34'
  who: Johanna
- line: So, I need more sponsors. That’s what I want to do. I’m looking to do more
    courses. We have this course platform, and I mentioned the one I did in Django.
    Previously, it was a lot of manual work — lots of Python scripts and Google Forms,
    which required a lot of effort to run a course. Now, it’s much easier. I can just
    give access to the admin panel of Django to other instructors without being involved.
    For example, the stock market analytics course happened without my involvement,
    thanks to this platform. Now, I can be less involved in the day-to-day operations
    of courses and focus more on creating them. That’s why we also did the LLM course
    this year; I finally had time to do something else besides managing the operations
    behind the courses. I want to create more courses, probably something related
    to data engineering. It also depends on what people want and what companies want
    to promote. I want to find an intersection that’s useful for both companies and
    people. Also, I need to pay for this flat, which isn’t cheap.

    and improve? That’s from Dayton, you know Dayton?
  sec: 3082
  time: '51:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 3096
  time: '51:36'
  who: Johanna
- line: Well, there are many things you can do. First of all, you can be a guest on
    the podcast. You can tell your friends about the community, help others in Slack,
    and participate in our “Project of the Week.” This is a great initiative where
    we prepare a study plan for the week and follow it. It’s a super cool project,
    but sadly, it doesn’t always get a lot of traction. We should think about how
    we can get feedback from the community to get people involved. When there’s a
    project of the week, it’s a bit disheartening when someone like Adonis, who puts
    a lot of effort into creating the plan, sees that only one person is participating.
    I believe many people are involved but not everyone is vocal about it. Maybe it
    would help if you share your progress, so others feel they’re not doing this alone.
  sec: 3098
  time: '51:38'

  sec: 3223

- line: So, we’ve had competitions before, as part of a long course, and we will have
    a competition for the ML course too. However, we haven’t had a hackathon yet,
    and that’s something I’d like to do. If anyone wants to get involved, just let
    me know.
  sec: 3226

    want to be in the guest chair, reach out. It can be about your job or anything
    that interests you. Don’t be shy!
  sec: 3243

  who: Johanna
- header: Inviting guests to the podcast
- line: Especially for first-time podcast guests! For those who have been on other
    podcasts, it might be easier since they’ve already shared their experiences. But
    it’s also interesting to hear from someone who hasn’t spoken on a podcast yet.
    Everyone has something to share. When I meet people in real life and we talk over
    tea or something, it’s always fascinating. I often think, “We should be recording
    this!” I usually invite them to do a podcast. Not everyone agrees, and I don’t
    judge anyone. It’s not for everyone, but if you want to be on the podcast, please
    reach out to us.
  sec: 3260

    haven’t decided on a specific date or month yet. We’re aiming for around April.
    We want to do two workshops before that, covering material that wasn’t addressed
    in the course. We’re discussing it now. So, you’ll definitely hear about the workshops
    soon. One is probably in November and another in February. We’ll announce them
    in our newsletter and on social media, so you won’t miss them. There will also
    be a form for signing up for the course.

    the questions for the podcast? How has this evolved over time?'
  sec: 3387
  time: '56:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: My qualifying feature for this position was that I commented on a LinkedIn
    post saying I had listened to all the episodes, which was true. Alexey reached
    out to me and asked if I wanted to help prepare the episodes almost three years
    ago. How I usually do it is that I get the guest's information and do a bit of
    research on their LinkedIn and the material they provide. I kind of stalk the
    guest a bit and come up with good topics. Then I usually meet with them before
    the episode to create some questions. They usually review them and agree on what
    they want to be asked, and then we’re ready to go. It’s a lot of fun because I
    get to learn about people’s careers and a wide range of topics. It usually takes
    me about an hour per guest, from start to finish.
  sec: 3401
  time: '56:41'
  who: Johanna
- line: Were you surprised that not all the questions you prepare get asked?
  sec: 3468
  time: '57:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, definitely! Alexey has a few backup questions, but I often have to say
    that especially after meeting the guest, I sometimes don’t listen to the episode
    again because I feel like I’ve heard everything already.
  sec: 3479

    it’s too late to start being a data scientist.
  sec: 3510
  time: '58:30'
  who: Johanna
- line: No, I don’t think it’s late. As I said before, AI is just a tool you use;
    it doesn’t replace you. If you want to become a data scientist now, it’s actually
    the best time ever. Previously, you had to learn so much just to get started.
    Now, you can ask tools like ChatGPT to help you. You just need to learn how to
    use it effectively.
  sec: 3527
  time: '58:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: However, you should keep market conditions in mind. It’s difficult to be a
    junior right now because companies are very reluctant to hire juniors. It’s a
    bit odd because everyone wants seniors, but seniors get promoted, change jobs,
    or become self-employed. Someone needs to replace them, right? The population
    of seniors is dwindling, but companies still need fresh blood. In theory, the
    hiring pyramid should have a lot of juniors, fewer mid-level, even fewer seniors,
    and so on. But right now, that pyramid is a bit skewed.

    a good opportunity for people transitioning from other fields.

    it’s starting to get heavy. Reading is maybe an overstatement for me; it’s on
    my desk with a bookmark. Sometimes, I read it. I’m also reading a book about exercises
    for my back and lower body. When it comes to courses, I’m biased about recommending
    one community that does really cool courses. You should check it out!
