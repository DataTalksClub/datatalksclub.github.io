transcript:
- line: "Last week, we talked about building data science teams, and recruiting data\
    \ scientists. Today the topic is slightly different. We'll talk about the recruitment\
    \ process, but from the candidate\u2019s point of view. We have a special guest\
    \ today, Luke. You probably know Luke as a podcast host. Usually you hear Luke\
    \ asking questions. But today the situation is different. Luke takes the guest\
    \ seat. Luke is not only a podcast host, he is also a recruiter. He's a co-founder\
    \ of Neural AI, which is a company that specializes in recruiting AI specialists,\
    \ data scientists, machine learning engineers, and others. Today, Luke will share\
    \ his experience with us and tell us how data scientists and other data professionals\
    \ can stand out during the recruitment process. Hi, Luke. Welcome."
  sec: 99
  time: '1:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi. Thanks for inviting me on the show, Alexey. This feels very weird being
    on the other side of the fence now.
  sec: 149
  time: '2:29'
  who: Luke
- header: "Luke\u2019s career and the story of Neural AI"
- line: Thanks for coming. So, Luke, let's start with your background. Can you tell
    us how you started your career? How you got into AI and how it led to co-founding
    your own recruitment company?
  sec: 160
  time: '2:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Thanks for inviting me on the show Alexey. Hi to everyone who's joined. As\
    \ Alexey said, my name is Luke, and I'm the co-founder of Neural AI. I've been\
    \ recruiting in the data analytics space for probably close to 10 years now. That\
    \ started in the traditional BI and analytic space. Naturally, as things became\
    \ more prevalent in the industry, like advanced analytics, and data science and\
    \ machine learning and deep learning, my career transitioned with it. Most people\
    \ in recruitment \u2014 99% \u2014 fell into it. Then most people fall out of\
    \ love with it. But I've stuck it out for 10 years now."
  sec: 177
  time: '2:57'
  who: Luke
- line: "Neural came around from a couple of different perspectives. One of those\
    \ perspectives was\u2026 I was just about to turn 30. I had two choices that I\
    \ could have made. I could either continue working for businesses that I have\
    \ to become a part of and embrace their values and embrace their processes and\
    \ the way that they work, or\u2026 I build something that represents what I believe,\
    \ what I feel about how recruitment should be done."
  sec: 223
  time: '3:43'
  who: Luke
- line: "Naturally, I went for the second option, and that led us to found Neural.\
    \ There's a general consensus about what the recruitment industry is. I really\
    \ wanted to create a business that counterbalanced the bad reputation that a lot\
    \ of recruitment consultants have. I wanted to create a business that A) is built\
    \ on the foundation of providing value to the actual community that we recruit\
    \ for, and B) try and live by something that makes deposits into that industry,\
    \ not just withdrawals. So, as Alexey said, I run a podcast and I'm looking into\
    \ running AI events, like seminars, to what this is. Ultimately, I wanted to create\
    \ more of a community effort rather than, \u201CHey, we've got jobs, you've got\
    \ candidates,\u201D or vice versa, \u201CYou've got a CV, we've got some jobs.\u201D\
    \ I think that's very, very old school and very transactional."
  sec: 256
  time: '4:16'
  who: Luke
- line: "For me, as I say Neural was built on the back of wanting to create something\
    \ different that is value and community driven, rather than just, \u201CHey, do\
    \ you want to work on a new business?\u201D So yeah, we started in early 2020.\
    \ So probably not the best time to start a business in the bits of a global pandemic,\
    \ but the value proposition that we've got and the specialism in data, and artificial\
    \ intelligence has really hit the mark. That's a bit about me and a bit about\
    \ my background. I hope that gives you a good snapshot."
  sec: 316
  time: '5:16'
  who: Luke
- line: "Yeah. Indeed, what you said about the bad reputation of recruiters \u2013\
    \ I think everyone can agree to that. Sometimes they just come out of nowhere,\
    \ callin... but I can tell you that Luke is different from this. And this is really\
    \ great \u2014 what you're doing, like all these podcasts and events \u2013 that\
    \ is really awesome. It's not just a cold call out of nowhere, but actually like\
    \ a community around that. That's really great and thank you Luke for doing that."
  sec: 352
  time: '5:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 387
  time: '6:27'
  who: Luke
- header: Steps in closing a data science position
- line: "Coming back to your main work as a recruiter \u2013 in data science, maybe\
    \ \u2013 I don't know if it's different from usual developer positions, or maybe\
    \ analysts. But I know that there are not so many good candidates\u2026 typically,\
    \ it's quite difficult to close positions. So, what does it involve to close a\
    \ position? What are the typical steps? How do you go around that?"
  sec: 388
  time: '6:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It is definitely more difficult than your average kind of development role\
    \ because \u2013 you've probably experienced this as well \u2014 if you speak\
    \ to 100 different people, or 100 different businesses and say, \u201CWhat is\
    \ a data scientist?\u201D \u2013 you're probably going to get 100 different answers.\
    \ One of the big challenges for us is \u2013 every single position that we work\
    \ on, is quite different from the last. Every single business that we work with\
    \ has a definition of what a machine learning engineer does, or what a data scientist\
    \ does, or what X, Y and Z does."
  sec: 422
  time: '7:02'
  who: Luke
- line: "One of the big problems \u2013 or the big challenges of the work that we\
    \ do is \u2013 that every single company is different. That in itself is a challenge,\
    \ because you need to first understand the problems and the different challenges\
    \ that those individual businesses are facing and it's difficult to group stuff\
    \ together when everyone's got a different perspective on stuff. I can't remember\
    \ the last time I worked on an easy position. Now, I don't think there's such\
    \ a thing in the data science and AI community, especially at the senior level.\
    \ But for me, I think our process breaks down into\u2026 to just give you a real\
    \ quick bullet point for what we do."
  sec: 455
  time: '7:35'
  who: Luke
- line: It breaks down into six key areas. Number one is role definition. Typically,
    we'll work with businesses to help them define the actual conditions within the
    business. A lot of companies still struggle with that, because it's still such
    a new, undefined market. We help companies define the actual positions that they're
    looking for, and offer guidance in terms of what's achievable.
  sec: 495
  time: '8:15'
  who: Luke
- line: "Secondly, we are heavily network-focused in terms of the candidates that\
    \ we typically provide. As a business, we don't advertise. We do a little bit,\
    \ but that's not our main source of candidate attraction. For us, the second point\
    \ is we would market map the talent pools of people that they're potentially looking\
    \ for \u2013 both from our network and from a headhunting perspective. So essentially,\
    \ it'd be the people that we know and the people that we don't know."
  sec: 522
  time: '8:42'
  who: Luke
- line: Thirdly, we would put together a long and short list. The long list are the
    people that we think could be okay for the role or have quite a lot of crossover.
    The shortlist of the people that we spoke to, that we know are right for that
    position. We then deliver the CV and put it into the business.
  sec: 554
  time: '9:14'
  who: Luke
- line: Following that we would manage that process of recruitment. You've got to
    think of us as your interview buddy. That's probably a really bad way to describe
    it. But we manage the process from end-to-end, both from a client and candidate
    perspective. So an interview preparation feedback, we deliver that. We help you
    prepare. We highlight concerns or positives in the process. If there are problems
    or challenges, we tend to bring that to the table, and we will try and overcome
    them with both candidate and client.
  sec: 575
  time: '9:35'
  who: Luke
- line: "Lastly, when we get to that stage, we manage the closing of the process,\
    \ both from an offer negotiation perspective, but also from resignation, and any\
    \ kind of problems that come up in the process. So, we're not a traditional recruitment\
    \ company, we do everything. The clients work with us on a singular position or\
    \ two or three positions, but they'll be on an exclusive basis. We will be essentially\
    \ an extension of that company that we're working with. And that means we run\
    \ the process in full \u2013 from end to end."
  sec: 611
  time: '10:11'
  who: Luke
- line: "Usually, how many candidates do you speak with? How wide is the funnel? How\
    \ many people do you have on this shortlist? And how many do people you talk to\u2026\
    \ you get on the phone? To close one position?"
  sec: 663
  time: '11:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's different from position to position. Because we work in those kinds\
    \ of singular positions. Some roles that we work on could be in the hundreds.\
    \ There's a role that I'm working on at the moment where I'm doing a European-wide\
    \ search, and I've long-listed probably about 25 candidates across the whole of\
    \ Europe. It's really, really vast from\u2026 10 to 20 candidates up to 200-300\
    \ candidates, depending on the type of position."
  sec: 683
  time: '11:23'
  who: Luke
- line: "As I mentioned this earlier, we don't actively advertise. We don't advertise\
    \ lots of positions and stuff. So we don't deal with the volume of candidates\
    \ that you guys at OLX have. To give an example \u2013 one of my clients in Munich,\
    \ for one position, for an AI engineer \u2013 they've received like 1300 CVs.\
    \ We would never look at that amount of CVs. So we're not volume. On average,\
    \ we probably look between 10 and 20 CVs a day, something like that. That's across\
    \ all positions that we're working on."
  sec: 719
  time: '11:59'
  who: Luke
- line: Well 10-20 CVs per day, still quite a few CVs to look at.
  sec: 767
  time: '12:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 774
  time: '12:54'
  who: Luke
- line: "It\u2019s not the volume that we our recruiters have to deal with \u2013\
    \ but it's still quite a lot of CVs that you need to look at every day."
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: "90-95% of the people that we work with \u2013 we are approaching. It might\
    \ not necessarily just be a CV, but it might be: set up conversations with people\
    \ on LinkedIn and stuff like that. So I'd say \u201Cprofiles\u201D in general\
    \ \u2013 probably between 10 and 20. But that might be going through someone's\
    \ LinkedIn or an actual profile or X, Y, Z."
  sec: 786
  time: '13:06'
  who: Luke
- header: "Getting recruiter\u2019s attention"
- line: "In these 10-20 profiles, what does usually get your attention? What do you\
    \ look at typically? When you say, \u201COkay, I really have to call this candidate.\u201D\
    \ Versus \u201COkay, I'm not sure. Maybe I'll talk to this person later when I\
    \ first deal with these other candidates.\u201D"
  sec: 817
  time: '13:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: "When we spoke about this before, I tried to look back at some of the old\
    \ CVs that I've been like, \u201CYes, they look amazing!\u201D And I will try\
    \ and substantiate all of these points. So it makes it really easily understandable.\
    \ I start from the kind of \u2018first opening\u2019 of a CV\u2026 As a disclaimer\
    \ for anyone who's listening right now \u2013 this is one person's view, and it's\
    \ very subjective."
  sec: 847
  time: '14:07'
  who: Luke
- line: "I'm a bit of a sucker for good design from an artistic perspective. This\
    \ is something that your reader will see before they start reading your CV. So\
    \ I try and live by something \u2013 which is: your interview starts as soon as\
    \ they open your CV, and before they start reading your CV. The first thing that\
    \ they see is how well-designed your CV actually is. So I always comment when\
    \ I can clearly see that someone has taken the time to format and design their\
    \ CV in a way that is really attractive."
  sec: 876
  time: '14:36'
  who: Luke
- line: "This is the representation of you. If I open a CV, and it looks great \u2013\
    \ I'm instantly interested about what's on the CV. Whereas, if I open a CV and\
    \ think \u201CHmm\u2026 that looks pretty awful,\u201D it sets a negative tone\
    \ before someone's even started reading. From my perspective, I think design is\
    \ a really big part of that."
  sec: 916
  time: '15:16'
  who: Luke
- line: "If we're talking about content specifically\u2026 for me, it breaks down\
    \ into three key areas that I look for, and try and tick boxes in my own head.\
    \ Again \u2013 this is a disclaimer \u2013 but businesses pay us to find specific\
    \ people, so we're probably a lot more critical on the profiles that we're looking\
    \ at. There's definitely a difference between being an internal talent acquisition\
    \ and the headhunter."
  sec: 940
  time: '15:40'
  who: Luke
- line: "Number one is, I\u2019ll instantly look for the crossover between the business\
    \ and the role that they're applying for with the company that they're currently\
    \ working in. The reason I say that is not because it's a name game, or\u2026\
    \ It's not because it's all about the business that you work for. But it's primarily\
    \ to do with the industry challenges that that business is facing, and how well\
    \ would you be able to actually understand those industry challenges."
  sec: 975
  time: '16:15'
  who: Luke
- line: "For example, if you're a data scientist at Audi, and you're applying for\
    \ a data science position at BMW, and you're instantly recognized more, because\
    \ you should understand the industry that you're working in, and the conversation\
    \ that you can have internally with the business that you're applying for will\
    \ be a lot higher than someone who doesn't understand that industry. Again, this\
    \ is not a name game. But it definitely does add value to your CV. When I say,\
    \ \u201CRight, I'm looking for someone like BMW, or Zalando, or Adidas, or an\
    \ autonomous driving startup.\u201D The first thing that I see is that you're\
    \ working in a very, very similar business. That's point one."
  sec: 1005
  time: '16:45'
  who: Luke
- line: "Point number two is\u2026 It's not just all about that business \u2013 It's\
    \ mainly to do with the use-cases and the actual projects that you're working\
    \ on right now. I tend to look for how close or how far you are away from the\
    \ actual use cases and problems that you're going to be working on. Because the\
    \ clients that we typically work with \u2013 they come to us with specific roles,\
    \ working on specific things. So my first thing is \u2014 how close are you from\
    \ a business perspective? Secondly, how close are you from a use-case perspective?\
    \ And how much crossover is actually there across those two things? If those two\
    \ things aren't there \u2013 it's actually really difficult\u2026 Maybe other\
    \ headhunters have got a different spin on this, but for me \u2013 I think that\
    \ culturally, you could be great from an alignment perspective, and you probably\
    \ could be good for that business, but from a headhunting perspective\u2026 If\
    \ we were working together right now, Alexey, and you said to me, \u201CHey, I\
    \ need this, this, this, this and this,\u201D and the profile that I gave to you\
    \ in response to that, didn't have any of that, but I said, \u201Cbut you\u2019\
    ll really like this person, and culturally, they'll fit in.\u201D Your feedback\
    \ would be, \u201CThat's not what we're looking for.\u201D So again, those are\
    \ the first two things."
  sec: 1050
  time: '17:30'
  who: Luke
- line: "Lastly, I do look for that kind of cultural and industry alignment. This\
    \ isn't typically the business per se, but it's the type of business that you're\
    \ working for. If you're working for a huge global financial services business,\
    \ and you're applying for a 10-man startup company, there are going to be some\
    \ huge, cultural differences between those two businesses. And for me, I'm like,\
    \ \u201CAre they gonna get that industry?\u201D And vice versa. If you've had\
    \ a start-up career, are you going to get working in a big financial services\
    \ industry? 9 times out of 10, there's so much difference between those industries\
    \ or businesses that it usually doesn't work."
  sec: 1136
  time: '18:56'
  who: Luke
- line: "That's the first thing that I look for\u2026 and that's the first thing that\
    \ kind of pops up. But on top of that... One of the things that really gets me\
    \ about CVs... Sometimes I'll open a profile, and their tech stack overview, and\
    \ they \u2013 their profile, not their projects \u2013 looks amazing, right? And\
    \ they've got every tech on there, every programming language, TensorFlow, PyTorch\
    \ \u2013 all different use cases. But when I actually look at the projects that\
    \ they've been working on, those two things are not linked. So it's just buzzword\
    \ bingo on their CV, but the actual projects \u2014 things that are actually done\
    \ \u2014 don't link to that. For me, the second point is \u2013 and this is really\
    \ obvious, but \u2013 your projects are related to the tech stack that you\u2019\
    ve got there. You'll be surprised about how many profiles don't do that. Your\
    \ CV should be a representation of what you're doing. If you claim to know, X,\
    \ Y, and Z, you should be able to back that up with specific examples of projects\
    \ and be able to illustrate that in your CV."
  sec: 1190
  time: '19:50'
  who: Luke
- line: "Just to clarify \u2013 by your projects, you mean, not necessarily projects\
    \ on GitHub \u2013 but a list of projects that this person has done previously,\
    \ right?"
  sec: 1260
  time: '21:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I think it's both. It depends on what level you're coming in\u2026\
    \ This is the difficult thing, it's all very singular. That might be the case\
    \ for one person, but there might be a more junior candidate trying to make or\
    \ break into the industry. Then I would want to see what GitHub projects or personal\
    \ projects you've worked on, which would illustrate that technical experience\
    \ and that understanding."
  sec: 1276
  time: '21:16'
  who: Luke
- line: "But if you're more senior\u2026 if you tell me that you know X \u2013 you've\
    \ got to show me where you've done that, or how you've used that. So the second\
    \ main point is that I would want to see that the projects that you've worked\
    \ on are a representation of the tech stack that you think that you understand."
  sec: 1303
  time: '21:43'
  who: Luke
- line: "Lastly, this breaks down into three key categories, which is tenure, common\
    \ themes and growth. If I look at CV, I would want to see that someone had had\
    \ a good amount of time in the businesses that they've worked in, and not jumped\
    \ from place to place for an extra 5K K, or just a new change of scenery. As a\
    \ headhunter, I think, \u201Care you someone who's going to carefully choose the\
    \ right industry and the right opportunity for you \u2013 but are you actually\
    \ gonna stay there?\u201D"
  sec: 1328
  time: '22:08'
  who: Luke
- line: "And then secondly, the common themes and growth, it's \u2014 have you got\
    \ a purpose in terms of your career right now? Have you done a huge amount of\
    \ broad projects? And you go from one data science job to another? Or you are\
    \ like \u201CI'm really interested in this sector, or industry, or type of clients,\
    \ and that's where I'm really going.\u201D And growth. I would want to see some\
    \ progress in their career. If you're a data scientist now, but you were a data\
    \ scientist five years ago \u2013 my first question would be why haven't you progressed?\
    \ Run me through that. I know, there's gonna be some examples of people that just\
    \ want to do that one particular position. But I would want to understand those\
    \ kinds of points. So that's what I typically look for. Sorry if I just threw\
    \ loads of information out there."
  sec: 1368
  time: '22:48'
  who: Luke
- line: "Let me summarize what you said and then you tell me if I got it right. So\
    \ first, you look at the design \u2014 it shouldn't be completely bad and faceless.\
    \ Just a bit of creativity will not hurt your CV \u2014 to get your attention.\
    \ Then you look at the industry, where the candidate works. It should be as close\
    \ as possible to the industry of your client. It also involves cultural fit\u2026\
    \ If your position is in a startup, then the ideal candidate will have experience\
    \ working at a startup, right?"
  sec: 1421
  time: '23:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right
  sec: 1469

- header: Project portfolio
- line: "Then you also look at projects. What is important in projects? Is that they\
    \ are linked to actual skills. So it's not just a bunch of buzzwords on CV, but\
    \ actually, for each project \u2013 it's clear for you how these skills were used.\
    \ Finally, you look at people who don't jump too often from position to position.\
    \ Who have focus. And also you look at career progression. Did I get it right?"
  sec: 1470
  time: '24:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Just on the use-cases... For me \u2013 you can work on recommendation\
    \ systems in Spotify, or GetYourGuide and then also work on recommendation systems\
    \ in Zalando. It's about finding balance between understanding those kinds of\
    \ industries and understanding the use-cases that those industries would typically\
    \ work on. The thing with data science \u2013 it's about understanding the business\
    \ problem, to be able to apply your skills to solve those problems."
  sec: 1504
  time: '25:04'
  who: Luke
- line: "So for me, it's a combination between thinking, \u201Cright, do you know\
    \ the industry?\u201D and \u201Cdo you know the use cases?\u201D Or \u2014 do\
    \ you know the industry, but might have slightly different use cases? Or \u2014\
