transcript:
- line: "This week, we'll talk about building an open source data company, and not\
    \ just building but\u2026 It's not the first time we have our guest, Adrian, on\
    \ this podcast. Before, we spoke about being a data freelancer, so we'll talk\
    \ about building an open source company as a data freelancer in the past, I guess.\
    \ The special guest we have today is Adrian. Adrian started working in data quite\
    \ some time ago \u2013 in 2012 for Berlin startups. Then he joined a corporation,\
    \ and quickly found out that this is not what he likes, so then he decided to\
    \ freelance."

  who: Alexey
- line: "He freelanced for quite some time. We have another interview with Adrian,\
    \ as I mentioned, where he talks quite a lot about his experience. But today,\
    \ we invited Adrian again to talk about what happened after freelancing. This\
    \ is also a question where many people think, \u201COkay, now I can do freelance,\
    \ but maybe I don't want to do this forever. What's next?\u201D So today, we'll\
    \ talk about that. Welcome, again, to our podcast."

  who: Adrian
- line: "Yeah. The questions for today\u2019s interviews were prepared mostly by Adrian,\
    \ but also Johanna helped. Johanna always helps. Thanks, Johanna. I see you're\
    \ here in the chat, so big heart. Thanks for doing that. Let's start."

- header: "Adrian\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go into our main topic of building an open source data company,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 199
  time: '3:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Sure. I just want to first mention that the questions were actually prepared\
    \ thanks to Yovid, in case he\u2019s in the audience. He basically asked me these\
    \ questions last week, and I was able to just use most of them."
  sec: 208
  time: '3:28'
  who: Adrian
- line: Who?
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: A data engineer, Yovid. I'm not sure if he's in the chat right now.
  sec: 225
  time: '3:45'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay.
  sec: 229
  time: '3:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Anyway, what was the question you asked? Why did I start freelancing, or?
  sec: 230
  time: '3:50'
  who: Adrian
- line: "No, the question was \u2013 for those who did not listen to our previous\
    \ podcast, maybe you can give us an overview of your career journey so far."
  sec: 235
  time: '3:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. So as you were saying, I started working in data in 2012. I started
    freelancing some five, six years ago. I've already stopped by now. That was an
    amazing change of pace from employment, mostly because it gave me a lot of autonomy.
    It allowed me to really consider what I want to do with my life and with my time.
    It also put me in the position where I was able to save and invest, which also
    opened up different chapters and options in life.
  sec: 243
  time: '4:03'
  who: Adrian
- line: "I would say, I was on the freelancing path, which I think is entrepreneurial,\
    \ for about five years\u2019 time, during which I had quite a few learnings about\
    \ what could be the next step. This is how we got here. I would guess the next\
    \ logical step for me was taking more risk, actually \u2013 looking into how I\
    \ can invest my time better than just freelancing."
  sec: 243
  time: '4:03'
  who: Adrian
- line: You were freelancing as a data engineer, right?
  sec: 315
  time: '5:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. I mean, I did all kinds of things, because I tried to figure out what's\
    \ interesting to people and what's interesting to me. One of the things that I\
    \ was doing as a freelancer was data engineering, of which I would say maybe half\
    \ of the things were first-time setups \u2013 commonly called build and hire,\
    \ where you build out a data warehouse and hire a team. The other half, I would\
    \ say, were just generic data engineering projects. When I wasn't doing data engineering,\
    \ I was doing a little bit of consulting. This was, basically, how you should\
    \ do your data engineering, more or less, or how you should structure your team."
  sec: 320
  time: '5:20'
  who: Adrian
- line: "For me, freelancing is exchanging time for money. The image I have in my\
    \ head is \u2013 a company needs somebody and then you say, \u201COkay, I charge\
    \ 100 euros per hour,\u201D or 1000 per day, or whatever. You say how much you\
    \ charge and then they say, \u201COkay, we\u2019ll hire you for three months to\
    \ do this thing.\u201D But I remember that in our previous interview, you also\
    \ talked about other things. It was not just that, but other different kinds of\
    \ freelancing, where sometimes it's more than that."
  sec: 361
  time: '6:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Maybe a company needs to build a data warehouse and you say, \u201COkay,\
    \ it\u2019s difficult to do for me alone, but I have my friends, who can also\
    \ join. Instead of charging you per hour, I will charge you per project.\u201D\
    \ Then it's more entrepreneurial, right? It's not just \u201CGive me 100 euros\
    \ and I will just sit there, and then calculate how many hours I spent.\u201D\
    \ But you say, \u201CThis is the problem we have. This is the solution I can provide.\
    \ This is what I need in exchange.\u201D It's a bit different. You provide a solution\
    \ to the problem, rather than just selling your time. For me, it was already quite\
    \ entrepreneurial."
  sec: 361
  time: '6:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. The customer typically already wants to know how much they're roughly
    going to pay for what they get. They don't actually care about your hourly rate,
    generally. They care about the final outcome and what it costs them.
  sec: 438
  time: '7:18'
  who: Adrian
- header: The benefits of freelancing
- line: "Okay. You worked as a freelancer for some time. [Adrian agrees] Although,\
    \ as we just talked about, there are all these different kinds of freelancing,\
    \ where you just exchange time for money, where you sell projects, where you can\
    \ bring your friends to help you, and so on. Why did you want to do something\
    \ else? What triggered you to change from freelancing? It looked like you were\
    \ already making a lot of impact. It can be quite satisfying when you don't just\
    \ exchange time for money, but you also get paid for delivering the project. It's\
    \ different \u2013 it can be pretty fulfilling, I guess."
  sec: 454
  time: '7:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It was. I can't complain about freelancing \u2013 I really enjoyed it. And\
    \ I still think it's the, let's say, best lifestyle thing that somebody can do.\
    \ Compared to employment, or compared to founding, it's probably the role where\
    \ you have most autonomy. So if you are actually looking to also have a holistic\
    \ life and invest in other areas, that's a pretty good position to be in."
  sec: 496
  time: '8:16'
  who: Adrian
- line: "Holistic life. That\u2019s like when you can go fishing on a Wednesday."
  sec: 521
  time: '8:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Go fishing on a Wednesday, for example. You can decide every day what you're\
    \ doing more or less. Of course, you need to be civilized and do it within the\
    \ boundaries of other people working with you. But you do have a lot of autonomy\
    \ and freedom. I would say I enjoyed that very much. But there is always something\
    \ in the back of the head that goes, \u201CI want more. I want something different.\u201D\
    \ Once you do something for a while, at least for me, it starts getting boring.\
    \ I have to say that, you know, I built a lot of data warehouses and at some point\
    \ it gets really old. Of course, when you are freelancing, people know you for\
    \ what you do, so they will offer you more of the same work."
  sec: 526
  time: '8:46'
  who: Adrian
- line: "What I was doing in the later stages of my freelancing was also sub-contracting.\
    \ Like you were describing, a customer has a need, and I didn't have some of the\
    \ skills to deliver some of those things, but I could subcontract someone to help\
    \ us to deliver. I did that. This changes your role a little bit from a single\
    \ contributor, where you have a lot of autonomy, to something more like an agency\
    \ manager, where you suddenly have a lot more communication and a lot more answering\
    \ lines. Your autonomy goes down and your revenue goes up, but I would say that\
    \ happiness also went down for me when starting in that direction. This basically\
    \ brings it to the question of \u201CWhat next?\u201D More of the same gets old\
    \ and if you look into how to improve things, you could go in the agency direction\
    \ and make it a bigger business. But that doesn't seem fun, personally."
  sec: 526
  time: '8:46'
  who: Adrian
- header: Having an agency vs freelancing
- line: In the case of an agency, you would actually have a company, you would hire
    people, you would negotiate with potential customers on what to deliver, and then
    people from your agency go and work, right?
  sec: 638
  time: '10:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. It's a different business at that point, because it's not only about\
    \ you and your personal choices. Now you have employees, and you have some responsibilities\
    \ around that. You need to make ends meet, because if you have an unpleasant customer,\
    \ it's easy to fire them when you're a freelancer \u2013 you just go to a different\
    \ project. But when you have a whole team of people and you need to keep them\
    \ employed, it becomes more difficult. You're also managing the flow of people\
    \ \u2013 it's a completely different job, fundamentally. There is also, let's\
    \ say, a question of incentive."
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Adrian
- line: When you're personally a freelancer, it's quite easy to just be aligned with
    your own system of values, whereas when you own an agency, and you have to pay
    the bills of the people that you've hired, I would say you start to have multiple
    responsibilities, some of which might conflict directly with your values. You
    might have to work with a customer for the good of your company, where you might
    have not chosen to work with this customer otherwise.
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Adrian
- line: "That's one of the potential next steps for a solo freelancer? When you're\
    \ a solo freelancer, and you want to do something bigger, an agency is one of\
    \ the options \u2013 but with all the pros and cons we discussed. The pros being\
    \ having more money, and the cons, I guess, are all these things that you mentioned.\
    \ For some, it might be fine, but not for everyone. Another option would be creating\
    \ a product, right?"
  sec: 721
  time: '12:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: "You could always go and do something more esoteric \u2013 that's different\
    \ from core freelancing. You could go build a product on your own, but that sounds\
    \ pretty risky. Or you could go down, let's say, the path of creating a company.\
    \ Because fundamentally, I wanted to build a product. But in order to enable making\
    \ that happen, you need to align multiple incentives with that. If I just want\
    \ to build something by myself in isolation, for nobody's benefit, I can do that.\
    \ But if you want things to end up in front of people, if you want them to be\
    \ of a high quality, if you want people to help you, it's a different game. That's\
    \ no longer, let's say, the resource drain \u2013 to make something like this\
    \ happen takes more than the effort of one person. Also on the skills part."
  sec: 751
  time: '12:31'
  who: Adrian
- header: What let Adrian to switch over from freelancing
- line: "Okay. Usually, you don't just wake up and say, \u201COkay, now I quit freelancing.\
    \ Let's try to build a product.\u201D [Adrian agrees] It happens gradually, right?\
    \ So there was something you saw that you were doing over and over again. Right?"
  sec: 807
  time: '13:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I was telling you about building data warehouses over and over again \u2013\
    \ that does get pretty old. I would say that the reason why I didn't enjoy it\
    \ anymore \u2013 it was not really challenging. The technical challenges get simple\
    \ if you've been a data engineer for a few years and then it's just the people\
    \ problem. It's kind of the same problem on repeat \u2013 educating stakeholders\
    \ that \u201Ctotal margin\u201D doesn't mean anything, and you need an actual\
    \ metric, educating stakeholders that \u201Cnumber of customers\u201D means different\
    \ things to different teams. I can give an example where I was done building a\
    \ data warehouse, technically, in two weeks, and then we spent two months getting\
    \ everyone on the same page as to what \u201Cthe customer\u201D is and which ones\
    \ they're tracking and which ones they're reporting on. It was literally mind-blowing.\
    \ What happened for me was, I thought, \u201COkay, I don't want to do\u2026\u201D\
    \ The technical challenge for me was easy to solve, but what I realized is that\
    \ it's not easy for everyone else on the team."
  sec: 822
  time: '13:42'
  who: Adrian
- line: Data engineers are often a bottleneck in organizations. What I was trying
    to do with my work of building and hiring was to always empower our others to
    take over. It wasn't a game where I wanted to be the centerpiece of data engineering
    for the next five years at this company. In order to do that, I was looking for
    easy ways in which other people can take on the engineering role. Like I said,
    I think it's a pretty low-complexity role in terms of technical requirements,
    but it's not necessarily easy to learn and to get there. If you actually have
    everything available to you, such as boilerplate code, then you could just use
    it as a data person, and you don't need all the engineering to happen. This is
    how the product idea actually came to be. Which I guess is more or less what you
    were asking, right?
  sec: 822
  time: '13:42'
  who: Adrian
- line: "Well, yeah \u2013 more or less. I was curious, what exactly you saw that\
    \ made you think, \u201COkay, so many companies have this problem. If I put a\
    \ solution to this problem in a box, instead of selling my services to these companies\u2026\
    \u201D You could say, \u201COkay, this is the solution and you can actually use\
    \ this solution on your own. You don't need me to use the solution.\u201D"
  sec: 948
  time: '15:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I can give you some examples. You have a lot of really smart people\
    \ working in the data field right now and even more smart people not working in\
    \ the data field and wanting to. So you have all these new-generation Python users\
    \ that\u2026 they're brilliant \u2013 they were exposed to programming languages\
    \ earlier than the rest of us and they've had opportunities and chances that we\
    \ dream of sometimes that we had ourselves. They're uniquely positioned to be\
    \ able to solve these kinds of problems, but they need the right tools, because\
    \ they don't have five years to develop the engineering skills and learnings that\
    \ it might take for a data engineer."
  sec: 976
  time: '16:16'
  who: Adrian
- line: "What I noticed was a few patterns such as, these Python people can easily\
    \ use Pandas, and they can get some data from an API, they can use pandas and\
    \ SQL to load some data \u2013 fundamentally, the skills are there. It's just\
    \ about the in-depth engineering knowledge that isn't quite there. There was another\
    \ common antipattern \u2013 people were basically just throwing JSON strings into\
    \ databases. This happens quite frequently. The reason why people do this is,\
    \ because they have a problem and this is a solution. Right? No one's just being\
    \ evil or shitty about code quality. Basically, I thought, \u201COkay, we need\
    \ some good dev tooling to help us do what these people are trying to do. They're\
    \ not doing things in a good way, in terms of engineering. [This tooling needs\
    \ to] help them basically do it faster, better, harder, stronger.\u201D"

  time: '16:16'
  who: Adrian
- line: "From what I heard from you\u2026 I know a bit about the product (the tool)\
    \ you\u2019re working on. What I heard is \u2013when you have a data warehouse,\
    \ you don't just have it for the sake of having it, you need to put some data\
    \ in it. Then you have a bunch of JSON data coming from endpoints or from somewhere.\
    \ Then, you need to take this JSON data and put it into a data warehouse or some\
    \ sort of database and the easiest way of doing this is just to take the JSON\
    \ as-is and put it to Postgres (because in Postgres, you have this JSON field\
    \ or whatever). I think for all the major data warehouses, you can just put JSON\
    \ data in there."

  who: Adrian
- line: "What people were doing is, naturally \u2013 you have this type, you have\
    \ a bunch of JSON, \u201CHmm. The easiest way is just take the JSON and put it\
    \ in the database.\u201D Right? Because not everyone knows that maybe it's not\
    \ the best solution, but it kind of works all right. So you saw that. You saw\
    \ that people can actually do that \u2013they can use Python \u2013 but this is\
    \ not the best thing to do for a data warehouse, because it's expensive and you\
    \ don't want to just put complex objects there because it's more difficult."
  sec: 1125
  time: '18:45'
  who: Alexey

    \ on."
  sec: 1158
  time: '19:18'
  who: Adrian
- line: "So you saw that and you thought, \u201COkay, what if there was a tool that\
    \ could just easily enable them to do that? Then, instead of having a bunch of\
    \ JSON fields in the database, they have something proper.\u201D Right?"
  sec: 1163
  time: '19:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Basically, databases like type flat tables. For example, JSON doesn't\
    \ have date/time, so when you load JSON to a database, you're creating a date/time\
    \ string, kind of. You're just creating strings. Then somebody has to come and\
    \ say, \u201CThis is a timestamp. Let me extract it from the JSON. Let me give\
    \ it the right type. Now we can actually use it.\u201D So I tried to kind of jump\
    \ over these steps so we don't have to have a human that is manually guessing\
    \ what each data type is and unpacking this data and making it clean. Basically,\
    \ this tool that I was working on facilitates just taking unknown JSON data and\
    \ putting it in a tabular relational format in the database."
  sec: 1178
  time: '19:38'
  who: Adrian
- line: "I say \u201Crelational\u201D because JSON can have sub-structures, such as\
    \ lists, within the JSON, which you cannot represent within a simple type. You\
    \ need to either break it out into a new table, or keep it as some kind of array.\
    \ Databases like tables, not arrays. This is kind of the idea \u2013 it just makes\
    \ it easy. You have, let's say, declarative ways of loading \u2013 I can replace,\
    \ I can append, I can upsert or merge the data. You also have a lot of tweaks\
    \ that data engineers care about. I won't really go into a lot of details here\
    \ about that, but\u2026 you put the JSON in the database, but the data engineer\
    \ will worry about, \u201COkay, what's the distribution key? What are the primary\
    \ key performance considerations? Maybe I want the data contract.\u201D Things\
    \ like that."
  sec: 1178
  time: '19:38'
  who: Adrian
- line: "From what I heard \u2013 you said that people who are not necessarily experienced\
    \ data engineers, but know some Python, can just take these JSONs and throw them\
    \ into the data warehouse. But also, if I'm an experienced data engineer, this\
    \ is kind of repetitive \u2013 I have this bunch of JSON files or JSON data and\
    \ then I have to parse them and think, \u201COkay, for this, because it's nested,\
    \ I need to create this table in this table. This is a one-to-many relationship.\u201D\
    \ And then you spend a week messing with JSON structures and creating a table\
    \ structure, and then doing all the mapping."
  sec: 1280
  time: '21:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Even if you have experience, it's kind of repetitive. Then you join another
    company, and then you have the same problem. Then you join another company as
    a freelancer, and, again, they have the same problem. So it feels super repetitive,
    right? Because you need to do the same thing over and over again. Even if you
    do it correctly, as a data engineer, you still end up doing a lot of stuff again,
    and again.
  sec: 1280
  time: '21:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, and ultimately, correctly, it's a matter of best guess, right? Because\
    \ when you're referring to types from a weakly-typed data like JSON, you could\
    \ be wrong. There's nothing preventing JSON from sending you a number today, and\
    \ a string tomorrow \u2013 JSON internally doesn't have any kind of type consistency\
    \ between records. You want something that also reduces maintenance, because we\
    \ can guess what the data is, but we might find out that we are wrong two days\
    \ later, when the data doesn't load. We don't want to do that. The more data you\
    \ have, the more you try to avoid this, typically, and you try to curate it upfront,\
    \ which generates a whole another set of problems. Now you have to talk to stakeholders\
    \ and people and it takes so much longer."

    \ data loading tool before \u2013 it's called Growth Full Stack. It's something\
    \ like Fivetran for a specific vertical. There, I had the pleasure of playing\
    \ with the concept a little bit. Okay, you have the side of what the right way\
    \ for taking something to people so they can use it is, and then you have the\
    \ building side of how it could be and how it should be. I would say it took me\
    \ some time to actually formulate some stronger opinions about how it could be\
    \ built. Once we started building it, there are multiple layers of abstractions\
    \ of how you could build something like this \u2013 it could be built in a way\
    \ that engineers love, or it could be built in a way that any Python person can\
    \ understand."

    product, kind of. For me as a data engineer, I never thought about things that
