transcript:
- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: 'Episode Overview: Building an Open‑Source Data Company'
- line: This week, we'll talk about building an open source data company, and not
    just building but… It's not the first time we have our guest, Adrian, on this
    podcast. Before, we spoke about being a data freelancer, so we'll talk about building
    an open source company as a data freelancer in the past, I guess. The special
    guest we have today is Adrian. Adrian started working in data quite some time
    ago – in 2012 for Berlin startups. Then he joined a corporation, and quickly found
    out that this is not what he likes, so then he decided to freelance.
  sec: 113
  time: '1:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: He freelanced for quite some time. We have another interview with Adrian,
    as I mentioned, where he talks quite a lot about his experience. But today, we
    invited Adrian again to talk about what happened after freelancing. This is also
    a question where many people think, “Okay, now I can do freelance, but maybe I
    don't want to do this forever. What's next?” So today, we'll talk about that.
    Welcome, again, to our podcast.
  sec: 113
  time: '1:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you, Alexey.
  sec: 180
  time: '3:00'
  who: Adrian
- line: Yeah. The questions for today’s interviews were prepared mostly by Adrian,
    but also Johanna helped. Johanna always helps. Thanks, Johanna. I see you're here
    in the chat, so big heart. Thanks for doing that. Let's start.
  sec: 183
  time: '3:03'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Origins: 2012 Berlin Startups and Corporate Exit'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of building an open source data company,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 199
  time: '3:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I just want to first mention that the questions were actually prepared
    thanks to Yovid, in case he’s in the audience. He basically asked me these questions
    last week, and I was able to just use most of them.
  sec: 208
  time: '3:28'
  who: Adrian
- line: Who?
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: A data engineer, Yovid. I'm not sure if he's in the chat right now.
  sec: 225
  time: '3:45'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay.
  sec: 229
  time: '3:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Anyway, what was the question you asked? Why did I start freelancing, or?
  sec: 230
  time: '3:50'
  who: Adrian
- line: No, the question was – for those who did not listen to our previous podcast,
    maybe you can give us an overview of your career journey so far.
  sec: 235
  time: '3:55'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Freelancing Experience: Autonomy, Savings, Diverse Projects'
- line: Right. So as you were saying, I started working in data in 2012. I started
    freelancing some five, six years ago. I've already stopped by now. That was an
    amazing change of pace from employment, mostly because it gave me a lot of autonomy.
    It allowed me to really consider what I want to do with my life and with my time.
    It also put me in the position where I was able to save and invest, which also
    opened up different chapters and options in life.
  sec: 243
  time: '4:03'
  who: Adrian
- line: I would say, I was on the freelancing path, which I think is entrepreneurial,
    for about five years’ time, during which I had quite a few learnings about what
    could be the next step. This is how we got here. I would guess the next logical
    step for me was taking more risk, actually – looking into how I can invest my
    time better than just freelancing.
  sec: 243
  time: '4:03'
  who: Adrian
- line: You were freelancing as a data engineer, right?
  sec: 315
  time: '5:15'
  who: Alexey
- header: From Hourly Billing to Project-Based Work and Subcontracting
- line: Yes. I mean, I did all kinds of things, because I tried to figure out what's
    interesting to people and what's interesting to me. One of the things that I was
    doing as a freelancer was data engineering, of which I would say maybe half of
    the things were first-time setups – commonly called build and hire, where you
    build out a data warehouse and hire a team. The other half, I would say, were
    just generic data engineering projects. When I wasn't doing data engineering,
    I was doing a little bit of consulting. This was, basically, how you should do
    your data engineering, more or less, or how you should structure your team.
  sec: 320
  time: '5:20'
  who: Adrian
- line: For me, freelancing is exchanging time for money. The image I have in my head
    is – a company needs somebody and then you say, “Okay, I charge 100 euros per
    hour,” or 1000 per day, or whatever. You say how much you charge and then they
    say, “Okay, we’ll hire you for three months to do this thing.” But I remember
    that in our previous interview, you also talked about other things. It was not
    just that, but other different kinds of freelancing, where sometimes it's more
    than that.
  sec: 361
  time: '6:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe a company needs to build a data warehouse and you say, “Okay, it’s difficult
    to do for me alone, but I have my friends, who can also join. Instead of charging
    you per hour, I will charge you per project.” Then it's more entrepreneurial,
    right? It's not just “Give me 100 euros and I will just sit there, and then calculate
    how many hours I spent.” But you say, “This is the problem we have. This is the
    solution I can provide. This is what I need in exchange.” It's a bit different.
    You provide a solution to the problem, rather than just selling your time. For
    me, it was already quite entrepreneurial.
  sec: 361
  time: '6:01'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Freelancing Lifestyle: Flexibility and Long‑Term Boredom'
- line: Exactly. The customer typically already wants to know how much they're roughly
    going to pay for what they get. They don't actually care about your hourly rate,
    generally. They care about the final outcome and what it costs them.
  sec: 438
  time: '7:18'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay. You worked as a freelancer for some time. [Adrian agrees] Although,
    as we just talked about, there are all these different kinds of freelancing, where
    you just exchange time for money, where you sell projects, where you can bring
    your friends to help you, and so on. Why did you want to do something else? What
    triggered you to change from freelancing? It looked like you were already making
    a lot of impact. It can be quite satisfying when you don't just exchange time
    for money, but you also get paid for delivering the project. It's different –
    it can be pretty fulfilling, I guess.
  sec: 454
  time: '7:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was. I can't complain about freelancing – I really enjoyed it. And I still
    think it's the, let's say, best lifestyle thing that somebody can do. Compared
    to employment, or compared to founding, it's probably the role where you have
    most autonomy. So if you are actually looking to also have a holistic life and
    invest in other areas, that's a pretty good position to be in.
  sec: 496
  time: '8:16'
  who: Adrian
- line: Holistic life. That’s like when you can go fishing on a Wednesday.
  sec: 521
  time: '8:41'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Subcontracting Growth: Agency‑like Management Tradeoffs'
- line: Go fishing on a Wednesday, for example. You can decide every day what you're
    doing more or less. Of course, you need to be civilized and do it within the boundaries
    of other people working with you. But you do have a lot of autonomy and freedom.
    I would say I enjoyed that very much. But there is always something in the back
    of the head that goes, “I want more. I want something different.” Once you do
    something for a while, at least for me, it starts getting boring. I have to say
    that, you know, I built a lot of data warehouses and at some point it gets really
    old. Of course, when you are freelancing, people know you for what you do, so
    they will offer you more of the same work.
  sec: 526
  time: '8:46'
  who: Adrian
- line: What I was doing in the later stages of my freelancing was also sub-contracting.
    Like you were describing, a customer has a need, and I didn't have some of the
    skills to deliver some of those things, but I could subcontract someone to help
    us to deliver. I did that. This changes your role a little bit from a single contributor,
    where you have a lot of autonomy, to something more like an agency manager, where
    you suddenly have a lot more communication and a lot more answering lines. Your
    autonomy goes down and your revenue goes up, but I would say that happiness also
    went down for me when starting in that direction. This basically brings it to
    the question of “What next?” More of the same gets old and if you look into how
    to improve things, you could go in the agency direction and make it a bigger business.
    But that doesn't seem fun, personally.
  sec: 526
  time: '8:46'
  who: Adrian
- line: In the case of an agency, you would actually have a company, you would hire
    people, you would negotiate with potential customers on what to deliver, and then
    people from your agency go and work, right?
  sec: 638
  time: '10:38'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Agency Challenges: Responsibility, Incentives, and Misalignment'
- line: Yeah. It's a different business at that point, because it's not only about
    you and your personal choices. Now you have employees, and you have some responsibilities
    around that. You need to make ends meet, because if you have an unpleasant customer,
    it's easy to fire them when you're a freelancer – you just go to a different project.
    But when you have a whole team of people and you need to keep them employed, it
    becomes more difficult. You're also managing the flow of people – it's a completely
    different job, fundamentally. There is also, let's say, a question of incentive.
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Adrian
- line: When you're personally a freelancer, it's quite easy to just be aligned with
    your own system of values, whereas when you own an agency, and you have to pay
    the bills of the people that you've hired, I would say you start to have multiple
    responsibilities, some of which might conflict directly with your values. You
    might have to work with a customer for the good of your company, where you might
    have not chosen to work with this customer otherwise.
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Adrian
- line: That's one of the potential next steps for a solo freelancer? When you're
    a solo freelancer, and you want to do something bigger, an agency is one of the
    options – but with all the pros and cons we discussed. The pros being having more
    money, and the cons, I guess, are all these things that you mentioned. For some,
    it might be fine, but not for everyone. Another option would be creating a product,
    right?
  sec: 721
  time: '12:01'
  who: Alexey
- header: Choosing Product Building Over Growing an Agency
- line: You could always go and do something more esoteric – that's different from
    core freelancing. You could go build a product on your own, but that sounds pretty
    risky. Or you could go down, let's say, the path of creating a company. Because
    fundamentally, I wanted to build a product. But in order to enable making that
    happen, you need to align multiple incentives with that. If I just want to build
    something by myself in isolation, for nobody's benefit, I can do that. But if
    you want things to end up in front of people, if you want them to be of a high
    quality, if you want people to help you, it's a different game. That's no longer,
    let's say, the resource drain – to make something like this happen takes more
    than the effort of one person. Also on the skills part.
  sec: 751
  time: '12:31'
  who: Adrian
- line: Okay. Usually, you don't just wake up and say, “Okay, now I quit freelancing.
    Let's try to build a product.” [Adrian agrees] It happens gradually, right? So
    there was something you saw that you were doing over and over again. Right?
  sec: 807
  time: '13:27'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Recurring Pain: Stakeholder Alignment vs Technical Setup'
- line: I was telling you about building data warehouses over and over again – that
    does get pretty old. I would say that the reason why I didn't enjoy it anymore
    – it was not really challenging. The technical challenges get simple if you've
    been a data engineer for a few years and then it's just the people problem. It's
    kind of the same problem on repeat – educating stakeholders that “total margin”
    doesn't mean anything, and you need an actual metric, educating stakeholders that
    “number of customers” means different things to different teams. I can give an
    example where I was done building a data warehouse, technically, in two weeks,
    and then we spent two months getting everyone on the same page as to what “the
    customer” is and which ones they're tracking and which ones they're reporting
    on. It was literally mind-blowing. What happened for me was, I thought, “Okay,
    I don't want to do…” The technical challenge for me was easy to solve, but what
    I realized is that it's not easy for everyone else on the team.
  sec: 822
  time: '13:42'
  who: Adrian
- line: Data engineers are often a bottleneck in organizations. What I was trying
    to do with my work of building and hiring was to always empower our others to
    take over. It wasn't a game where I wanted to be the centerpiece of data engineering
    for the next five years at this company. In order to do that, I was looking for
    easy ways in which other people can take on the engineering role. Like I said,
    I think it's a pretty low-complexity role in terms of technical requirements,
    but it's not necessarily easy to learn and to get there. If you actually have
    everything available to you, such as boilerplate code, then you could just use
    it as a data person, and you don't need all the engineering to happen. This is
    how the product idea actually came to be. Which I guess is more or less what you
    were asking, right?
  sec: 822
  time: '13:42'
  who: Adrian
- line: Well, yeah – more or less. I was curious, what exactly you saw that made you
    think, “Okay, so many companies have this problem. If I put a solution to this
    problem in a box, instead of selling my services to these companies…” You could
    say, “Okay, this is the solution and you can actually use this solution on your
    own. You don't need me to use the solution.”
  sec: 948
  time: '15:48'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Target Users: Empowering Python Users with Dev Tooling'
- line: Yeah. I can give you some examples. You have a lot of really smart people
    working in the data field right now and even more smart people not working in
    the data field and wanting to. So you have all these new-generation Python users
    that… they're brilliant – they were exposed to programming languages earlier than
    the rest of us and they've had opportunities and chances that we dream of sometimes
    that we had ourselves. They're uniquely positioned to be able to solve these kinds
    of problems, but they need the right tools, because they don't have five years
    to develop the engineering skills and learnings that it might take for a data
    engineer.
  sec: 976
  time: '16:16'
  who: Adrian
- line: What I noticed was a few patterns such as, these Python people can easily
    use Pandas, and they can get some data from an API, they can use pandas and SQL
    to load some data – fundamentally, the skills are there. It's just about the in-depth
    engineering knowledge that isn't quite there. There was another common antipattern
    – people were basically just throwing JSON strings into databases. This happens
    quite frequently. The reason why people do this is, because they have a problem
    and this is a solution. Right? No one's just being evil or shitty about code quality.
    Basically, I thought, “Okay, we need some good dev tooling to help us do what
    these people are trying to do. They're not doing things in a good way, in terms
    of engineering. [This tooling needs to] help them basically do it faster, better,
    harder, stronger.”
  sec: 976
  time: '16:16'
  who: Adrian
- header: 'Anti‑patterns: Dumping JSON into Data Warehouses'
- line: From what I heard from you… I know a bit about the product (the tool) you’re
    working on. What I heard is –when you have a data warehouse, you don't just have
    it for the sake of having it, you need to put some data in it. Then you have a
    bunch of JSON data coming from endpoints or from somewhere. Then, you need to
    take this JSON data and put it into a data warehouse or some sort of database
    and the easiest way of doing this is just to take the JSON as-is and put it to
    Postgres (because in Postgres, you have this JSON field or whatever). I think
    for all the major data warehouses, you can just put JSON data in there.
  sec: 1071
  time: '17:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can ignore it as a complex type, or you can just [audio cuts out] strings.
    [audio cuts out]
  sec: 1121
  time: '18:41'
  who: Adrian
- line: What people were doing is, naturally – you have this type, you have a bunch
    of JSON, “Hmm. The easiest way is just take the JSON and put it in the database.”
    Right? Because not everyone knows that maybe it's not the best solution, but it
    kind of works all right. So you saw that. You saw that people can actually do
    that –they can use Python – but this is not the best thing to do for a data warehouse,
    because it's expensive and you don't want to just put complex objects there because
    it's more difficult.
  sec: 1125
  time: '18:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are many problems – from cost, maintenance, robustness, and so on.
  sec: 1158
  time: '19:18'
  who: Adrian
- line: So you saw that and you thought, “Okay, what if there was a tool that could
    just easily enable them to do that? Then, instead of having a bunch of JSON fields
    in the database, they have something proper.” Right?
  sec: 1163
  time: '19:23'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'DLT Concept: Declarative JSON→Relational Transformation'
- line: Yeah. Basically, databases like type flat tables. For example, JSON doesn't
    have date/time, so when you load JSON to a database, you're creating a date/time
    string, kind of. You're just creating strings. Then somebody has to come and say,
    “This is a timestamp. Let me extract it from the JSON. Let me give it the right
    type. Now we can actually use it.” So I tried to kind of jump over these steps
    so we don't have to have a human that is manually guessing what each data type
    is and unpacking this data and making it clean. Basically, this tool that I was
    working on facilitates just taking unknown JSON data and putting it in a tabular
    relational format in the database.
  sec: 1178
  time: '19:38'
  who: Adrian
- line: I say “relational” because JSON can have sub-structures, such as lists, within
    the JSON, which you cannot represent within a simple type. You need to either
    break it out into a new table, or keep it as some kind of array. Databases like
    tables, not arrays. This is kind of the idea – it just makes it easy. You have,
    let's say, declarative ways of loading – I can replace, I can append, I can upsert
    or merge the data. You also have a lot of tweaks that data engineers care about.
    I won't really go into a lot of details here about that, but… you put the JSON
    in the database, but the data engineer will worry about, “Okay, what's the distribution
    key? What are the primary key performance considerations? Maybe I want the data
    contract.” Things like that.
  sec: 1178
  time: '19:38'
  who: Adrian
- line: From what I heard – you said that people who are not necessarily experienced
    data engineers, but know some Python, can just take these JSONs and throw them
    into the data warehouse. But also, if I'm an experienced data engineer, this is
    kind of repetitive – I have this bunch of JSON files or JSON data and then I have
    to parse them and think, “Okay, for this, because it's nested, I need to create
    this table in this table. This is a one-to-many relationship.” And then you spend
    a week messing with JSON structures and creating a table structure, and then doing
    all the mapping.
  sec: 1280
  time: '21:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Even if you have experience, it's kind of repetitive. Then you join another
    company, and then you have the same problem. Then you join another company as
    a freelancer, and, again, they have the same problem. So it feels super repetitive,
    right? Because you need to do the same thing over and over again. Even if you
    do it correctly, as a data engineer, you still end up doing a lot of stuff again,
    and again.
  sec: 1280
  time: '21:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, and ultimately, correctly, it's a matter of best guess, right? Because
    when you're referring to types from a weakly-typed data like JSON, you could be
    wrong. There's nothing preventing JSON from sending you a number today, and a
    string tomorrow – JSON internally doesn't have any kind of type consistency between
    records. You want something that also reduces maintenance, because we can guess
    what the data is, but we might find out that we are wrong two days later, when
    the data doesn't load. We don't want to do that. The more data you have, the more
    you try to avoid this, typically, and you try to curate it upfront, which generates
    a whole another set of problems. Now you have to talk to stakeholders and people
    and it takes so much longer.
  sec: 1344
  time: '22:24'
  who: Adrian
- line: Was it born when you saw this pattern and you wanted to solve this problem
    for clients faster? That's why you created this tool? Or was it that you realized
    that there is a pattern, you stopped freelancing, and you focused on the tool?
  sec: 1391
  time: '23:11'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Product Iteration: Engine, Abstractions, and User Feedback'
- line: It's a little more complex than that. I was already building some kind of
    data loading tool before – it's called Growth Full Stack. It's something like
    Fivetran for a specific vertical. There, I had the pleasure of playing with the
    concept a little bit. Okay, you have the side of what the right way for taking
    something to people so they can use it is, and then you have the building side
    of how it could be and how it should be. I would say it took me some time to actually
    formulate some stronger opinions about how it could be built. Once we started
    building it, there are multiple layers of abstractions of how you could build
    something like this – it could be built in a way that engineers love, or it could
    be built in a way that any Python person can understand.
  sec: 1410
  time: '23:30'
  who: Adrian
- line: Usually, to reach these good abstractions – you might have some ideas, but
    they're not going to be the best. Right? You want to validate them. We did a kind
    of incremental process, where we first built an engine, and with this engine,
    we started building pipelines, getting people's feedback, seeing what people could
    do or couldn't do. Then, we figured out that we need to simplify this and created
    another layer of abstraction on top, to enable the Python users to just easily
    use this.
  sec: 1410
  time: '23:30'
  who: Adrian
- line: You said, “Once we started building it,” you used “we”. Who are “we”? Who
    are you talking about? You and some other people?
  sec: 1493
  time: '24:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Me and the co-founders, yes. Should I talk about them or?
  sec: 1504
  time: '25:04'
  who: Adrian
- line: Yeah, I'm just curious – you were a freelancer, I guess you've worked with
    other freelancers, but how did you two meet? How did you actually find each other
    and decide, “Okay, let's focus on solving this problem.”?
  sec: 1509
  time: '25:09'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Team Formation: Meeting Co‑founders Through Projects'
- line: So it's a classic story – we met at work. On my last project, the guy that
    hired me had been working for this company for six years. He had previously founded
    some companies. And basically, I ended up working with him to build this Growth
    Full Stack solution that I mentioned. So we actually had one year of working together.
    We had also worked together on some smaller projects before. I went with him on
    a consulting and sales trip to Poland, for example, to sell this data engineering
    solution. I kind of realized, “Okay, I can work with this person. We can communicate
    well, and this person (I'll just call him Matt, because his name is Matt).”
  sec: 1523
  time: '25:23'
  who: Adrian

    wouldn't have jumped headfirst into all of this founding chaos without some kind
    of guidance. So this was a good opportunity. The rest of my team are basically
    people with whom Matt has founded before. There's Martin, who's our technical
    genius – who basically very much likes to hack things and figure out the simplest
    ways (and the most elegant ways or esoteric ways sometimes). There is also Anna,
    who joined in a more limited capacity, originally, to just help us with operations
    – registering the company, talking to the lawyers, figuring out all these kinds
    of things.

    that this is the right thing to do – before starting a company? How did you decide
    that this is what you actually want to do? Like, “Let's start a company. Let's
    start getting money. Let's start hiring people?” Because it's a big investment,
    right?

- header: 'Founding as Investment: Time, Risk, and Opportunity Cost'
- line: Yeah, it's a big investment and it's a complex decision. I would say, for
    myself, I looked at it from an entrepreneurial perspective. I thought, “Okay,
    I'm a freelancer. There's so much that can be done with freelancing. I want to
    invest more.” As a freelancer, you actually get to earn a lot of money, and I
    had the opportunity to learn about investments. And when you are investing, there
    are multiple tiers of risk that you could take. You could buy a house and rent
    it out and make maybe 1% per year. Or you could buy an apartment, and make maybe
    3% per year. Or maybe you invest in the stock market, you take more chances, and
    you might earn more. Or if you want to really go crazy, you could go into angel
    investing, which is very high risk and high reward. Sometimes it has a return
    of maybe 30% per year, statistically. And the next step would be founding, where
    you go all-in on something that's quite high risk. Of course, it’s also possibly
    high rewards.
  sec: 1659
  time: '27:39'
  who: Adrian
- line: This is, in a way, my way of investing in a way that I was able to. In another
    way, because I met Matt, and this team, it was kind of the perfect opportunity
    to go down a path that they were already familiar with, making things much easier
    to get it right. Also, having worked with them before, I had the understanding
    that this is a group of people that I can work with. Because probably when founding
    – when choosing co-founders, one of the most important things is that it's kind
    of like a family, in the sense that now you're bound together for the next six
    years or something. Then you will always need to figure out solutions to problems.
    If you don't, your problems will only grow. So I knew that this is the right team
    to do it with.

- line: The word “investing” that I used when asking you that question, I meant more
    like time investing. But that’s interesting – it's interesting that you came from

    or just starting a company.

    but more like, “Okay, this is the next thing I will do.” But also, you need to
    kind of push money there… well not kind of, but you actually have to put money

    Then, there's your cost of living, which I would say is a moderate concern, in
    the sense that it's one of the costs that you will incur. Then there is the cost
    of company operation, because ultimately, you will want to do something with that
    company, and just keeping it with some money in the bank and not spending that
    money doesn't actually get you anywhere. What you want to do is invest and have
    access to build things. So you also want to get some money into the company. What
    we did was literally for one year, we didn't actually have a job or a salary.
    We just lived on savings. One of the advantages was that the cost of living in
    Berlin is not too high. It's manageable, if you manage to save up a little bit.

    was like, “I had a plan and I’m definitely not able to stick to it.” So it was
    definitely a little bit stressful. Luckily, there was still work to be found in
    the markets. So, at least we were able to earn money into the company a little
    bit to fund our operations. We basically, as I told you, first we built an engine.
    We use this engine with design partners, which also paid us for the work. We were
    able to get some feedback and also a little bit of funding for our company.

    you provided services to them?
  sec: 1982
  time: '33:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. It was kind of like freelancing in the sense that I was actually
    the only one directly involved in these projects, mostly. The difference, I would
    say, for me, is that somebody else was issuing the invoice for some other entity,
    mostly. But what was happening was – we got to actually test our tool with real
    data and we also had some really good learnings, which potentially couldn't be
    worth more in the prospect of a company building, with the little money that we
    got from these consulting teams.
  sec: 1999

    you earn some money from this activity – when you consult, and then you get money,
    and you keep money in the company to fund yourself (to pay your and other people’s

    the financial situation was changing, so a lot of companies basically – investors
    invested in them, let's say, 40X their yearly revenue value, where 20x would be
    normal. So when the “mini-crash,” let’s call it, came, lots of investors basically
    either halved the investment or doubled the goal to get back on track. And what
    this did was, companies were forced to let go of half of their staff. Unfortunately
    for them, but fortunately for us, there were lots of, let's say, empty rooms around
    Berlin offices at the time. We were able to use these rooms without paying for
    rent, which was super [cross-talk]

    a salary. Because that wouldn't have been realistically possible. The pressure
    did increase at some point and we had to raise a pre-seed round. This was happening
    around the time when we were also creating a workshop for validation. I think
    you remember about that one because I was asking you if I can recruit some testers
    from your Slack group.

    we wanted to figure out how to make a better interface for this engine that any
    Python user could use. Around that time, we were actually already raising the
    pre-seed round. It was quite chaotic, but we created this three-day workshop,
    “How to build a pipeline in six hours (two hours a day),” and we had some 60 people
    join us. To our amazement, they were all able to build an incremental pipeline.
    Back then, it was Twitter API, and now there is no more Twitter and there's no
    more free API either. Different times. But then, we realized, “Okay, we have success
    with this interface. This is what people can use and are willing to use and learn.
    It's a shallow-enough learning curve that people will just use it.”
  sec: 2160

    give you feedback on the tool, but more to learn how to actually build pipelines,
    right? [Adrian agrees] You showed them how to do this, but you also learned from
    how they use it. Can you tell us more about this learning experience? How did
    you actually design the workshop in such a way that it was helpful for you and
    not just for the attendees?

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Workshop Design: Checkpoints, Live Support, and CodeSpaces'

    of measuring. But one of the challenges was – when you're teaching, it's also
    hard to get live feedback from people, so I don't know how you manage it. But
    we figured that we actually need two people when teaching this course – one is
    teaching and the other is actually watching what the people are doing and helping.
    We have checkpoints. For every day, we had something like 20 checkpoints. We split
    the two hours into 10 segments and we were asking people to react on Slack to
    the checkpoint message to say, “Okay, if everyone has managed to do this step,
    please give an emoji to this Slack message.” This way we could actually see how
    many people have done it.

    part of the task).” Right?
  sec: 2318

    to get live help, if they had some errors. One important aspect (speaking of errors)
    was actually preparing the workshop in an environment that's the same for everyone.
    We basically created a Code Spaces environment where everything was the same.
    So we had a pre–

  time: '39:14'
  who: Adrian
- line: Oh, you had Code Spaces? We should use that for our courses, too. Usually,
    we just say “Okay, just run an instance. This is how you configure stuff on that
    instance.” Then some of the students came up with this idea of, “Hmm… We can use
    Code Spaces.” They took initiative. So what you did was realized, “Okay, this
    thing is free, (or it costs something, but not much) and everyone has the same
    environment.” That's smart. The task was to get some JSON data from Twitter and
    build a warehouse from this data. Right?
  sec: 2379
  time: '39:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was basically to get the data from Twitter. The people that we were teaching
    were just Python users, so many had not actually done a web request. So it was
    also teaching them to extract the data, with authentication, pagination, concerns
    – so it was teaching best practices of how to do this, and also using the tool
    itself.

- line: Yes. It's pretty simple. It's called Data Load Tool (DLT for short). I often
    like to tell people, “Don't think of it as a data loading tool, think of it as
    a pipeline building tool.” And the reason for this is because it's a developer
    tool made for developers to build pipelines easily. While it does load data, it
    does so because you built the pipeline.

- line: Yes. Basically, at that point, we had just created this simple interface on
    top of the engine. But what is DLT, ultimately? A product is kind of a moving
    target. What we didn't have at the time were docs. You can imagine that without
    docs our product is unusable. I would say docs are just as much part of the product
    as the code itself. At that point, it was more like a research phase – it was
    very early.

    Was it…

  time: '41:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: We learned less than we were hoping to. We were expecting that people would
    have problems with various parts of the workshop and it turned out that there
    were no problems. What we did learn was that this was a good abstraction for people
    to use, that it was really easy to understand, and the next step was to create
    docs that allow people to actually understand what’s happening and use it.
  sec: 2521
  time: '42:01'
  who: Adrian
- line: I see – because creating docs is a big investment. Because once you have the
    docs, and you change something in the tool, you need to redo all the docs. What
    you wanted to check was if the tool (the abstractions) you came up with were good
    enough so you could start building the docs. [Adrian agrees] How would you know
    that you need to do it this way?
  sec: 2551
  time: '42:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's not only about knowing. It's also… You're limited in bandwidth. There's
    only so much you can do. I can tell you that it probably took us three months
    before our docs were actually at a level where people were able to use them and
    another three months before they were the level where people were saying, “Hey,
    your docs are pretty good!” Yeah, we had quite a bit of negative feedback.

    now because there were some checkpoints where many people struggled, or, as it
    turned out, there were no problems with the actual code. For you, this was a good
    signal that, “Okay, now it's time to invest in docs.” Right?

    fit – which I guess I will also have to explain what that is – usually, you keep
    going towards product market fit. Product market fit is basically a point where
    your product fits the needs of the market. You can generally tell by increasing
    adoption and people really wanting to use it. They say that one way to determine
    if you have product market fit is to take the solution away and see if anyone
    cries. If nobody cries, you don''t have product market fit.'

  time: '44:34'
  who: Alexey

    at the core of things. For example, we have an early adopter that decided to run
    the entire organization on DLT – the entire data stack – so if you take it away,
    they're gonna have to figure out how to do something else, but it would be a big
    pain, because it currently solves a lot of problems.

  sec: 2717
  time: '45:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on who you are and how you perceive risk, right? If you're a software
    engineer and you can analyze the code base that is open source, and you decide
    that this is something that looks good to you, that meets your criteria, then
    it's easy to make a decision. Because if something goes wrong, you can maintain
    this and you can keep using this, it's not just [audio cuts out].
  sec: 2735
  time: '45:35'
  who: Adrian
- line: This thing is easier than writing from scratch, right? You can just keep a
    copy of the code in your internal GitLab, whatever, and it's still easier than
    building a similar thing from scratch. Engineers saw value in that, because they
    can just open this thing and see, “Okay. Makes sense.” And then just use it.
  sec: 2759
  time: '45:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: But if you're the kind of person who's rather a tool user – if you use a tool
    like Segment, for example – where you expect that everything is done for you and
    you just pay for it, then this would be too early-stage for such a market.
  sec: 2783
  time: '46:23'
  who: Adrian

    the management doesn't care – as long as the problem is solved, it’s okay.
  sec: 2799
  time: '46:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Also, it depends on the engineer. Because if the engineer can handle
    the code base on their own, then they don't have a problem. But if you expect
    something to happen in the future to the open source project, then it might not
    be a good bet.

    to happen next – figure out some kind of way to do it – and then try to get help
    to do more of it in a better way, if that pays off, kind of. So I'm doing a lot
    of things that are not in my strengths. I’m kind of inventing what we should be
    doing. But I'm not trying to reinvent any flat tires. I'm taking lots of cues
    from other people in the industry. To be specific about what I'm doing right now
    – I'm actually heading the go-to-market strategy for our library, which means
    communicating… You could call it marketing, in a way that helps the end-user understand
    about your product and that is aligned with the strategy. Specifically, our strategy
    is to go for bottom-up adoption. We don't want to be the solution that your non-Data
    Manager is buying, because they think it builds them a warehouse and bakes them
    a cake. We want to be that actual developer tool that you will come across and

    myself.”

    how do you reach audiences? You could go to where these audiences hang out, for
    example, on Reddit, or a data engineering Subreddit, or on your Slack group, or
    you could go to other tool groups that these people use. Right? If you go to this
    other tool group, you want to figure out, “Okay, do we have a use case that this
    audience is interested in?” Then you kind of need to figure out what they're doing,
    what they like, how they think, what problems they have, and then offer them a
    solution for that so they can relate to the content and maybe try it.

    with DocDB and I guess this is a good example of other tool groups. You can just
    hang out in the DocDB Slack and see what kind of problems people have, and see
    if DLT can solve some of these problems, right? And if it can't, then what do
    you actually do? Do you say, “Hey, have a look at DLT?” Or do you just take note

    we're a library that runs in a notebook, and so are they, this means that we have
    the opportunity to run together in places where data pipelines and data engineers
    previously didn't go. This means we can, for example, create a simple demo on
    a Colab that just runs. It enables lots of easy testing and easy adoption for
    us. Also for development, right? Because DLT will generate schemas before the
    database. So if it's DocDB or something else, like BigQuery, DLT doesn't care
    – you will have the same schema. You can literally go for development between
    DocDB and something else. That event – we didn't do any content there, we just
    posted it. But we have a DocDB destination, we have another doc destination, and
    we are kind of their recommended solution for loading, which is helping.

  sec: 3130
  time: '52:10'
  who: Adrian
- line: You said that this is the recommended solution. It means that somewhere in
    the documents, they mention something like “If you have a specific use case (this
    specific problem) use DLT.”
  sec: 3132
  time: '52:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I think it is there somewhere, maybe in… I don't know if we're actually
    mentioned in the documentation. But they did distribute us to their audience in
    the newsletter, for example. We have some demos we did together. [cross-talk]
  sec: 3141
  time: '52:21'
  who: Adrian
- line: How did you convince them to do this? This is interesting. What you have is
    a mutually beneficial… partnership? If I may say it this way. They help you because
    you can run both things locally, so you don't need to set up BigQuery, or whatever.
    And then for them, you solve some of their problems – then they can easily see
    the benefits of DocDB. So how did you find this partnership? How did you actually…
    not convince them, but how did they end up doing this mention? Did you ask them,
    “Hey, can you feature us in the newsletter?” Or did they want to do this themselves?
    Or how did it work?
  sec: 3161

  who: Alexey
- line: You can think about this like dating? How do you move on from dating to marriage?
    It's a process. It's not a one-off point, right? I would say it was incremental.
    Partly, we just added DocDB because it was beneficial for us, so we added it as
    a destination. We started using it in our demos. Then we came to them and told
    them “Hey, guys. Look. It's a super useful solution for us and we also align with
    your product principles. One of them is being anti-platform – just being a library
    that doesn't plan to take over your entire stack.” This worked very well also
    with DocDB because what this means, if you're not trying to take over things,
    it means you're trying to integrate into things. It means that you can have healthy
    partnerships with the rest of the ecosystem, which DocDB also does very well.

  who: Adrian
- line: Okay. So what are your plans for the future?
  sec: 3265
  time: '54:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: We are almost done closing the fundraising round. This will open a new chapter
    in the life of our company and that chapter will include working on a paid solution.
    I was telling you about the go-to-market fit. What you want to do before you take
    money is find product market fit. Because if you don't do that, investors don't
    care about your product market fit – they care about outgrowth.
  sec: 3269
  time: '54:29'
  who: Adrian
- line: They give you money because they want to get more money in return. If they
    don't see how their money will multiply, then they will not give you the money,
    right?
  sec: 3302
  time: '55:02'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Roadmap: Paid Complement to the Open‑Source Library'
- line: Yes, it's very hard to raise money for just research, right? Basically, we
    have got a product market fit with our library. Now we're working towards a paid
    solution. That paid solution would be something complimentary. It wouldn't limit
    the library in any way, it would rather add to it. Right now, we're basically
    working on user research to better figure out what the solution could be. We have,
    of course, some strong ideas, but we want to validate them before we just go out
    and build things. There are some other, let's say, open problems in the library
    space. One of them is taking contributions – this is a hard problem.
  sec: 3310
  time: '55:10'
  who: Adrian
- line: Basically, a community scales differently than a company. There can be a lot
    more people in the community, but if you are open to contributions, and they have
    to go through some company process, you end up being a bottleneck. This wouldn't
    work, basically. It would put a lot of burden on us that we wouldn't be able to
    take at the moment. How to solve this problem? Maybe LLMs will be involved in
    the future. The other problem that could be solved for a library would be – a
    lot of people just want sources. They don't want to build a pipeline from scratch.
    It's actually possible to generate many of these sources. But it's, again, not
    a very easy problem – not for everything. It's also raising questions of utility,
    maintenance, distribution, and so on. So maybe [cross-talk]
  sec: 3310
  time: '55:10'
  who: Adrian
- line: By that you mean – let's say there's the Twitter API (well, it existed)… Let’s
    say GitHub API. Then what we say is, “You select GitHub as a source somewhere,
    you select destination DocDB.” And then that's kind of it, right? You don't do
    anything.
  sec: 3411
  time: '56:51'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Source Generation Experiments: OpenAPI Generators for Pipelines'
- line: Yeah. We've done several experiments in this direction. One of them is – there's
    an open API standard. You might have heard of Swagger, for example – Swagger tools
    for API's. Basically, in this open API specification, you have almost all the
    information you need to wrap an API. You can generate the entire pipeline code
    from the specification. We actually have them on our website, where our CTO does
    that from the Pokemon pipeline. And the generator is quite smart. It's only Python
    rule-based, there's no LLM involved. But it will do things like, for example,
    understand that, “this is a list resource, and this is a detail resource, and
    you first need to list, and then get the detail for this entity,” or something
    like that.
  sec: 3430
  time: '57:10'
  who: Adrian
- line: So it puts you in competition with tools like Airbyte, right?
  sec: 3476
  time: '57:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I would say they're a distant competitor.
  sec: 3480
  time: '58:00'
  who: Adrian
- line: It’s what they do – they have a bunch of sources, a bunch of destinations,
    and then they connect them.
  sec: 3485
  time: '58:05'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Positioning vs Platforms: Library‑First vs Airbyte/Fivetran'
- line: We don't really want to go… Airbyte is a platform. We’ll never be a platform
    in that way. Even if we do offer some kind of orchestration, that is not our selling
    point. We don't want to be another Fivetran. Airbyte, currently, is kind of trying
    to be another Fivetran. There is a question of product market fit. Who's going
    to be building and maintaining these pipelines? I would say we don't really compete
    with Airbyte in that way, because their builder is a UI-focused person. On the
    programming side, it's really hard to build with Airbyte. We also don't want to
    put this source building necessarily on the community, if not needed. There are
    multiple ways in which you can do this – I was telling you about the open API
    standard, but there's also LLMs used for generating. Here, we're actually uniquely
    positioned as well because if you use GPT with DLT docs, you can pretty easily
    get a pipeline just by asking for it. This is possible because it's a library.
    If this was some kind of monolithic application, it would be much harder.
  sec: 3491
  time: '58:11'
  who: Adrian
- line: Do you have time for one more question? [Adrian agrees] Can you recommend
    any resource, book, or course, or something to our listeners about this topic?
    If somebody wants to start what you did – create a product, (an open source product)
    where can they learn?
  sec: 3569
  time: '59:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: So unfortunately, there are no major simple resources that give you everything
    you need, but I can recommend reading about go-to-market and product market fit.
    I read this book called From Survival to Thrival, the Enterprise Product Market
    Fit, which describes how you can go from a startup to building an enterprise-ready
    product, kind of. For me as a data engineer, I never thought about things that
    way. It was just a very big eye-opener for me to understand that these topics
    exist, and I should consider them. I cannot necessarily recommend the book as
    being The authority, but it's definitely good to educate yourself on what is out
    there.
  sec: 3590

  sec: 3641
  time: '1:00:41'
  who: Alexey

    product market fit.

    minutes than we should have. Thanks a lot for joining us today and sharing your
    experience. I'm really curious. I think the last time we had an interview was
    two years ago – maybe slightly less. We should definitely meet again, maybe in
    a year and a half or two, and see what changed. [Adrian agrees] Yeah, that would
    be pretty interesting. Okay. So thanks again for joining us today. And thanks,
    everyone, for joining us today, too. Have a great week ahead.
