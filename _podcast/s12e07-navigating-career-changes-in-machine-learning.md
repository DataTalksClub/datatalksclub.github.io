short: Navigating Career Changes in Machine Learning
title: Navigating Career Changes in Machine Learning
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about quite a few things – building a machine learning
    platform, career, being a generalist or specialist – quite a wide range of topics.
    We have a special guest today, Krysztof (Chris). So Krysztof is a seasoned engineer
    with 17 years of professional experience in building software. Currently, he works
    at Zalando, where he's supporting machine learning practitioners as a machine
    learning platform engineer.
  sec: 70
  time: '1:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, maybe you know that Chris gave a talk about that a few months ago,
    where he presented the machine learning platform they built at Zalando. We will
    include the link in the notes, so if you haven't seen it, check it out. It's in
    our channel too. Right now Chris is on a sabbatical, where he is learning and
    broadening his machine learning skills. Welcome. Pleasure to have you here again.
  sec: 70
  time: '1:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hello, everyone. Hi, Alex.
  sec: 129
  time: '2:09'
  who: Chris
- header: Chris’s background
- line: The questions for today’s interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks,
    Johanna, for your help. Let's start. We'll start with your background. Can you
    tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 132
  time: '2:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. It started quite a while ago. In 2000, I built my first website and since
    then, in 2005, I started to work as a software engineer. I worked in pharma for
    a company called Roche. This was my first job as a software engineer, specializing
    in front end. Then I work for a company that some of you have fond memories of,
    called Nokia. I was working there on geolocation services, also working mostly
    front end and map applications and navigation.
  sec: 145
  time: '2:25'
  who: Chris
- line: Then I decided to switch my career to something completely different and got
    into game development. I was working for a company called Wooga. It's a Berlin-based
    startup, a wonderful place where I spent five years working on mobile games, for
    example, for iOS. I also built again, for this device [shows watch] for Apple
    Watch. It still runs on my device.
  sec: 145
  time: '2:25'
  who: Chris
- line: You can actually play games on the Apple Watch?
  sec: 204
  time: '3:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that was one of the things we wanted to try out. And it's definitely
    possible. So the games are running even now,
  sec: 207
  time: '3:27'
  who: Chris
- line: Do people actually play it? I guess it's not really convenient to use it?
    Or is it?
  sec: 213
  time: '3:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Part of the experiment was to find out if it is a good platform for games.
    It is possible, but there are only certain kinds of games you can build for it
    that make sense. For example, so-called “idle” games, where you do something and
    then you wait, and in a while your watch will remind you to play. It was more
    like a proof of concept.
  sec: 219
  time: '3:39'
  who: Chris
- line: So you cannot really play Tetris or Bubble Witch or anything like that?
  sec: 239
  time: '3:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think Tetris would be possible if it's a simplified version, but maybe not
    the most convenient.
  sec: 243
  time: '4:03'
  who: Chris
- line: Okay, interesting.
  sec: 248
  time: '4:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: And then after Wooga, I decided to switch careers again and joined Zalando.
    Zalando is a company where it's quite easy to switch between different roles and
    the company encourages that. I started as a full stack engineer working mostly
    with Python and then I moved towards data in the first team. In that area, I was
    working on data governance topics for one year. Then, three years ago, I reached
    my current destination, which is machine learning. I joined the machine learning
    platform team where I was working as a software engineer and now as the internal
    consultant.
  sec: 251
  time: '4:11'
  who: Chris
- line: You started your career, I guess, with HTML and a bit of JavaScript, right?
    [Chris agrees] You built your first website, I guess maybe with some PHP. Right?
  sec: 289
  time: '4:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: PHP and the very first language I started with was Perl, if you remember that
    one.
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Chris
- line: Perl. I know it existed – still exists – and every time I copy a snippet from
    the internet with some Perl code, my brain just explodes. I don't know how people
    in their right mind can write this. [chuckles] I hopefully did not offend any
    Perl lovers. I know they exist. It’s not for me, I guess. [chuckles]
  sec: 302
  time: '5:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: I actually really like Perl. It has a reputation of – some people call it
    “write-only language,” because you can write it but then it's not very easy to
    read.
  sec: 323
  time: '5:23'
  who: Chris
- line: “You live only once language.” [chuckles]
  sec: 330
  time: '5:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 331
  time: '5:31'
  who: Chris
- line: So then it was Pearl, and then you joined Nokia. What kind of stack did you
    use at Nokia? I guess Java or something like that?
  sec: 334
  time: '5:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: At Nokia, I was working on the front end applications that were running in
    a browser, both on mobile and on desktop. We were using JavaScript.
  sec: 339
  time: '5:39'
  who: Chris
- line: JavaScript, right. So you weren't writing any mobile code, only the front
    end.
  sec: 349
  time: '5:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: At the time, at Nokia, yes – it was only JavaScript. Actually, this was also
    the reason I was hired for this gaming company, Wooga, because we also tried to
    do mobile development using JavaScript. The first project was in JavaScript, and
    only later we decided it's better to use something native or Unity.
  sec: 354
  time: '5:54'
  who: Chris
- line: You were talking about Wooga, [Chris agrees] as a game developer you used
    Unity there.
  sec: 374
  time: '6:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: I didn't use anything myself. When I was there, it was a very exciting time
    because Wooga was trying different technology. We started with HTML5, which was
    a big thing at the time, around 2012. We built and shipped again, but we decided
    it's not really the most convenient and performant tool for mobile development,
    so we switched to native. I was mostly working there with Objective C and Swift.
    And then the company moved to Unity. But around that time, I also left and moved
    to Zalando.
  sec: 384
  time: '6:24'
  who: Chris
- line: And then at Zalando, as a full stack engineer, you said that you used Python.
  sec: 418
  time: '6:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Mostly Python, yes.
  sec: 424
  time: '7:04'
  who: Chris
- header: Switching careers multiple times
- line: From what I hear, these are completely different stacks. So how did you change
    your career so many times? How did you convince the employers to actually give
    you a chance?
  sec: 425
  time: '7:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, this is an interesting question because sometimes when companies are
    hiring people, they look for experts and specialists in one area. But in practice,
    pretty much in every place I worked at, it turned out that in the end, the company
    is changing direction and they actually want people to learn new things. In every
    place, I was fortunate that the company allowed me to try something new and learn.
    At Wooga, the company decided to change direction, but they were happy with me
    as a general purpose software engineer and I was also very eager to get deeper
    into Apple’s stack. I got a few weeks to just get into the new codebase and then
    you just grow expertise as you're building software.
  sec: 443
  time: '7:23'
  who: Chris
- line: As I understood, you joined Wooga as a JavaScript developer – or front end
    developer [Chris agrees] – but then there was a chance to work on mobile stuff.
    And you took this chance, right?
  sec: 490
  time: '8:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I was already hired with the intention to work on mobile development
    with JavaScript. The project was already going on. But then we decided that we
    actually don't want to continue working with JavaScript – we wanted to use native
    tech because it just performs better.
  sec: 500
  time: '8:20'
  who: Chris
- line: You were using Objective C and Swift and then somehow you ended up as a full
    stack engineer using Python. How did that happen?
  sec: 518
  time: '8:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Web was always very close to me and even though I mostly specialized
    in front end, even for my own private projects, I already did some back end. For
    example, I did PHP, Perl, which I mentioned, and also Ruby on Rails. I had the
    general idea, which was good enough to get me through the interviews. In the interviews
    at Zalando, I had to use JavaScript. But then the project also required Python
    knowledge. Then, at Zalando, I remember I forced myself to have a very quick learning
    experience with Python. I read some books about this, and started to code also
    in my spare time.
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Chris
- line: Very quickly, I was able to contribute. Also, what's worth adding is that
    a lot of experience as a generalist can transfer it from one tech stack to another.
    This was a very common theme in my career, for example, things such as SQL – one
    of the technologies that I used pretty much in every company, even though it was
    not always my expertise. Learning Git is also something that I just keep using
    over and over in every role.
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Chris
- header: Freedom at companies
- line: When you mentioned Zalando, I remember my interview with Zalando. Actually,
    I was interviewing for a data scientist position and I was asked algorithmic challenges,
    but I could use whatever language I wanted. My background was in Java development
    before data science, so for me, it was the easiest to use Java, and they were
    like, “Okay, whatever. Use what you want.” They didn't really test me for knowledge
    in a specific language. They just wanted to see how I could solve problems. I
    guess this is what also happened to you. In the interview they just check that
    you know some things and then maybe they didn't care much whether you know Python
    or very well or not. Right?
  sec: 606
  time: '10:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's right. Specifically at Zalando, we have something called “Tech Radar,”
    which is an idea that I think was initially invented by Thoughtworks, which is
    a consulting company. It's a map of different languages, libraries, and tech tools
    that we're using in the company. I don't know in what year you applied to Zalando.
    Do you remember when it was?
  sec: 654
  time: '10:54'
  who: Chris
- line: I don't know – seven, six years ago. But I had multiple interviews with them
    across years.
  sec: 683
  time: '11:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: We have changed it a bit since then. When I was applying, it was six years
    ago. Zalando gave much more freedom to teams to choose pretty much any language
    that the team wanted. Since then, we realized this leads to a bit of chaos when,
    for example, we have a team that uses Haskell and then another team is using Rust.
    It doesn't scale very well, although it gives you that freedom. Since then, we
    focus on preparing this Tech Radar, which has a list of languages that are encouraged
    in the company.
  sec: 689
  time: '11:29'
  who: Chris
- line: Right now the list is more limited. Java is definitely still there – Python,
    JavaScript, TypeScript, for mobile development, I think Swift is there. I'm not
    sure because I'm not doing that anymore. But the list is definitely more limited
    than before. You will still have freedom, and most likely you will try and work
    with different languages, but the list is not unlimited as it was before.
  sec: 689
  time: '11:29'
  who: Chris
- line: So if you're a Haskell enthusiast, maybe it's not the right place for you,
    right? [chuckles]
  sec: 751
  time: '12:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm pretty sure we still have some legacy Haskell code, but it's not encouraged
    anymore.
  sec: 756
  time: '12:36'
  who: Chris
- line: Yeah, I wonder why. [chuckles]
  sec: 763
  time: '12:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: I got to know one person at Zalando (actually, he was even interviewing me)
    who is a huge Haskell fan. But it’s difficult to hire people who know Haskell.
    That’s one of the reasons.
  sec: 767
  time: '12:47'
  who: Chris
- header: Chris’s role as an internal consultant
- line: Okay. So you joined Zalando as a full stack engineer, then you worked in data
    governance, and then eventually switched to the ML platform as a software engineer,
    right? [Chris agrees] Can you tell us more about what you do in this ML platform
    team? Or you did, right? Now you said you’re an internal consultant. Maybe you
    can just tell us about your journey from that part in more detail.
  sec: 779
  time: '12:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's still the same team – ML platform team – but within that team, we have
    three smaller sub-teams or groups. I was first working as a software engineer,
    and the primary product of my team was something called the zflow. It's a Python
    library that we're using as a base building block for machine learning pipelines.
    I spent two years doing that. Last year, I switched roles a bit.
  sec: 805
  time: '13:25'
  who: Chris
- line: I still stayed within the ML platform team, but now as a consultant. I teach
    people how to use zflow. For example, I conduct trainings, and I also do a lot
    of user support and consulting in a way of understanding user problems and then
    helping them to architecture their pipelines and solve any issues they may have,
    either with our products, or with AWS tooling, which is another building block
    for us.
  sec: 805
  time: '13:25'
  who: Chris
- line: So how did you end up being a consultant? Is it something where you saw that
    data scientists do not know how to use zflow and then you saw the need to teach
    them? Or how did it happen?
  sec: 863
  time: '14:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: We had a consulting team from early on. The reason for that is that very often,
    with internal products, you build something but it's not very well supported.
    We wanted to avoid this mistake and that's why, from the very beginning, we put
    a lot of effort into things such as documentation, which is another thing that
    the consulting team helps with – training and onboarding, and then user support.
    We didn't want to just launch it and hope that people will use it and like it.
    We want these users to be happy with the product. That's why we have the consulting
    team. I must say that I like this a lot.
  sec: 874
  time: '14:34'
  who: Chris
- line: I like solving problems. And I must say, as an engineer working on zflow,
    I understood some parts of it very deeply, but I didn't have the big picture.
    I didn't know how people are using zflow and what the challenges they had were.
    It definitely also expanded my horizons and let me learn new things. Some people
    say that the best way to learn something new is to teach it. So that was definitely
    the case with it.
  sec: 874
  time: '14:34'
  who: Chris
- line: I also like saying that. [chuckles] That's true, I think. So what does your
    day look like as a consultant? What do you usually do?
  sec: 948
  time: '15:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Most of it is user support. It's a kind of a responsive role. We have
    several chats where we answer questions. Sometimes the questions are quite easy
    to answer, but usually not. If someone comes to us, it means that they probably
    already checked our documentation and they have a more advanced problem, which
    requires going a bit deeper. Because we work mostly remotely, usually I just get
    a call with the member of a team who has this problem and we debug it together.
    That's one thing. Very often, if I see that it's a problem that happens over and
    over again, or maybe one that resulted from a lack of clarity in our documentation,
    I would just fix the documentation.
  sec: 959
  time: '15:59'
  who: Chris
- line: Sometimes, there is a bug discovered in the process. If it's something small,
    even as a consultant, I will try to fix it. But usually, I will just talk to the
    development team and they will fix it. We also have trainings. Some trainings
    are already happening and there is quite a lot of work involved with that because
    it's not only a passive presentation, but we try to do it in a very interactive
    way. People have to do their homework and they have to prepare, and then, during
    the training they have exercises and I will also try to follow up with them later
    if they struggle with the homework, for example – you take on an instance. That's
    the typical set of tasks I have to do.
  sec: 959
  time: '15:59'
  who: Chris
- line: I guess you need to prepare all the materials for the trainings, too? [Chris
    agrees] How much of what you do is hands-on? I mean, how often do you actually
    need to go and code?
  sec: 1057
  time: '17:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not so much, I must say. I think this is a bit of a disadvantage that I don't
    code, especially when it comes to more complex problems – I can't solve them anymore
    as a consultant, compared to my previous role as a software engineer. I still
    submit pull requests, but usually they are documentation fixes. I also don't want
    to step over the competencies of my colleagues in the platform team who are actually
    building this. So there’s not so much hands-on coding.
  sec: 1068
  time: '17:48'
  who: Chris
- header: Chris’s sabbatical
- line: Okay. And now you're on a sabbatical. [Chris agrees] Can you tell us more?
    What do you do on your sabbatical?
  sec: 1106
  time: '18:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'This is a three-month sabbatical: January, February, March. I have to say,
    when I took it, my intention was to stay away from technology as much as possible
    because I''ve been working at Zalando for five and a half years, and as a software
    engineer, much longer than that. I thought I needed to break. The thing is most
    of my planned activities were non-technical, like focusing on my hobbies. But,
    especially last year and the current period is so exciting, in my opinion, in
    technology – especially in our field, in machine learning.'
  sec: 1112
  time: '18:32'
  who: Chris
- line: I have to say that I still catch myself and try to play with some things.
    Especially last year, three of the most exciting things for me were diffusion
    models. I am not a data scientist – this is not my background. I don't claim to
    understand the papers, even though I looked into them, and I even gave an internal
    presentation in the team about how they work. But I only have a high-level understanding
    of that. But especially as a front end engineer and someone interested in graphics,
    I find it extremely exciting.
  sec: 1112
  time: '18:32'
  who: Chris
- line: Towards the end of the year, there was the release of ChatGPT, which is also
    extremely exciting. Even as a user, as a software engineer, or as someone who
    works in tech, I think this has a huge potential to change our jobs. We can also
    talk about that. So I definitely looked into that. Then there is something that
    is also partially related to what we do in the machine learning space and that
    is running code in the cloud. I was not paid to say this, but there is a small
    startup that I'm very excited to mention, which is called Modal Labs.
  sec: 1112
  time: '18:32'
  who: Chris
- line: It's something founded by Erik Bernhardsson, who worked on the initial Spotify
    recommendation algorithm. He is also the original author of Luigi. Modal Labs
    is his latest project. You can think about it as a very easy way to run your local
    code in the cloud without worrying about infrastructure or about provisioning
    hardware. The idea is that you write your Python script, you execute one command
    to run it, and then it runs in the cloud. It's a bit like AWS Lambda, but much
    easier to use. They also made it very performant. So this is something that I
    started to play with this week and hope to dive a bit deeper during my sabbatical.
    That’s how I’m handling the non-technical. [chuckles]
  sec: 1112
  time: '18:32'
  who: Chris
- line: '[chuckles] So do you still have time for non-technical plans or that takes
    most of your time? [cross-talk]'
  sec: 1276
  time: '21:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have to say that I'm struggling. I’m trying to improve that. Three months
    sounds like a lot, but with my to-do list, it's really hard to fit everything
    in. It's a bit difficult.
  sec: 1281
  time: '21:21'
  who: Chris
- line: Yeah, I also took two months off and I didn't notice how quickly these two
    months passed. It was just – I blinked my eyes and it's over. Go back to work.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 1293
  time: '21:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I drew the lines that I don't want to touch things that I do in my daily job
    at Zalando. If at some point I will find myself editing IAM policies, then it
    means that I crossed the line and it’s too deep into what I do.
  sec: 1304
  time: '21:44'
  who: Chris
- header: ChatGPT
- line: You said that you're quite excited about ChatGPT as a developer and you wanted
    to talk more about that. When I saw ChatGPT, I was blown away. It was like, “Wow!
    So cool.” Now I use it for a lot of stuff, mostly around content generation –
    for posts on social media for, podcast summaries – for a lot of stuff in DataTalks.Club.
    I also talked to it sometimes.
  sec: 1321
  time: '22:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, I read a book recently and I wanted to talk about the book with
    somebody, so I talked to the chatbot. It was pretty fun. I tend to use it very
    often. Recently, it was actually down for a day and it was like, “Okay, what do
    I do now?” I wonder – how do you use it? How do you include it in your workflow?
    What excites you about it?
  sec: 1321
  time: '22:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'I''m still on the stage where I’m discovering what it can do. It''s hard
    to find something that it cannot do. It can work like – the way I mention it now,
    or my metaphor for this is – if you know Data from Star Trek: Next Generation,
    or Jane, the assistant that the main character from Ender''s Game had in his ear.
    They’re super-smart artificial intelligences that you can talk about anything
    with, and it will give you pretty good advice. I think we are still just discovering
    what it can do.'
  sec: 1377
  time: '22:57'
  who: Chris
- line: For example, it can do coding pretty well, so if you're stuck with a blank
    screen, it's excellent to just describe what you want and it will give you a decent
    answer. What was very surprising to me is that it can also work as a sparring
    partner for architecture discussions. I, and also some of my colleagues from the
    team, we gave it three advanced questions, for example, about Amazon SageMaker
    and IAM policies, and it gave very good answers. Here, there is a bit of a danger.
    Because on one hand, these are very good answers that sometimes are difficult
    to Google because maybe nobody else asked this very question exactly on StackOverflow,
    but it still requires that you bring some knowledge and experience to validate
    this answer. Sometimes it speaks with confidence, but it's actually wrong. My
    colleagues in the team and I were generally impressed by this, but we still know
    that you cannot trust it 100%. On the other hand, you can also say that if you
    talk to a fellow human, even if it's an experienced software engineer, they also
    make mistakes…
  sec: 1377
  time: '22:57'
  who: Chris
- line: And they can also be overly confident, right?
  sec: 1491
  time: '24:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely, they can be overly confident in fact. [chuckles] In fact, sometimes
    even more than ChatGPT. For example, one of the questions I asked was also answered
    on StackOverflow and it was a pretty highly voted reply, but I don't think it
    was a very good answer. The answer I got from ChatGPT was more humble, balanced,
    and rich in scope. So that's one of the things I use it for. But like you, I also
    tested this with just general content creation – things that are not technical.

    but also for example, in Polish or Russian. It can be a therapist. You can also
    talk to it about books. For example, it can give you a summary of pretty much
    any book that was written in the last decades, especially the classics, but also
    relatively newer books.
  sec: 1493
  time: '24:53'
  who: Chris
- line: Interesting. Actually, I asked it to give a summary of a book and it said,
    “No, I don't want to do this.” It just said “I'm not good at doing summaries.
    But I can talk about the topic of this book.” I was like, “Let's talk about that.”
  sec: 1553

  who: Chris
- line: Maybe it depends on how popular the book is?
  sec: 1601
  time: '26:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The book I tested this specifically was The Intelligent Investor, it's
    a book about stock market investing. It's pretty old. It's from, I believe, 1949.
    It's been around for a while, so maybe ChatGPT was more confident when talking
    about this book.
  sec: 1577

    right? You discuss books and so on, right?
  sec: 1593
  time: '26:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I have to say that I still didn't fully incorporate this into my daily
    life. I think there will be more and more of that. Right now, I think the UX,
    especially for specific tasks, is not perfect. For example, if you want to write
    code, GitHub Pilot has slightly better UX, because it's just integrated with your
    ID. It's a bit more cumbersome to use ChatGPT. But I would say I'm still in the
    phase of discovery. For example, (we can add this to show notes) there is one
    person I highly recommend to follow on Twitter.
  sec: 1606

    was hired as a “prompt engineer,” which is a person whose main job is to write
    prompts to talk to AI. He's sharing a lot of his findings on Twitter and he's
    demonstrating, for example, how to trick these large language models into something
    absurd. But he also demonstrates what the possibilities are, and I think we're
    still in the phase where we're just learning what it can do. I think we'll discover
    much more this year.

    No, I'm not telling you that.” [Chris agrees] Otherwise, it will be too expensive
    maybe.

- header: How being a generalist helped Chris in his career
- line: Going back to your background, you have quite a diverse background. You tried
    many, many things. Do you think it helped you with your career, for generating
    new ideas, for seeing new solutions? And how did it help you?
  sec: 1740
  time: '29:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think, generally, yes. Like everything in life, there are pros and cons.
    The pro is that it allowed me to transfer different skills from my past jobs into
    new ones. I think sometimes it's just easier to start a new role, where I can
    just borrow from my past experience. I like to think about technologies that are
    good investments over the long term that I can transfer across different jobs.
    I mentioned a couple of them, for example, SQL is one of them. Another one is
    Git. Basically, these are things that follow the rule of “The longer something
    has been around, the more likely it is to stay for a long time.” I think there
    is a name for that. It's called the Lindy Effect. It's named after a restaurant
    from New York that existed for some time, called Lindy’s. And just the fact that
    it existed a long time means that it's more likely to stay around.
  sec: 1756
  time: '29:16'
  who: Chris
- line: I tried to look at the things that existed for a while and it gives me more
    confidence that they will just keep working. JavaScript is another example. Now,
    JavaScript is almost 30 years old. This was definitely one of the good investments.
    Another thing that I'm actually learning or improving on right now in my spare
    time is getting better at Shell scripting and just using command line tools from
    a terminal. This is something that in every job that I work, the more I know about
    this, the more it pays off. So I'm trying to invest into things that I can transfer.
  sec: 1756
  time: '29:16'
  who: Chris
- line: This definitely helped for being a generalist. I also think there are some
    general principles, for example – when I join a new project, I first try to understand
    what the user value is and how it helps the company to build something. So I try
    to have a product and user-centered view on the thing that we're building, instead
    of only focusing on technology. I think this generalist approach helps here. These
    are the pros. When it comes to the negative sides of being a journalist, I have
    to say that, despite spending many years as a software engineer, I constantly
    suffer from impostor syndrome. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1756

    syndrome? [laughs]
  sec: 1905
  time: '31:45'

    it, because they also have major gaps in other areas.

  sec: 1927
  time: '32:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: This week, I talked with two friends of mine. We used to work together on
    more than one project. One of them has been a software engineer for longer than
    I have and he says that he still suffers from impostor syndrome. I think that's
    just something that we have to embrace as part of our job that – regardless of
    how fast you're learning, technology is moving faster.
  sec: 1929
  time: '32:09'
  who: Chris
- line: The gap between what I know as a software engineer or as a data engineer,
    versus what is there, it’s only going to grow, unfortunately. But one very practical
    consequence of that is that experts, or specialists, are able to build things
    faster. If you have a good match between a product that you need to build and
    expertise, then this person is definitely going to do it faster than someone who
    is like me, a generalist.
  sec: 1929
  time: '32:09'
  who: Chris
- line: Interesting. In my experience, it's the opposite. For a project, you usually
    need a wide variety of skills. It's typically not just one person that you need.
    If it's an end-to-end project, which needs front end, backend, databases – all
    this stuff. Typically, if you're a specialist, and you know only the back end,
    it's probably more difficult for you to ask things. It depends on how niche the
    project is, right?
  sec: 1982
  time: '33:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. It depends on the scope. That's why I mentioned that if you have
    a good match between what is required for a project versus the skills that the
    team or the person brings to the project. The wider the scope, of course, the
    expert will struggle more when it's getting outside their area of expertise. But
    if you have something that is rapidly narrow in scope, then expertise will definitely
    help. I can give you an example.
  sec: 2014
  time: '33:34'
  who: Chris
- line: Over a year ago, we had our internal API just going slower and slower – it
    was not really scaling well. Some requests were taking more than 10 seconds to
    return. I am not a database expert. I know my way around it, but I'm not an expert.
    But I was tasked with looking into that and improving that. I think I spent a
    couple of weeks on that. In the end, we got 10 times speed up in performance by
    optimizing our RAM layer for Postgres. But I'm pretty sure that a person who is
    very fluent in Postgres would probably do it in one day.
  sec: 2014
  time: '33:34'
  who: Chris
- line: But with your background and your experience, you knew where to look for the
    answers. It just took you a bit more time to find these answers. At the end, you
    still did it, right?
  sec: 2088
  time: '34:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I'm also quite sure that a Postgres expert would find even more than
    I did. [Alexey agrees] Unfortunately the team, we didn't have someone who was
    a Postgres expert.

    things faster. Anything else?
  sec: 2114
  time: '35:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was also thinking about how it affects recruiting and finding a job. Very
    often I saw that companies look for experts. Sometimes it could be a bit scary,
    like you see a job ad and you see, “We want five years of experience with large
    language models and you have to be an expert in this and that subject.” It's just
    impossible to meet all of that. But there is this common advice that you should
    often apply for jobs, even if you don't meet every criteria. I think this is good
    advice, because in every role and in every company where I was hired, I had to
    demonstrate some expertise, but in the end I was doing almost entirely different
    things. For example, I was hired at Zalando after a JavaScript interview, and
    then I actually learned Python on the job at Zalando.
  sec: 2123
  time: '35:23'
  who: Chris
- line: I didn't have any expertise or any experience with data governance or machine
    learning, but this is what I do right now. It helps to have some expertise to
    get your foot in the door, but then you should be ready to learn. I think many
    people who are listening to us now have heard about the “T-shaped developer” or
    “T-shaped person” and for those who haven't, it means that like in the uppercase
    letter T, you have this one stem that goes deep. It's good to have one area of
    expertise, where you're really, really good at – an expert. But there is also
    this horizontal bar on the letter T. These are other skills that you should learn
    and be able to jump and go deeper into them, if needed.
  sec: 2123
  time: '35:23'
  who: Chris

  sec: 2228
  time: '37:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: The one that is closest to my heart is the web, front end, and everything
    related to HTTP and understanding how things work in the browser. I also tried
    to expand it. By now, it's maybe not a letter T, because I have a few of these
    stems.
  sec: 2234
  time: '37:14'
  who: Chris
- line: Like maybe an E upside down?
  sec: 2252
  time: '37:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m not sure which letter it would be, Maybe an M. For example, I got pretty
    good at using Git. Very often, I help my colleagues to resolve problems with history,
    with rebasing, and things like that. I really also like Shell scripting and learning
    about different Unix tools. There's like an infinite number of them. The more
    you learn, the more productive you become. Then there are some things that are
    maybe less specific to one particular technology, like the ability to debug things.
    For example, the divide and conquer method for just narrowing down where the problem
    is.
  sec: 2257
  time: '37:37'
  who: Chris
- line: Sometimes I'm used by my colleagues as a rubber duck – for rubber duck debugging.
    For those who haven't heard this term, sometimes it's very helpful to just explain
    the problem you have to someone or something, it could even be a rubber duck that
    you have on your desk. Explain the problem and after you explain it to someone,
    the solution just comes to your mind. So very often, I'm a buddy, or a rubber
    duck for my colleagues to help them debug problems. A lot of engineers prefer
    to build new things instead of debugging and finding bugs. I'm actually one of
    the few people who really like debugging.
  sec: 2257
  time: '37:37'
  who: Chris

    really enjoy it, to be honest.

  who: Chris

- line: It’s like you're a detective and you're looking for a solution to a crime,
    right? [Chris agrees] That's pretty interesting. One thing I wanted to ask you
    is – what advice would you give to people who want to do something like you do,
    like change directions often? I think maybe I'll try to answer based on what you
    discussed so far and then perhaps you will add something. From what I understood
    from you, you said that it's a good idea to invest into fundamental skills – skills
    that are transferable, like SQL, Git, shell scripting, terminal, JavaScript, the
    ability to debug things – divide and conquer, as you said.
  sec: 2356
  time: '39:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Another thing you mentioned was product and user orientation, meaning thinking,
    “How does the thing I'm working on contribute to the goals of the company, to
    user value?” I think these are the two things you mentioned, which you can invest
    in and help you when you switch careers. Anything else that you think is helpful?
  sec: 2356
  time: '39:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: I try to avoid giving general advice, because what I learned is – different
    people have different career paths. Before this interview, I listened to a number
    of other interviews from DataTalks.Club. I noticed one thing that people arrive,
    especially machine learning, from very different directions. It's a very new industry,
    and we have different experiences. But maybe there was one general advice I would
    give. Especially when you are trying to build this T shape and get one stem where
    you go deeper, try to find something that you are genuinely passionate about as
    an individual. This will give you a great advantage if you find at least one area
    that you're just genuinely interested in.
  sec: 2443
  time: '40:43'
  who: Chris
- line: I found out that people who just enjoy the process of learning something,
    going deeper in that one area, will always be ahead of people who are just focused
    on results. If you just want to get a job or finish a project, and you hate the
    way of getting there, you will be at a long term disadvantage compared to a person
    who just enjoys, let's say, the process of writing IAM policies. I remember I
    listened to an interview when the person you talked to said that he relaxes by
    writing these policies. So I'm pretty sure he will be way better at doing that
    than someone who doesn't like it. If you, as a junior, find one thing that is
    really exciting to do, try to go really deep into that – develop expertise. And
    for other things that you're less excited about, just do them as and learn them
    as you need them for your project.
  sec: 2443
  time: '40:43'
  who: Chris
- line: It was the interview with Tomasz, which was about his transitioning from Data
    Science to DataOps. That's a very cool interview. Yes, not many people enjoy IAM
    roles. and then debugging them was a nightmare. I don't know how people can enjoy
    that. Luckily, we have people who do enjoy this, so they can help with this stuff.
    I guess, the root cause of many problems, when it comes to cloud and AWS, are
    these improperly configured IAM roles.
  sec: 2546
  time: '42:26'
  who: Alexey

    enjoys this.
  sec: 2579

  sec: 2586
  time: '43:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Like a physical one? [Alexey confirms] That's a good question. I don't have
    one. I also use my colleagues for that purpose. This is another general piece
    of advice. If you get stuck with something, just talk to a teammate and it usually
    helps. Especially now, when we work remotely, I think I would actively recommend
    against it and I would rather say – talk to someone. Now that you mentioned this,
    I realized that ChatGPT could also serve as a rubber duck. For example, I started
    mentoring sessions with a person who is just learning programming. And at the
    very first meeting, I recommended Chat GPT to her and to use it as this assistant
    when she just has a question. We still have sessions between my mentee and myself,
    but in between, she's using ChatGPT and she's very impressed how well it can work
    as a secondary mentor. Maybe this is a better, upgraded rubber duck.
  sec: 2592

    everyone's desk. We still have quite a few of them around the office. Even though
    there is a duck near me, I don't really talk to it. Because I think it would be
    weird. Right? I don't know. I just don't feel like talking to a duck. [chuckles]

- line: One thing you mentioned is that if you enjoy the process of learning, you'll
    probably be more successful because you will also enjoy doing this thing. I wonder
    – what can I do to enjoy the process of learning? Are there tools, tips, tricks
    that can help me there?
  sec: 2692
  time: '44:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a very good question that I also thought about myself. Sometimes it
    just feels like magic – you either have it or you don't. It's difficult to force
    yourself into liking something. I think in the beginning, especially, it helps
    to just let your curiosity drive you. If you see something that is just interesting
    to you, try to go deeper. I think now there are quite a lot of things that are
    out there that could be interesting. For example, for me, such a thing was image
    generation with these diffusion models. In the end, I had to stop because I'm
    not going to become a data scientist, and I'm not going to get a PhD in that area.
    But I got relatively deep, given what I’m supposed to do, just because I was really
    excited about the results and how it works.
  sec: 2715
  time: '45:15'
  who: Chris
- line: Let your curiosity drive in the beginning. That's one piece of advice. Another
    one that I noticed is that sometimes, if you just force yourself for, let's say,
    even half an hour or one hour to look into something – basically, just start.
    Often you discover that “Oh, actually, it is interesting. And I would like to
    learn more about it.” So just starting is good advice. Some practical tip for
    that, which works for me is the Pomodoro Technique. If you just know that, “Okay,
    I will have to work for 25 minutes, then I will have a break. It's not so painful.”
    Then after 25 minutes, you discover that this is really fun and you just keep
    going.
  sec: 2715
  time: '45:15'
  who: Chris
- line: Maybe the last thing that I noticed worked for me – I like to listen to podcasts
    and interviews with inspiring people. For example, when I listened to a few episodes
    of DataTalks.Club – and I just chose them based on the titles of what interests
    me – I felt that afterwards, “Yes! I really want to go deeper into this.” Because
    there's a lot of enthusiasm from people that you had on your podcast. I'm not
    sure if I can recommend another podcast on this one – your competition. [chuckles]
    I'm a huge fan of Lex Fridman’s podcast. He started as an AI engineer at MIT,
    and his podcast was mostly about AI. Now he's someone who’s ventured into very
    different areas and he talks to people who are not necessarily working in technology.
  sec: 2715
  time: '45:15'
  who: Chris
- line: I recommend going back to his earlier episodes, if you're interested in machine
    learning, because he interviewed very famous and accomplished people in the field.
    Just listening to them can broaden your horizons and can inspire you. I would
    say that inspiration is just part of it. In the end, you have to just sit down
    and do something yourself, because you can have all the inspiration, all the podcasts,
    but what matters in the end is that you face some of the pain yourself and try
    to do something yourself.
  sec: 2715
  time: '45:15'
  who: Chris
- line: When you say “just start”. Okay – I have my Pomodoro. I put it on. The clock
    is ticking. What should I do next? For me, sometimes it's like I'm staring at
    a blank screen – “Ah! What do I do now?” [chuckles]
  sec: 2903
  time: '48:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. A while ago, I think it was harder, but for the last few months, you
    can just ask ChatGPT.
  sec: 2917
  time: '48:37'
  who: Chris
- line: Yeah, I knew you would say that. [laughs] I mean, I literally do that too
    now. For example, recently I was working on a proposal for a PyData conference
    that we will have in Berlin soon. And you know what I did at the end? Just talked
    to the ChatGPT. Yeah, that helped. People are probably tired of hearing about
    ChatGPT by now. In general, there's so much buzz on social media.
  sec: 2923
  time: '48:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: There’s also another answer to that without ChatGPT. If you get stuck, I think
    it's a general skill that's very important for software engineers, for people
    working in tech – to break down the bigger problem into smaller ones. If you have
    to build, let's say, a data pipeline classifier – just try to break it down into
    smaller things to the point where you know how to implement it. If you don't,
    just keep breaking it down.

    really cool tutorials on YouTube, if that's your style. Some people prefer reading.
    Reading, I think, is a bit faster and more efficient, but maybe more involved.
    Just try to get anything on the screen – even one line of Python in a notebook
    or your script, and then usually, you know what needs to be done next. Starting
    is always the hardest part.

- line: Right. When we were talking about the cons of being a generalist, you mentioned
    one thing that recruiting might be a problem. I was thinking, why is that? From
    what I see, sometimes, when somebody leaves a company, the hiring manager (the
    manager of that person) wants to hire the exact same person with the exact same
    skills. What they do is come up with a job description that’s just “Okay, what
    was this person doing? Let's just put all that there. That person had five years
    of Spark experience – let's just go with the same thing.” Then at the end, we
    see a job description that looks exactly like what this person was doing. And
    then, of course, it's not possible to hire a clone of that person.
  sec: 3022

    we will help them learn this.” Do you think that's the only reason why we have
    these job descriptions that look like a super expert? Or are there other reasons?
  sec: 3022
  time: '50:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have to say that at Zalando, I'm quite fortunate because people who are
    writing these job descriptions are usually aware of this problem. At Zalando,
    we change quite often, and it's expected that people will learn different things.
    We try to avoid being too narrow. Most of the job descriptions I have seen are
    sufficiently flexible. Where is this coming from? I hope it will disappear. Technology
    is changing so fast that you just shouldn't focus on something that is too narrow.
  sec: 3093
  time: '51:33'
  who: Chris
- line: If you want something super narrow, maybe you don't need a full time employee
    – just a consultant to solve one specific problem. But if you're investing in
    the person for longer periods of time, it's more important that this person is
    flexible, can put something together and build it rather than having just one
    specific narrow set of skills.
  sec: 3093
  time: '51:33'
  who: Chris
- line: Then it doesn't look like a big disadvantage, because there are companies
    who realize this and try to put rather broad job descriptions, like Zalando. [Chris
    agrees] If I'm a generalist and I want to apply to a job position that looks like
    an expert job description, should I just apply and let them decide?
  sec: 3150
  time: '52:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Just try the interview. Of course, it depends. Sometimes it is understandable
    when the company wants an expert. If you’re working on, maybe not using some existing
    model, but you want to build a new machine learning model, maybe a PhD in the
    relevant area is actually someone you want. But then, of course, the cost is that
    it could be harder to hire the right person.
  sec: 3172
  time: '52:52'
  who: Chris
- line: I'm thinking about an example from OLX. When we were looking for a person
    to join our recommender team, we were building a new team from scratch for that.
    We thought, “Okay, if we want to hire somebody senior for that team, that person
    should have experience with recommender systems. Maybe other things are not a
    must, but this thing is a must.” I guess you need this T-shaped profile, where
    the T (the stem) is the recommender experience. So it probably depends on the
    needs of the team. Sometimes you just need a particular set of skills, and they
    are a must.
  sec: 3200
  time: '53:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Well, I think it's getting a bit easier in the area of ML. Even just
    three years ago, it was such a new field that it was harder to find experts. But
    now, let's say you want someone with recommender system experience, it will be
    easier to find such a person than just a few years ago.

  who: Chris
- header: The job market for generalists vs for specialists
- line: In general, do you think companies are looking more for generalists or for
    experts? From what I hear from you, Zalando is broadening the job descriptions.
    And from what I see in terms of what we do at OLX, we also don't usually hire
    for a super niche set of skills. What do you think, in general?
  sec: 3263
  time: '54:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: It really depends. Sometimes the companies have very specific objectives to
    achieve and they need experts. Zalando is also sometimes in need of specific expertise.
    Maybe it's also my personal survival bias that I tend to gravitate towards roles
    where they require a broader set of skills, because that's what I can bring to
    the table. I wouldn't worry about this if I was on the job market.
  sec: 3287
  time: '54:47'
  who: Chris
- line: Just try to develop something that you like. And then develop this horizontal
    bar the letter T to look slightly around your core area of expertise. We're still,
    in general, as a tech industry in a lucky situation where there is still a lot
    of need for people, especially in the field of data and machine learning. So focus
    on something that is interesting to you.
  sec: 3287
  time: '54:47'
  who: Chris
- line: Which today, I guess, sounds easy, but sometimes there are so many things.
    What is interesting for me if everything is interesting?
  sec: 3346
  time: '55:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is something I struggle with as well. You also have to learn. This is
    the opposite from what we were talking about. You also have to say no to a lot
    of things.

- line: Yeah. Like coming back to our discussion about your sabbatical plans, right?
  sec: 3366
  time: '56:06'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 3370

  who: Chris
- line: How do you deal with this? Do you have any suggestions? What works for you?
  sec: 3375
  time: '56:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: What I do is – I'm a huge fan of to-do lists. If you just write down everything
    that is on your mind – just try to capture it. And then you can prioritize. Then
    you can also just drop some things off the list.
  sec: 3382
  time: '56:22'
  who: Chris
- line: To me, sometimes to-do lists feel like procrastination. Like I'm not really
    doing anything – I'm just doing a to-do list, instead of doing the thing. Do you
    get this feeling?
  sec: 3397
  time: '56:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: It could happen. But I think it's even worse when you don't write it down
    and it's just this general mess in your head – when there are a hundred different
    things and you don't know where to start. When it's written down, at least you
    know, “Okay, I can do this.” And the other things will go down in priority.
  sec: 3410
  time: '56:50'
  who: Chris
- line: I'm not sure if it's related, but what I noticed helps me is having some sort
    of deadlines. Also, doing some sort of project work. Instead of, “Let's figure
    out how Stable Diffusion works,” it would be “Let's figure out how I can use it
    for solving a specific problem.” Maybe for Stable Diffusion, it's a bad example.
    But usually, there is a new piece of technology I want to try and I give myself
    a couple of days. Then it kind of helps to stay focused on this specific thing.
  sec: 3429
  time: '57:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think deadlines definitely help. There is this saying that “If you have
    a software engineering task, it will stretch to the time you allocate to it.”
    Sometimes if you allocate less time, it will force you to focus and say no to
    other things.

- line: Do you have any book or other resources that you want to recommend to the
    listeners?
  sec: 3484
  time: '58:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Um, I thought about this. Right now, I noticed that, especially in the last
    10 years or maybe even less, with the advent of deep learning and machine learning,
    it's harder to learn from books because things are moving too fast. In my personal
    experience as a software engineer, some time ago, there were books that were general,
    for example, Clean Code was definitely an influential book. Pragmatic Programmer
    is another classic. Recently, there was a second edition released that is more
    updated. I would recommend this one. These books teach you skills that are transferable
    to other areas. However, they are mostly aimed at software engineers, so not everyone
    from our audience will be super focused on this area.
  sec: 3491
  time: '58:11'
  who: Chris
- line: Right now, I would say I learned more from YouTube and tutorials and just
    finding things as I need them. A colleague of mine, when I was new to Amazon SageMaker
    recommended just going through the documentation. I'm not sure if it's always
    a good idea. I downloaded the PDF. It's 3000 pages long. Here I would recommend
    just looking things up as you need them. I don't want to sound very boring but
    ChatGPT is, again, an amazing resource to poke and get general ideas, especially
    when you get started and you don't know when to write the first line of code.

    So there are some photographic channels that I like. But they’re pretty far from
    what we’re discussing here.

    show notes. If anyone is interested in photography too.
