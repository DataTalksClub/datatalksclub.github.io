description: 'Master data leadership coaching: transition to manager, build stakeholder
  skills, and boost team impact with feedback, visibility, and influence strategies.'
intro: How do you move from a strong individual contributor into a data leader who
  can influence stakeholders, grow team impact, and build inclusive practices? In
  this episode Tereza Iofciu—data science manager, data scientist, data engineer,
  product manager, coach and community organizer—walks through her transition from
  a PhD in computer science to leading teams and running data leadership coaching.
  <br><br> We cover the practical challenges of the manager transition, experiments
  that shaped her coaching approach, and ways to scale manager bandwidth using the
  “pizza” span-of-control metaphor. Tereza breaks down feedback skills, psychological
  safety, and routines for team feedback training, plus leadership learning through
  workshops and frameworks. You’ll hear actionable guidance on increasing impact and
  promotions, making foundational data work visible with product mindsets and KPIs,
  and influencing without authority by framing projects to stakeholders’ priorities.
  The conversation also explores cross-functional and inclusive leadership, self-promotion
  versus bragging, and concrete coaching formats like one-shot sessions, CV reviews,
  and Calendly-driven delivery. <br><br> Listen if you want practical data leadership
  coaching on managing the IC-to-manager shift, stakeholder skills, and boosting your
  team’s measurable impact.

- header: Episode Introduction & Guest Re-introduction (Inclusive Data Leadership
    Coaching)
- line: This week, we'll talk about data leadership coaching – inclusive data leadership
    coaching. We have a special guest today, Tereza. This is not the first time Tereza
    is here. We already interviewed her. Was it like two years ago?
  sec: 86
  time: '1:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think so, yeah.
  sec: 102
  time: '1:42'
  who: Tereza
- line: Yeah, quite some time ago. Back then, we talked about reading job descriptions.
  sec: 103
  time: '1:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Data job descriptions.
  sec: 110
  time: '1:50'
  who: Tereza
- line: It was a very insightful episode, where we talked about how you should read
    job descriptions and what you can do about that. Check it out. If you go to DataTalks.Club,
    there is a podcast section – and if you just look for Tereza… We haven't interviewed
    that many Terezas – only you, I think. So you'll find that.
  sec: 112
  time: '1:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: We can share the link.
  sec: 132
  time: '2:12'
  who: Tereza
- line: Yeah, we will definitely do that. So Tereza coaches about leading with empathy.
    She has helped hundreds of people to level up their data career. This is what
    we'll talk about today. Welcome to the show.
  sec: 134
  time: '2:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you for having me.
  sec: 151
  time: '2:31'
  who: Tereza
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks
    a lot, Johanna, as always, for your help. Let's start.
  sec: 153
  time: '2:33'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Journey: From Computer Science PhD to Data Lead and Coach'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of data leadership coaching, let's start
    with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far? Also,
    maybe you can mention what changed in these two years – between our last interview
    and today?
  sec: 161
  time: '2:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Okay. Yeah, so my career background. I studied computer science, like many
    people, maybe [chuckles] I don''t know. No. [chuckles] I started computer science
    and then I did a PhD in data science – very randomly. It wasn''t called data science
    back then. When I did it, it was called information retrieval and natural language
    processing – long, long ago. Then I worked as a data scientist at XING (the German
    LinkedIn). And then I worked at FREE NOW as almost everything: data scientist,
    data engineer, product owner, senior data scientist, data science lead, senior
    data science…'
  sec: 180
  time: '3:00'
  who: Tereza
- line: Full stack data scientist.
  sec: 222
  time: '3:42'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Transition to Coaching: Stepping back from product responsibility'
- line: Everything. And then, at the end of 2020, I switched to… I basically needed
    a break from being responsible for product and I thought that I prefer teaching
    other people to be responsible for products, so I can take a step back and then
    recharge. So I joined Neuefische, where I first worked as a coach – just teaching
    other people data science, coaching people to switch and change careers from anything
    they had (with or without background in data, with or without background in industry)
    and basically leveling up or stepping into a data career. That was like 2020 –
    so four years. Then I took over… Well, I built up the team. It was kind of a very
    ad hoc team before and then I ended up leading the team and then, at some point,
    I kind of stopped coaching people and just started just taking care of the team
    and growing the team. Then we also merged with Spiced and then the team was huge
    and… Yeah. So that's my background.
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Tereza
- line: And then, last year, I studied… I noticed that there's kind of a little gap
    in industry – more like a mindset that was bothering me. A lot of people think,
    “Oh, I know exactly how to become a senior data person. I just do a lot of courses
    and I become a senior data person and then changing into leadership is just like,
    ‘get the role and then just do it.’” I mean, you also see it in senior engineering
    – in a lot of companies, people are promoting the next lead to be the most obvious
    senior in the team and then that senior is like, “I mean, I've learned stuff successfully
    before, how hard can just doing it and learning on the job be?” That's a lot of
    situations, where you think about all sorts of, let's say, not optimal leadership
    – People thinking that just learning on the job is enough and not taking it seriously.
    I don't think it's people's fault; I think it's the companies’ fault. A lot of
    companies are not really investing in their employees to… [cross-talk]
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Tereza
- header: 'Career Shift: Challenges of moving from Individual Contributor to Lead'
- line: I think I needed something like that when I got promoted from Senior Data
    Scientist to Lead.
  sec: 377
  time: '6:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so… Yeah.
  sec: 381
  time: '6:21'
  who: Tereza
- line: Because it’s like, “Okay, now you have these responsibilities that are completely
    different from what you were doing before and you're expected to do well in them.
    So go figure this out.”
  sec: 384
  time: '6:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Because you’ve done well before, right? I mean, how hard can it be? It's like…
  sec: 395
  time: '6:35'
  who: Tereza
- line: Except now you don't do anything from what you've been doing before. The work
    is totally different.
  sec: 398
  time: '6:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. You were a good developer before and you could evaluate what it means
    to be a good developer, and now you have to work with people, and you're totally,
    like, “How do I even know if I'm good at this?” [chuckles] Nobody's telling us
    even that, you know? “What does it mean to be good at leadership?” Or “How do
    I do it?” So yeah, I think this is more like a general mindset going on and some
    people are thinking, “Okay, I should take this…” That's something I was writing
    at some point that, in my opinion, switching into leadership from any kind of
    engineering or data role is kind of like a career change. I think if we see it
    as a career change, then we are investing in it like, “Okay, I'm a new learner.
    I'm a new person. I’ll get into it.” So then I started offering coaching – more
    like incognito. And then this year, it's less incognito. And, and also providing…
    [cross-talk]
  sec: 405
  time: '6:45'
  who: Tereza
- line: What do you mean by incognito? Like you didn’t officially announce on LinkedIn
    or anywhere? [Tereza agrees] But people are still coming to you for that.
  sec: 463
  time: '7:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Early Coaching Experiments: Free sessions to learn real problems'
- line: Yeah. First, I did last year – I think I offered some free coaching sessions
    in exchange for feedback. [This was] kind of to also understand what kind of problems
    people have. I think I had two targets – there were the, well, data leadership
    people who wanted to become better leaders. Again, this is a point where I'd like
    to specify that, in my opinion, you don't need a leadership title to want to be
    a good leader. I think leadership skills can help you in your career… There comes
    a point in everybody's career, when you switch from “Somebody tells you everything
    that you have to do,” to you figuring out what you have to do. And that's like
    leadership skills.
  sec: 472
  time: '7:52'
  who: Tereza
- line: I have a story about that. I remember when I was in the role of a Data Scientist
    and when I had a problem – when they approached my manager – what he told me was
    like, “Look, you're a lead for a reason. And this reason is you have to figure
    out this stuff on your own. I can help you, I'm always here to support you. But
    like… I need a list of ideas from you. So come up with this list, talk to people,
    see what they need, and then let's talk again in a week.” Something like that.
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Manager Bandwidth Limits: Need for independent problem-solving'
- line: Yeah. I mean, the higher you get in your career, whoever your manager is will
    not really have so much time to have you on their mind 100%. [Alexey agrees] And
    I think at some point, people really high up in their career, like the VP and
    whatever – they don't even have one-on-ones anymore. There's nobody who knows
    100% what you're working on. So in order for someone to really help you 100%,
    they need to be totally aware of your situation.
  sec: 555
  time: '9:15'
  who: Tereza
- line: If you just have a one-on-one once a month for half an hour, and otherwise
    you don't really see your manager that much – that's not enough time to… If you’re
    going like that, just say, “Hey, I have this problem. What should I do?” You will
    just get an… and they go for helping you to give you a solution – that solution
    is most likely to be super nonoptimal. there'll be
  sec: 555
  time: '9:15'
  who: Tereza
- line: Because like I have a totally different context, they're busy with other stuff,
    and they don't have time to really go deep into your problem and then give you
    advice. Right?
  sec: 614
  time: '10:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. And that can happen. I mean, it doesn't have to be that you're high
    up in your career. It just has to be – you can be in a company where they're bootstrapping
    everybody, and then you have a manager that is managing 15 people. Everybody knows
    about the pizza (by the way, Death by Pizza [shows T-shirt]). Everybody knows
    about the pizza – you should only manage a pizza that you can eat, so seven, eight
    slices, and everything more than seven, eight people that you are managing is
    supposed to be too large to do a good job – direct reports, I mean.
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Tereza
- line: Why do you have this “Death by Pizza” T-shirt? Or is it unrelated?
  sec: 662
  time: '11:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Totally unrelated. I''m organizing this conference in Hamburg –
    Python Pizza Hamburg. And then I saw this T-shirt which was at a music festival
    in Hamburg – Reeperbahn Festival. It''s by an artist from Austria. And I thought,
    “Oh, I''m actually running the conference in a couple of weeks.” So I bought the
    T-shirt for the conference. This is usually what I wear at Python Pizza. [chuckles]'
  sec: 668
  time: '11:08'
  who: Tereza
- header: 'Community Format: Python Pizza conference and newcomer talks'
- line: Since you mentioned that, maybe you can briefly talk about Python Pizza? What
    is that?
  sec: 689
  time: '11:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 696
  time: '11:36'
  who: Tereza
- line: Is there pizza?
  sec: 698
  time: '11:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Python Pizza is the best Python conference ever.
  sec: 699
  time: '11:39'
  who: Tereza
- line: Because there's pizza, right?
  sec: 702
  time: '11:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: There is pizza. And there is a big focus on having newcomers give a talk.
    All the talks are 10 minutes long. When you give a 10-minute talk, you actually
    force people to just talk about one idea – one topic, and it's very focused. Also,
    you can listen to a 10-minute talk, even if you don't like it, because you know
    – it's over in 10 minutes. So you don't need… [cross-talk]
  sec: 705
  time: '11:45'
  who: Tereza
- line: You don’t need to sit there and scroll [through your phone].
  sec: 732
  time: '12:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. So I think the conference just happened in February also in Prague.
    I think the Berlin people are going to bring it back this year to Berlin. Some
    Berlin scene [people] might know it. It comes from Napoli actually – of course.
    I mean, it does come from Italy. It’s just imported. Yes.
  sec: 734
  time: '12:14'
  who: Tereza
- header: 'Team Span-of-Control: Pizza metaphor for sustainable management'
- line: Going back to your idea of “You cannot eat too much pizza – six, seven slices
    at most. And the same with the team – you cannot manage more than six, seven people
    at once.” Right?
  sec: 758
  time: '12:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can but… Well, I mean, you can also eat a very large pizza, right? But
    then you kind of get sick.
  sec: 772
  time: '12:52'
  who: Tereza
- line: How do you feel after that? Because every time I eat pizza… I don't feel that
    it's enough for me. Right? And then I eat, eat, eat – until it's super too much.
    [Tereza agrees] Just too much. And then like, “Okay, no. It was too much.”
  sec: 778
  time: '12:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: And that's the point. That's the same. Then the problem is that the next day,
    you will not be able to eat pizza. You're gonna be like, “Oh, I ate enough pizza
    for the whole month now.” [Alexey agrees] That's what happens when you… you can
    manage a lot of people. I mean, that is not impossible, but it's not sustainable.
    It's not sustainable for your own personal health. And it's also not gonna be
    really good… Just like with pizza, right? I mean, the first three slices are amazing
    and then the next slices start to be like, “Okay, I've already eaten.” That's
    why it's nice to go with friends to eat pizza so you can swap slices from their
    pizza – just because it gets boring, eating the same pizza. [chuckles] I don't
    know. It starts feeling like you cannot put as much interest and effort and work
    into a slice (or a person) to do a good job for that person, I think.
  sec: 794
  time: '13:14'
  who: Tereza
- header: 'Leadership Learning: Courses, awareness, and building feedback culture'
- line: So do you think we can learn these skills? If I'm a senior data scientist
    and, all of a sudden, I find myself in this situation where I need to figure out
    what to do without being told and I'm expected to actually not be told but figure
    things out [on my own]. What's the most effective way of learning this? You mentioned
    that, “Okay, I'm an engineer. I can figure this out as I go.” Which is what most
    people probably do. But this is not always the best… the most optimal strategy.
    But is this the only strategy or can we do it better?
  sec: 854
  time: '14:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, the first step is to acknowledge that this is a completely new thing
    that you have to learn. Maybe the same mechanisms that you were using before to
    learn software development (or data and whatever) are not going to match 100%.
    So I think there's [the first] part – you need to find some courses that are really
    [specifically] for this – just as you read the book, did some tutorials, and so
    on, for other stuff at some point in your career. This is the same – be part of
    some conversations. Because it's important to start having awareness.  At first,
    you're not really aware of the new scope of problems that exist. It's just like…
    You don't even know they exist because you've never had them before.
  sec: 896
  time: '14:56'
  who: Tereza
- line: So it's not about always having the solution for everything or knowing how
    to deal with it, but it's also opening up to this awareness that, “Okay, this
    is a different kind [of problem]. This is a problem that can happen. It has happened
    to other people. And then when I notice it, I know how to identify that the problem
    is coming and what to do about it.” And I think the second thing is to work together
    with the team, and be transparent with the team that, “Hey, look. I'm in a new
    role. It's completely new. And I will need your help in order for us to succeed.
    In order to get your help, I don't want to make a mistake over and over again
    and nobody feels safe to tell me about it. Then I ended up having all bridges
    burned, and so on. So let's set up and build up a feedback culture in the team.”
  sec: 896
  time: '14:56'
  who: Tereza
- line: I think that is the first skill to learn in leadership, in my opinion – to
    accept feedback… Without saying, “I think you're lying. I didn't do that.” [chuckles]
  sec: 896
  time: '14:56'
  who: Tereza
- line: Sorry, I interrupted you. Did you finish your thought?
  sec: 1016
  time: '16:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think so. Yeah.
  sec: 1019
  time: '16:59'
  who: Tereza
- header: 'Leadership Training vs. Self-Study: Practical workshops and frameworks'
- line: You mentioned courses and then I remembered that for me, I also recognize
    that I'm an engineer and this is a totally different thing. Now, instead of doing
    things myself – I don't have time to do this anymore. And I still think I am trying
    to… I'm saying, “Okay, I will take this task because this task is interesting.
    This is complex. This is exactly what I like doing.” But because I have so many
    other things, these tasks never end up getting finished. Then I have to ask other
    people to take it over. And then, I realized that there is a problem, and then
    I found courses.

- line: For me, the courses I took were quite difficult in the way the information
    is presented there. Because as an engineer, I'm more used to this problem-solution
    approach. I have a problem, I go to Google (I just look for the solution) and
    then I apply the solution. And this is how my mind works most of the time. There's
    a problem, there’s a solution. But in the courses, they start talking about psychology,
    they start talking about all these things that I have no idea what they are. All
    of a sudden, this became important for me.

    I was unlucky with the courses? Or what do you think?

    FREE NOW basically hired a trainer that would train all the people that were new
    to leadership or stepping into leadership via a two-day workshop. I think this
    training… So you see, it's not a course – it's training. First, it's more going
    towards something that is more like training. But this training was also more
    like, “These are situations and these are frameworks to deal with those situations.
    How do you notice the situation exists? Then there’s a framework  and then exercises
    to apply it.” So now, when you… [cross-talk]

    this is what you mentioned, right? Somebody is maybe not doing a good job, but
    you don''t want to be super upfront and say something like, “Your work sucks.”
    Because this can hurt other people. You''re trying to be direct – you''re trying
    to convey as much information in as little time as possible, because this is what
    engineers like doing. But if you just say, “This sucks,” that can hurt other people’s
    feelings, right? So you need to train… You need to learn how to give feedback
    correctly.'

- header: 'Team Feedback Training: Psychological safety and practiced routines'
- line: Yeah. I always like to do the feedback training as a team training – so not
    just the Lead learns how to give feedback, but the whole team learns. This feedback
    training can be done once a year – you always get new people in the team and it's
    just something that takes practice. It’s just to bring people awareness that,
    psychologically speaking, however people give you feedback, it's going to feel
    uncomfortable. [chuckles] There is not much around that. The only thing that you
    can learn is how to react to something that is uncomfortable. That is to say,
    “Okay, I will be uncomfortable – I'm getting feedback now. It will be uncomfortable.”
  sec: 1218
  time: '20:18'
  who: Tereza
- line: It might be hard to hear, but on the other side, you also want to build relationships
    with your employees. That's why you want to invest in these relationships to a
    point where there's trust, and then you can tell somebody, “The work that you
    did was not good. This does not mean that you are a bad developer. It's just this
    particular work that you did.” I think this is something that a lot of people
    are struggling with – to get their self-worth from another place other than their
    work that they did. And then you cannot criticize the work without the person
    getting upset. That's something that is just something that takes a little bit
    of work.
  sec: 1218
  time: '20:18'
  who: Tereza
- line: I think this applies to every aspect of life. I remember I was reading a book
    about how to give… Not feedback, but how to tell your kids about certain things.
    One of the ideas there was – you never criticize the kid, but you criticize the
    actions. Like, “Look what you did. These are the consequences. It's not because
    you're a bad kid, it is because this is what you did.”
  sec: 1318
  time: '21:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, otherwise, your kid learns that they're always bad. And then
    whatever they do, they anyway can’t make it better. Yes, but this is not how we
    are used to… At least, I don't know, maybe older people. We grew up with a little
    bit of a different kind of – our parents, I don't think they got feedback training
    in the workplace and the books were different back then. So yes, I don't think…
    Unless you get intentional about learning how to give feedback, it won't really
    come naturally.

    with becoming impactful at work in order to get either promoted or to “feel impactful,”
    so to say. So I think maybe in data, this is a little bit trickier than in engineering
    itself. There still seem to be, I think, a little bit of unrealistic expectations
    of data teams. It's like – yeah, it's gonna deliver value, and it's gonna be awesome,
    but everybody forgets that you need to invest in a lot of foundation work because
    the data has to be reliable and daily and in real time, or not in real time, and
    so on.

- line: Yeah need to… And then it feels like you're not really doing anything. [chuckles]
    It's very hard for to say, “Oh, I've achieved something,” or “The work that we're
    doing is impactful,” because you're not always delivering customer-facing products,
    because you're still building foundations and so on, or the velocity (the speed
    with which you're doing things) is not as fast as some people want. Also, how
    do you have this “training the leadership mindset” for work? Which is… Leadership
    mindset, as I said, is not necessarily that you are a Team Lead, but you are in
    roles that require leadership skills. Again, coming back to data, I’m not sure
    if you saw that there are some posts about it, but a lot of people are starting
    to say that “every data scientist has to have a ‘product mindset’”.
  sec: 1472
  time: '24:32'
  who: Tereza
- line: Like, you can't just implement your little model and not care about who's
    using it and what other teams are going to do with it, and so on. Everybody starts
    to be expected to be [engaged in] stakeholder management, and to be able to collaborate
    with people from different teams, and on their level, on their expectations, and
    so on, and then communicate in a “timely fashion,” and so on. I think this is
    leadership – this goes into leadership skills. Because, in the end, you need to
    invest a lot in communicating, you need to invest a lot into working with other
    people, and you need to invest in influencing other people, when you actually
    don't have authority. Because you won't have authority as a – let's say you're
    a data scientist – you can't tell the front end team what they have to do, you
    have to convince the front end team, let's say. I'm simplifying here. So I think
    this is also stuff that people are coming with, and I am trying to figure out
    ways to get better at this.
  sec: 1472
  time: '24:32'
  who: Tereza
- line: I want to summarize what you said. What you do is help people train their
    leadership mindset, which is about learning different leadership skills, which
    you probably need, even if you're a data scientist (senior data scientist, maybe
    not even a Team Lead yet). These are communication skills, working with other
    people, influencing without authority, and all these sorts of things.
  sec: 1611
  time: '26:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, understanding the value – having a little bit of a strategic mindset
    about your work. Start to think about, “Okay, how does my work connect to the
    company goals?” And I'm not even talking about KPIs because KPIs are sometimes
    going through a lot of… I mean, some companies have very clear and well-defined
    KPIs, but sometimes that's not the case and you're supposed to kind of do guess
    work on what the goal, or the strategy, or the mission and the vision of the company
    is. If you want to be impactful, and successful – you want to align the work that
    you do (the projects that you're working on) towards that.

    basically, I'm posting on LinkedIn, and I have a Calendly link that people can
    book. I'm also offering – I've also offered… These are sometimes coaching for
    longer periods of time – people have more complex problems, but I'm also offering
    “one-shot” coaching (or One Shot learnings). So I'm also offering one shot coaching
    for whoever wants to just have a session and this time can be something like,
    “Hey, I have a job interview and I need to prepare for it.” Or I've had people
    come with, “I need to switch from one country to another. How do I relocate and
    adapt what I know about my career in this country to this other country, so that
    I can get a job in this other country?” So it can also just be something that
    we are discovering and it's in one hour, where we have a little bit of an in-depth
    conversation on that. Or CV review. That can also just be a one-hour session.

    and then in your profile, there is a link to your Calendly and people find this
    link. You probably say that “I coach” or “I consult,” [Tereza agrees] and then
    people find the link to your Calendly, where they can book a slot with you and
    discuss all these problems. [Tereza agrees] And then what you offer is a “one-off”
    consultation, which is just one hour, or more regular coaching. [Tereza agrees]
    Okay. And how did you actually find out that this is the way you want to do it?
    Why a Calendly link? Why LinkedIn? Why not, I don't know, partner with a website
    that offers coaching? I know there are websites where you can find some sort of
    catalog (a marketplace) of mentors, where you click “Okay, I need a data leadership
    mentor.”

    moment is on Coffee Code Breaks, which is a community for women who are needing
    mentoring. There I offer a session per month for free. But otherwise, yes, I am…
    Why Calendly? I mean, if you have to manage more than two or three calendars,
    I think that''s kind of the only way to make [it work]. For me, if it''s not in

    What are the tools that you need?” And there's different levels of tooling and
    then there’s the low payment entry, like when you don't pay so many things for
    so many things. The “starter pack” of coaching would be Calendly – maybe Zoom
    or another platform or Google Meet still for free, though, it's kind of annoying.

    people? You know, you have training and coaching, and a lot of people, I think,
    come to me because I have a data background. Then, a lot of people expect training
    as well. Because when you do coaching, theoretically, you're never supposed to
    give advice. That's like the extreme of coaching. I would just ask you open questions
    until, by the end of the hour, you come up with an “aha!” moment yourself. I think
    I kind of go a little bit in the middle, because there's also sometimes advice
    like, “There's a book. There's a course. Have you tried this?” That's for the
    people coming from the data background.

    I think most people living in Germany… If you compare a CV from someone living
    in Germany with someone living in the United States, you see the difference. [chuckles]
    There's so much ownership in, “I did it! I achieved that!” in an American CV,
    while in Germany, it’s like, “Yeah, we did this together, and we built it.” It's
    very, let's say, unassuming. We are also really bad and a lot of us feel very
    uncomfortable talking about our achievements, because they're like, “Oh, but that's
    bragging, right?” I mean… Is it? [chuckles] I don't think it's always bragging.

    I did that.”
  sec: 2236

    did that.” And it's not like they're born like that, you know? It's just a matter
    of practice. You look in the mirror 100 times a day, and you tell yourself (okay,
    maybe five times a day) and you tell yourself, “That's what I did.” I think, also,
    we don't really do retrospectives with ourselves that often. I mean, I've seen
    a lot of people on LinkedIn – they did that at the end of the year. In January
    everybody was doing retrospectives and their New Year's resolutions. I decided

    to ask the right questions, but yes – reflecting on everything that you’ve learned
    or achieved in, let's say, the past year, or in a past job… Starting to put things
    in writing on a piece of paper – it can definitely help you get a sense of achievement.
    Sometimes when you feel… Especially if you're in a workplace where, let's say,
    you don't have given goals and so on from your work. You work for 4 years in the
    same job – no change in title and so on. At some point, it gets… Actually, the
    best example is – ask someone to give a talk at a conference and when they reply
    with, “But what am I supposed to talk about? Nothing that I do is really conference-level.”
    If that's your answer, then you should definitely retrospect.
  sec: 2376
  time: '39:36'
  who: Tereza
- line: I did this course on writing online, Ship 30, and the idea there was like,
    “What do you write about? How do you come up with ideas?” There was the concept
    of the “two-year rule”. And the two year rule is to write down everything you've
    learned in the past two years and to understand, to reflect, to acknowledge the
    fact that there are people that are two years behind you. Then, when you want
    to talk or present or say what you have achieved, it's like you’re talking to
    those people. So you always have an audience. That's also at a conference, you
    are likely to have people that would be two years behind or one year behind.
  sec: 2376

    when somebody approaches me and says, “Hey, we want to invite you to talk at a
    data conference.” And then like, “Okay, I've stopped being an individual contributor
    like four years ago and all I did was talk to people as a data science lead. What
    am I supposed to talk about?”

    leadership – you get a huge… This is what I was also saying, your goals are not
    well-defined in your work. Before, you knew exactly what your value was, and now
    you don't. Then it becomes something where you don't talk about it even to yourself.
    You're trying to [say something] like, “Let's not acknowledge the elephant in
    the room – the fact that I have no idea what I'm doing, and I have no idea how
    to talk about whether it has any value to someone. Sure, I lead 15 people. Nobody
    quit while I was there. But doesn't that happen to everybody?” It's like, “No,
    it doesn't.” And “I got good reviews as a manager. Doesn't that happen to everybody?”
    “No, it doesn't.” “The people under me grew in the role. Within two years, five
    people leveled up. Doesn't that happen to everyone?” “No, it doesn't.”

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Communication Overhead: Behind-the-scenes work for models and open source'
- line: For example. But you could also talk about that at PyData because like, “Let's
    put the model in production.” But what happens behind the scenes of putting the
    model in production? You have to convince the whole company that this model should
    be in production. You have to convince your team that they have to deliver it
    – by “convince” I mean, agree and work towards the goal. You're not doing it yourself
    – alone. So all of this stuff, without this kind of work, there would be no model
    to go into production. There used to be these conversations before, everybody
    used to say, “From data science, only like 10% of the models make it to production.”
    Or I don't know – some random percent that was very small.
  sec: 2618
  time: '43:38'
  who: Tereza

    technical piece of code that you're writing in a data team – you have way more
    work in terms of communicating about it. It's the same with open source. I'm part
    of the Python Code of Conduct workgroup and now I noticed, as part of this group,
    how much communication happens behind every issue and pull requests and so on.
    And that's where the art of communication [comes in], and I think it's like… [cross-talk]

- line: The community is super distributed – people are everywhere in the world –
    yet, they need to make a decision. The decision-makers are spread around the globe,
    but you need to reach some sort of consensus – like, “Do you accept the pull request?”
    Or what needs to be done.
  sec: 2710
  time: '45:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's why I think there's also this “volunteer burnout” that people are saying
    [they have] for open source, because it's not just writing code, and you're spending
    so much energy on talking about writing code. So I think the next time you get
    invited to give a talk, you say yes, and then figure out what you're going to
    talk about.

    listening'
- line: I was wondering why there are no questions in Slido, but I noticed that I
    forgot to post the link. But I see that there are some questions already in the
    live chat. We talked about different leadership skills and one of them was leading
    without authority, which is especially relevant for data people – because they
    don't have influence over the engineers who are supposed to implement something
    or maybe over product people.
  sec: 2760
  time: '46:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Often, the case is (at least in the company where I worked) that we all have
    different reporting lines. I have my Head of Data, for the Product Manager, they
    have a Head of Product, for Engineers, they have an Engineering Manager. In such
    a setup, I need to go to the Product Manager and convince them that “Look, we
    need to try to get this on the roadmap, because this is important.” There is no
    way I can go through my manager – it’s super complex because it will never reach
    [production]. So I need to convince that person in front of me that this is a
    good idea. There is a question from Antonis, “Do you have any tips regarding influencing?
    How do you actually do this when you don't have any authority?” Which is especially
    true in the case of data folks.
  sec: 2760
  time: '46:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think one of the cornerstones is learning how to speak different work
    languages. How you talk to other data scientists is going to be different from
    how you talk to product people, and how you talk to engineers in another team
    and how you talk to sales and how you talk to the C-level and so on. And then
    it's also about listening. So practicing talking different languages, and also
    practicing active listening. With active listening, you start hearing what people
    actually have as a problem, or what they care about, what their own goals are,
    and what are their own perspectives. Then you can organize your message to fit
    that. You want to be able to communicate to the other person to the level that
    they will understand what you're saying. A lot of the time, our problems in communications
    are that we think communication is just about delivering a message. But actually,
    communication is about making sure that the other person understood the message
    the way we intended them to understand it. So that's a little bit more work.

- line: How do I get them to do what I need? [chuckles] That sounds horrible. But
    I mean, I have a project and I need to get this on the roadmap – how do I do that?
  sec: 2939
  time: '48:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, you just have to make sure that they will find whatever you need to
    be important.
  sec: 2950
  time: '49:10'
  who: Tereza

  sec: 2957
  time: '49:17'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Stakeholder Framing: Connecting projects to what''s important for others'
- line: Well, you do that by communicating why that is important, how it is important
    for them. You need to find out what is important for them, because otherwise you
    can’t link it to something that is important for them. Why should they care? If
    you don't connect it to why they should care about it… And, of course, you can
    get a lot of people to do whatever you want if you're best friends with them,
    which also requires a lot of investment to get to that level. [chuckles] So network
    – sort of networking,
  sec: 2960
  time: '49:20'
  who: Tereza
- line: I’ll try to summarize what you said. First of all, you need to understand
    what they care about, so then they also…
  sec: 3000
  time: '50:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s the active listening part.
  sec: 3007
  time: '50:07'
  who: Tereza
- line: Active listening and  then also learning the language they use. And you also
    need to be friends. You have to have a relationship.
  sec: 3009
  time: '50:09'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Empathy in Practice: Role perspective-taking for better collaboration'
- line: Yeah. There was another part. This was a problem I noticed with data science
    people – if you were on a direct track – a very linear career path – then you
    most likely weren’t really exposed to how other people in other teams work and
    what other roles there are in a company to make things work. It was not just data
    science, but also software engineers, and so on. I also worked in teams where
    we saw that there is no value behind having a project manager – I mean, we can
    also decide what we have to do – there is no value behind having a product owner.
    While holding this view on the world, you are not going to be able to collaborate
    well with the product owner and a project manager. The best way to work on this
    view is to find ways to expose yourself – to like to put yourself in their shoes.
  sec: 3023
  time: '50:23'
  who: Tereza
- line: To understand, “How do they work? When is it good for them? When is it bad
    for them? When is it a risk or not? How do they evaluate something as good or
    bad? How would things be in an ideal world?” A simple example is this relationship
    when a product owner or a product manager goes to the data scientist and asks,
    “How is the project going?” After like one week. And you're like, “What? I need
    three two, three weeks to come up with [something]? Why are you bothering me now?”
    And you're like, “Yeah, but I need this because your outcome is used by another
    team, so I need to link this and I need to know it.”
  sec: 3023
  time: '50:23'
  who: Tereza
- line: What Antonis wrote is, “So this is also about empathy, then.” Which I think
    is right.
  sec: 3142
  time: '52:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can’t really get away from empathy. There are all sorts of ways to improve
    your empathy. And I think there are courses for that. I think the science behind
    empathy is that people who are working, that have emotional intelligence, are
    more successful in their career. So that's a good reason to get good at it.
  sec: 3148
  time: '52:28'
  who: Tereza
- line: What you mentioned is – the key idea how you can do this – you mentioned,
    “Try putting yourself in the other person's shoes.” If you try to put yourself
    in the position of your product manager, then you can try to understand what kind
    of problems they have to deal withю
  sec: 3178
  time: '52:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, what problems they have and what they find annoying. [chuckles] Because
    maybe you’re just often telling them, “Hey, can you do this? Can you do that?”
    You don't even know how annoying it is for the person and they're polite, and
    then they don't say anything. But if a person is annoyed, then they're not really
    likely to help you out.
  sec: 3197
  time: '53:17'
  who: Tereza
- line: '[chuckles] There is a funny comment, “Tereza’s description of a data scientist
    leader makes me think that this person is similar to a therapist.”'
  sec: 3221
  time: '53:41'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Cross-Functional Leadership: Emotional intelligence and people care'
- line: Oh, yeah. Especially if you're in a cross-functional team setup. [chuckles]
  sec: 3230
  time: '53:50'
  who: Tereza
- line: Okay, so this is an accurate description. [chuckles]
  sec: 3236
  time: '53:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah. When companies are saying, “Okay, we’re going completely
    cross-functional. And now, because every data scientist is in a different team,
    the data science lead does not actually hold any more responsibility for any kind
    of product pillar – just for the people.” That is being a therapist, yeah.'

- header: 'Inclusive Leadership: Defining inclusion, avoiding exclusivity, and cultural
    diversity'
- line: I noticed that we need to finish quite soon. But there is one thing I wanted
    to ask you. The topic of today's interview is “inclusive data leadership coaching”.
    We talked about data leadership, we talked about coaching, but we did not talk
    about “inclusive”. So what does it mean, and how do you do this?
  sec: 3264
  time: '54:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you think about the opposite of “inclusive” being “exclusive” – you don't
    really get too far by being exclusive in the workplace.
  sec: 3291
  time: '54:51'
  who: Tereza
- line: What does it mean to be exclusive?
  sec: 3305
  time: '55:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: You don't want to work with other people, you don't want to collaborate with
    other people, you don't need other people, you don't care about other people,
    you don't care about their needs, you don't care about how they want to be treated.
    That is being exclusive. Being authoritarian in leadership – that is also exclusive.
    “You get your work done because I said so. I don't care if you care about it or
    not.” I don't see anything positive out of being really exclusive at work, and
    then being inclusive comes in. I mean, you have diversity and inclusion. That's
    also inclusion there. But I think it's also about figuring it out. It's not an
    afternoon of reading online about how to do it – it is figuring out how other
    people want to be treated and working with that.
  sec: 3309
  time: '55:09'
  who: Tereza
- line: So I was not actually correct when I said that we did not talk about this
    because we actually did.
  sec: 3370
  time: '56:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we talked about it. Yes.
  sec: 3375
  time: '56:15'
  who: Tereza
- line: Okay. All this empathy, and trying to put yourself in the shoes of the other
    person, and then understanding why they should care about our problem – of what
    they care about in general – these are all aspects of being inclusive, right?
  sec: 3375
  time: '56:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. And then on the other side, you also have, of course, cultural and gender
    and team diversity. There, we all know that in product, and if we work on the
    data science part, we are probably in product or in analytics – it's important
    to have diverse perspectives when you're building something. Otherwise, you might
    not have a big overlap with the people you're building for.
  sec: 3395
  time: '56:35'
  who: Tereza
- line: I think with that we can conclude our interview. I don't see any other questions.
    I don't think we've covered all the questions that we prepared, but kind of anticipated
    that. But we touched on most of the points. So yeah, thanks a lot, Tereza, for
    joining us again. And thanks, everyone, for joining us – being active, asking
    questions. I guess that's it.

    and whatnot, do so.
