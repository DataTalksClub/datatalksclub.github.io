transcript:
- line: "This week, we'll talk about doing postdoctoral research. We have a special\
    \ guest today, Eleni. Eleni is a postdoctoral researcher at the DIMA Group at\
    \ TU Berlin, which is the same university where I got my Master\u2019s like six-seven\
    \ years ago. This is the same group where I started and Eleni is working there\
    \ as a postdoctoral researcher. She's doing research on spatial big data analytics\
    \ and she's interested in stream processing in the IoT environment. She published\
    \ her research in many data management venues like VLDB and others. One of her\
    \ papers received the ACMC SIGMOD best demonstration award. Is that right?"
  sec: 73
  time: '1:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it was a demo paper. This is a special category of paper where you actually
    demonstrate or showcase a technique or a system that you have developed. You go
    to the conference and you actually have a laptop and show how it works live.
  sec: 123
  time: '2:03'
  who: Eleni
- line: We'll talk about that as well. Eleni also holds a PhD in computer science
    from EPFL. Welcome.

  who: Eleni
- header: "Eleni\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go to our main topic of doing research, I wanted to ask you about
    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 159
  time: '2:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. You practically already covered most of it. But let me also say some\
    \ things from my perspective. I'm currently a postdoc at the Technical University\
    \ of Berlin and I have been in Berlin since October 2019. So, that\u2019s roughly\
    \ two years now. Prior to that, I spent six years in Lausanne, Switzerland, where\
    \ I did my PhD in computer science \u2013 more specifically in Data Management\
    \ at EPFL, which is the \xC9cole polytechnique f\xE9d\xE9rale de Lausanne. During\
    \ my PhD, I also spent some time in New York for a few months, where I worked\
    \ at NYU. Before my PhD, I was in my home country of Greece, where I did my undergraduate\
    \ studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University\
    \ of Athens. To sum it up, I went from an undergrad in Athens, to a PhD in Lausanne,\
    \ and then a postdoc in Berlin."

- header: Spatial data analytics
- line: "My main research area so far has been spatial big data analytics. This is\
    \ the broader topic of my PhD and a topic that I'm still working on, even though\
    \ right now I'm not focusing on that entirely. So, what is it? Well, broadly speaking,\
    \ it is essentially the process of analyzing spatial data to find threads, gain\
    \ insights, and answer questions. Then the next question you might have, of course,\
    \ is \u201CWhat is spatial data? What is this data that we are analyzing?\u201D\
    \ Spatial data is any data that contains some geometrical or geographical feature.\
    \ Spatial data can be points in space that can, for example, correspond to GPS\
    \ locations."
  sec: 230
  time: '3:50'
  who: Eleni
- line: "Say we have data that is about something like taxi rides. That\u2019s spatial\
    \ because we have the location and the trajectory of the ride. It can also be\
    \ lines that represent the road, or a river on a map. This can also be polygons\
    \ that represent regional boundaries and things like that. I think you get the\
    \ idea. These are examples that are in two dimensions, but we also have three-dimensional\
    \ spatial data. That can represent something that has volume in space. There is\
    \ also another category of spatial data, and the main representative of that category\
    \ is satellite images. Because with such images, you have a collection of pixels,\
    \ and each pixel corresponds to some geographic location. So this is also an example\
    \ of spatial data."

- header: Responsibilities of a postdoc
- line: What do you usually do at work? What kind of responsibilities do you have
    now as a postdoctoral researcher?
  sec: 348
  time: '5:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I do a few different things, I would say. Although first of all, I participate\
    \ in research activities, which contain many different things, but broadly it\
    \ means working to solve some research problems, or even thinking about new ones.\
    \ It also involves participating in project meetings with other colleagues and\
    \ writing papers when a project is mature enough and there are results that can\
    \ be published. I also mentor students. So far, it\u2019s mainly for Bachelor's\
    \ and Master's theses. But I also have some experience co-mentoring some PhD students.\
    \ Currently, I also teach a Bachelor course. Sometimes I also have to disseminate\
    \ my research by giving talks at conferences or other venues. Finally, another\
    \ thing that I'm doing \u2013 it's not strictly tied to my job description \u2013\
    \ but I'm also contributing to the international community in my field by reviewing\
    \ papers for conferences or journals. If I look at my week, I would say this is\
    \ usually what's on my schedule."
  sec: 356
  time: '5:56'
  who: Eleni
- line: Would you say this is a typical day for somebody working as a postdoc in academia?
  sec: 439
  time: '7:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I would say it\u2019s more like a typical week. I try to avoid multitasking\
    \ as much as possible because I don't find it effective. I try to have some days\
    \ where I can focus entirely on one activity or another, thus I would say this\
    \ is what a typical week looks like. Over the course of a month or a few months,\
    \ the distribution of these tasks can also change. Maybe there are periods where\
    \ some task completely goes away. For example, as you know, there are semester\
    \ breaks where you don't have to do any teaching or I don't always have papers\
    \ to review for conferences. But other activities, like mentoring students, or\
    \ having some regular meetings with them, are usually permanently on the schedule."
  sec: 449
  time: '7:29'
  who: Eleni
- header: Publishing papers
- line: "You said that when you're writing papers, \u201Cif there is some outcome\
    \ to share\u201D. I'm curious, how often does it happen that you do some research\
    \ and you don't have an outcome to share? You don't end up writing the paper?\
    \ Is this something that happens often?"
  sec: 509
  time: '8:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, that is a good question. What can happen is that you don't have research\
    \ results that are good enough to write a really good paper, and so, it can\u2019\
    t be published at one of the top conferences in the field. To have an idea where\
    \ the results are top level \u2013 that\u2019s really hard. What can happen is\
    \ that initially you\u2019re targeting these top level venues, and in the end,\
    \ your results make it hard for you to publish there. But in my experience, if\
    \ you still did some thorough and decent work, even if the results are a bit disappointing\
    \ and not what you were hoping for, there's still a way to publish your work.\
    \ There are always some interesting findings in it, but you just might need to\
    \ go to less competitive things to publish. But for me, if there are some reasonable\
    \ results, and you can do a good job \u2013 which is usually the case \u2013 then\
    \ it still makes sense to publish them somewhere."
  sec: 526
  time: '8:46'
  who: Eleni
- header: Best places for data management papers
- line: The top venues where you publish are usually VLDB, and what else?
  sec: 603
  time: '10:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: SIGMOD as well. These two are the really top ones. Yes.
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Eleni
- line: "So, VLDB is \u201Cvery large databases\u201D right? And SIGMOD is \u201C\
    special interest group\u2026\u201D MOD?"
  sec: 615
  time: '10:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: "\u201CManagement of data.\u201D"
  sec: 632
  time: '10:32'
  who: Eleni
- line: "Right. MOD is management of data. These are the places where researchers\
    \ who work in databases, data management, big data, analytics, and all these things\
    \ \u2013 these are the conferences where these researchers want to publish first.\
    \ Right?"
  sec: 634
  time: '10:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, these are top value places. There is a third one that I would say is\
    \ equally good. This is called ICDE, which is the \u201CInternational Conference\
    \ of Data Engineering\u201D. I think these three."
  sec: 653
  time: '10:53'
  who: Eleni
- header: Differences between postdoc and PhD
- line: Interesting. Is being a postdoc different from being a PhD student? You mentioned
    that you need to do a lot of things like thinking about research problems, writing
    papers, mentoring students, teaching a course, reviewing papers. But PhD students
    also do these things, right?
  sec: 671
  time: '11:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, you're quite right about that. Overall, I feel that the main difference\
    \ in the postdoc position is that you have more responsibility. So it's the amount\
    \ of responsibility that changes and maybe also a little bit on the distribution\
    \ of time on these different tasks. Going back, as a PhD student, my primary job\
    \ was to work on my PhD thesis. It was clear that this was the top priority. I\
    \ was also teaching as an assistant, but that was not more than let's say, 20%\
    \ of my work time. From time to time, I also mentored some Bachelor\u2019s and\
    \ Master\u2019s students during my PhD, but not so many and not so frequently\
    \ \u2013 like not every semester, for example."
  sec: 693
  time: '11:33'
  who: Eleni
- line: "Also, in my PhD research, I was mainly conducting research on my own. I had\
    \ a lot of alone time to work on my thesis. What has changed now, I would say,\
    \ is that I have more mentoring to do \u2013 now I mentor students every semester.\
    \ This mentoring also comes with more responsibility because I mentor not only\
    \ Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s students, but also some PhD students as a\
    \ commenter. It is important to ensure that they will be successful. You don't\
    \ want your students to just waste their time working on something that is not\
    \ promising."
  sec: 693
  time: '11:33'
  who: Eleni
- line: "Teaching also comes now with more responsibility. Before, as I said, I was\
    \ an assistant. I didn't have to think about the tasks that needed to be done\
    \ \u2013 I was just assigned these tasks and needed to carry them out. That was\
    \ it. But now, I am the one that manages the course, so I need to organize everything\
    \ and make sure that the course runs smoothly. This responsibility falls on me.\
    \ Then as I said, in my PhD, I spent quite some time working alone. But now I\
    \ would say I do less research completely on my own and more in collaboration\
    \ with others. In my everyday life, this also means that I spend more time in\
    \ meetings with other people."
  sec: 693
  time: '11:33'
  who: Eleni
- line: "I also mentioned reviewing papers \u2013 I have to say that this is something\
    \ that I didn't do much in my PhD. But that's normal, because you are invited\
    \ to review papers for conferences when you're a little bit more senior in the\
    \ field. Usually you don't get a lot of these invitations as a PhD student."
  sec: 693
  time: '11:33'
  who: Eleni
- line: To summarize, you get a broader scope of work after the PhD. Previously you
    would just sit and do the research yourself, but now you delegate more of the
    work to others. So other people do research and you're helping them with that
    instead of just sitting there by yourself and doing it. Did I summarize it correctly?
  sec: 881
  time: '14:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I would say currently I actually kind of work in two modes. Yeah, there is\
    \ a little bit of a delegating aspect, which you can say that only happens when\
    \ I work with students. If someone is doing their thesis with me or their PhD,\
    \ they are still expected to own their work. It is their thesis. I'm going to\
    \ help them but I'm not supposed to improve the thesis for them. So in that sense,\
    \ I'm providing guidance. But I also \u2013 not on a constant basis, but maybe\
    \ in the past year \u2013 I also do some collaborative research with other researchers\
    \ that are more at the same level of seniority as me, let's say. So in that sense,\
    \ it's more of a collaboration. Nobody's delegating anything to someone else,\
    \ but rather it's more sharing the work."
  sec: 906
  time: '15:06'
  who: Eleni
- header: Helping students become successful
- line: "I understand. Thanks for clarifying. You also mentioned one thing that I\
    \ think is quite important. You said that now you have more responsibility, and\
    \ a part of your job is that you need to help others be more successful. You have\
    \ Bachelor\u2019s students, you have Master's students, you have PhD students\
    \ that you co-commenter or co-advise. How do you actually make sure that they\
    \ are more successful? How do you do this? How do you help them select topics?\
    \ Because a PhD thesis is quite a large piece of work, right? It's a five-year\
    \ commitment. That's a lot of responsibility on you as well, when you come up\
    \ with a topic. So how do you help them be more successful?"
  sec: 966
  time: '16:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, that's a great question. Okay. Maybe I can also talk a bit about the\
    \ Master\u2019s and Bachelor\u2019s students. In this case, I have to say that\
    \ it's easier, of course. Most of my experience is also working with Master\u2019\
    s and Bachelor\u2019s students. In this case, I'm typically the one that proposes\
    \ a list of topics \u2013 I advertise these topics and then the students pick\
    \ the ones they like and then we potentially tailor it together to their interests.\
    \ There, it's a little bit easier. The scope is also smaller, because this is\
    \ research that needs to be completed within, let's say, six months. That also\
    \ limits a little bit what you can do during the time available."
  sec: 1018
  time: '16:58'
  who: Eleni
- line: "In terms of PhD students, so far, I have only acted as a co-supervisor, which\
    \ means that the responsibilities are shared. But overall, how it works at DIMA\
    \ \u2013 at least what I have seen so far during my time at DIMA \u2013 is that\
    \ we generally have a few bigger research themes in the group. Bigger umbrella\
    \ topics that are mostly, I guess, determined by the leader of the group, Professor\
    \ Markl. The students typically need to identify a sub-topic that interests them\
    \ within these bigger research themes. Already the fact that there's this kind\
    \ of this bigger umbrella topic, this provides some guidance."
  sec: 1018
  time: '16:58'
  who: Eleni
- line: From there, they come up with ideas by reading, brainstorming, talking to
    their mentors, but also to other colleagues and fellow students. So the whole
    group can provide some guidance there. For PhD students, I don't dictate the topic.
    They mostly have to come up with it on their own within a bigger research team.
    How I help them is mostly by asking them questions and talking to them to make
    sure that they really understand the problem that they picked, and also make sure
    that this is indeed an open research problem. I expect the student, for example,
    to be able to clearly articulate what the problem is succinctly and in a sentence,
    ideally, why it is interesting and important. Why it is hard and why it hasn't
    been solved before. Usually I challenge the student and the student has to convince
    me that they can answer these questions about their chosen topic. Then we can
    go ahead with that topic.
  sec: 1018
  time: '16:58'
  who: Eleni
- line: Is this some sort of formal process or does the student just come to you and
    you then have a discussion over a cup of tea and you ask them tough questions?
  sec: 1187
  time: '19:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, it is a little bit of a more formal process in the sense that we have
    some regular meetings with some structure. Also, in some cases, it might be that
    I ask the student to actually answer these questions in written form. Sometimes
    writing down things can help you structure your thoughts. As I said, I'm the commenter,
    right? There are also other people that interact with the students and make sure
    that they're working on something good.
  sec: 1198
  time: '19:58'
  who: Eleni
- line: "But from what I understood, it's actually the responsibility of the PhD student\
    \ to come up with a good topic \u2013 you're just helping them to make sure that\
    \ the topic they pick up is good, and they really understand what they want to\
    \ solve. But it's more like coaching."
  sec: 1236
  time: '20:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, this is how it usually works. In all of academia, I have seen it done\
    \ this way. This is also more or less how it was for me when I was writing my\
    \ PhD \u2013 I was not assigned to specific topics that I worked on, or specific\
    \ problems. I was given a broader direction, but then finding the specific research\
    \ problem within that direction was my own responsibility. I have seen in other\
    \ groups in academia, especially for first year students, where it might be that\
    \ the professor actually gives them some more concrete topics, similar to how\
    \ I said that I give topics to Master\u2019s students. This would be to get them\
    \ started with the first research problem that they will work on. But yeah, as\
    \ you said earlier, the PhD is a large piece of work. Usually you're expected\
    \ to publish two or three papers that will all be part of your PhD. So even if\
    \ you are assigned a topic at the beginning, it\u2019s still expected that for\
    \ the next paper you will be more independent in choosing your own topic."
  sec: 1252
  time: '20:52'
  who: Eleni
- line: "I'm curious, how does it work? You have a broader direction and then a student\
    \ comes with more narrow research? Do they just read a lot of papers and then\
    \ see which ideas they like? Then they just run these ideas by you and you say,\
    \ \u201CYeah, these are cool ideas. Let\u2019s dig deeper.\u201D Something like\
    \ that?"
  sec: 1325
  time: '22:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, something like that. It could also be that we provide a few more pointers\
    \ about what is still open in this project topic. Since the topics are broader,\
    \ it also means that there are other people that are working in this broader area.\
    \ Thus we also want to make sure that each student has a separate topic from the\
    \ other students and that they don't overlap too much. We also have some pointers\
    \ about \u201COkay, these are not taken yet or this direction.\u201D"

- header: Research at the DIMA group
- line: By the way, you said there are a few bigger research themes in the group?
    What are these themes at the DIMA group? I know IoT is one of these topics. What
    are the others?
  sec: 1374
  time: '22:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Now there are practically two bigger topics now. Yes, one is IoT, or building\
    \ a general purpose data management system for the IoT. This is a system that\
    \ we call a \u2018nebula stream\u2019. Then there is another topic that we call\
    \ \u2018agora\u2019. This is a unified data infrastructure for building ecosystems.\
    \ In this ecosystem, we want to bring together different data assets that can\
    \ be the data itself, but also algorithms, models, computational resources, so\
    \ that users can combine all these resources and use them to develop their applications."

  time: '23:08'
  who: Eleni
- line: Is the DIMA group still involved with Apache Flink? I remember when I was
    studying there, it was a very big thing and a lot of research was focused on Flink.
    But now, since Flink is a more independent entity is it still the case?
  sec: 1439
  time: '23:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Not really. Basically, in a sense, this \u2018nebula stream\u2019 system\
    \ is kind of the next Flick, you could say. This is representative of how the\
    \ DIMA group works. Before there was Flink and a lot of researchers were working\
    \ on different problems related to that system. Now we have \u2018nebula stream\u2019\
    \ and \u2018agora\u2019 and a lot of the research goes into building these systems."

- header: Identifying important research directions
- line: "Interesting. In general, I'm curious \u2013 How do you know what the important\
    \ topics in research are? There are some topics, or themes, in the group in general\
    \ and you try to stay within these themes. But this is still generally quite broad,\
    \ right? How do you know what is an important topic? What are the trends in these\
    \ topics? How do you stay on top of that?"
  sec: 1495
  time: '24:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Mm-hmm. Well, it's hard to answer this question and something that is kind
    of hard to do, I guess. It also depends a little bit on how much forward we want
    to look into the future. I think, generally, you can tell what the current important
    topics and trends are, mainly by looking at what is being currently published
    in the major conferences in your field. It can help even more if you attend these
    conferences to exchange ideas with your peers. This helps you identify the trendy
    topics in the present time.
  sec: 1528
  time: '25:28'
  who: Eleni
- line: "As I said, I have also been reviewing papers for conferences. In general,\
    \ this means that I have access to papers before they are actually published \u2013\
    \ while they're still works in progress. To some extent, this can help foresee\
    \ trends that might come up in the near future, let's say within 1-3 years, maybe.\
    \ You still get access to some work that's not published and maybe won't be published\
    \ in that cycle. But you see what people are working on, so this helps you form\
    \ an idea."
  sec: 1528
  time: '25:28'
  who: Eleni
- line: "But what is really hard, of course, is to predict the next big trend that\
    \ will come in maybe 10 years or so. Unfortunately, I cannot claim that I\u2019\
    m in a position to do that. But if you can really do this, it is very valuable.\
    \ These trends in research sort of come in waves, and if you are at the beginning\
    \ of such a wave, and you are one of the first people to work on a certain topic,\
    \ before it is broadly popular, when that topic becomes popular later \u2013 if\
    \ your prediction was correct and this becomes an important topic \u2013 you will\
    \ be a pioneer in the field. Your work will really get a lot of attention and\
    \ a lot of people will refer back to it and cite it, which is something that matters."
  sec: 1528
  time: '25:28'
  who: Eleni
- line: "Something else that I can mention here is that, in the database research\
    \ community, there is a tradition that every few years \u2013 I think every five\
    \ years or so \u2013 a group of more senior database researchers gather together\

    \ with a new technique or a new solution, in order to convince the reviewers at\

    also a lot of metrics that can be important. Something like, the ease of adoption
    of a certain technique, or the usability, the programmability, or even things
    like energy consumption. And these metrics, in my experience, are typically a
    bit overlooked. To some extent, I think this happens because they are a little
    bit harder to quantify and put a number on. That's a bit of a general answer,
    but as a result, if your work focuses on improving a metric that's other than
    performance, it is usually a bit undervalued by the community in my opinion. It
    becomes harder for you to publish your work.

    \ about with a guest a few podcasts ago \u2013 with Barbara, who takes part in\
    \ the Women in Data Science community. There, the question that somebody from\
    \ the audience asked her was \u201CHow can we promote computer science to female\
    \ students?\u201D Because this is not very popular among female students \u2013\
    \ and in general, data science, computer science \u2013 I would say these are\
    \ male-dominated areas. What do you think we can do to attract more female students\
    \ to do research in computer science?"

- line: Yeah. This is a topic that I like to talk about and I personally also find
    it very important. There are a lot of discussions on this topic, so I would like
    to try and to give my personal experience and perspective, and share with you
    what attracted me personally to, first, study computer science, and then to pursue
    a career in research. Then I could try to see how this could apply more generally
    for other women as well.

- line: "So to begin with, in my case, my choice was influenced by my father, because\
    \ he's actually a professor of computer science in Greece. In my case, I was a\
    \ little bit lucky, let's say, that I had this influence in my home. But taking\
    \ this to the general case, I think it is important that we organize events for\
    \ younger students in high school, or even primary school \u2013 in particular\
    \ female ones \u2013 but these events could be addressed to involve students,\
    \ where students can see what computer science is, but in a very gender-neutral\
    \ way."
  sec: 3362
  time: '56:02'
  who: Eleni
- line: Yeah, I really want to put emphasis on this gender neutrality, because I think
    it is really crucial that tech students stop making this association in their
    minds that computer science is only meant for geeky guys that sit in their basements
    wearing glasses and dirty T-shirts. Now, I'm over-exaggerating the stereotype
    from the other side, but this is how CS is often depicted in pop culture, right?
    In the movies, yes. Inevitably, this actually influences people. But yeah, I think
    in these young ages, it is really important for students to realize that your
    gender and your fashion choices are completely irrelevant, so just focus on the
    essence.

- line: "Again, going back to my personal experience, through my father, I got attracted\
    \ to the field, but later on, when I was doing my PhD, it was quite helpful for\
    \ me that my PhD advisor was actually a woman. So in that sense, I had a female\
    \ role model. Actually, what helped me even more was the fact that a lot of my\
    \ PhD peers in my group were also female. To me, it was actually more helpful\
    \ because I could more easily relate to other women around my age, who were just\
    \ one or two steps ahead of me, and I could feel that I'm not alone. That helped\
    \ me to realize that if they are successful, then I can also be successful. So\
    \ again, extrapolating to what this means in general, I think it is important\
    \ for universities to employ females at all levels \u2013 as professors, but also\
    \ to make sure that they are also female postdocs and female PhD students."

- line: "Maybe, finally, the hardest part is to actually keep women in research and\
    \ more specifically, in academic research, in the long run. If you look, there\
    \ are all these different studies that show that in the current situation, at\
    \ every stage, women are more likely to drop out than men. So to begin with, we\
    \ don't have so many Master\u2019s students, and they get even fewer at the PhD\
    \ level, even fewer at the postdoc level and professor level. I think for me,\
    \ this is maybe the hardest problem and it happens because it's quite hard to\
    \ combine creating a family with the academic expectations that require you to\
    \ be mobile and change cities or countries until you get the permanent position\
    \ and you also have to work long hours. So this is one of the hardest problems,\
    \ I think, to solve."

    \ support for women. But yeah, my feeling is that it somehow goes beyond that\
    \ \u2013 that somehow universities need to acknowledge and be aware of the additional\
    \ challenges that women may face in their personal lives and make some adjustments\
    \ for that."

- line: "We should start with schools, right? Like you said \u2013 have these events.\
    \ I guess it wouldn\u2019t be helpful if somebody who comes and presents at this\
    \ event is a guy in this t-shirt, like you described. So maybe it will be helpful\
    \ to have a female presenter as well. Right?"

- line: "I can really tell you from my personal experience that this problem is real.\
    \ When I was younger and I was starting with my PhD, I somehow really felt that\
    \ the way I dress and the fact that I wear makeup and all that, that it\u2019\
    s not compatible with me being in computer science. I thought maybe that it was\
    \ a sign that I'm actually not good for that, which is crazy. But going back,\
    \ I can really see that I was, to some extent, having these thoughts and had the\
    \ feeling that I don't fit into the stereotype and it\u2019s probably because\
    \ I'm doing something wrong. Not because the stereotype is wrong, but because\
    \ there's something wrong with me. So, it can have an impact."
