title: Becoming a Data Engineering Manager
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about becoming a data engineering manager. We have a
    special guest today, Rahul. Rahul has over 12 years of experience in data and
    engineering. He has been a manager for the last two, almost three years. Now he
    works as a data engineering manager at Siemens. Welcome, Rahul.
  sec: 79
  time: '1:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks Alexey. It’s a pleasure to be here.
  sec: 99
  time: '1:39'
  who: Rahul
- line: Yeah, thanks for coming and for joining us. Before we go into our main topic
    of becoming a data engineering manager, let's start with your background. Can
    you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 103
  time: '1:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: Rahul’s background
- line: Yeah. So first of all, thanks, everyone, for joining. And thanks, Alexey,
    for inviting me. Yeah, I started my career somewhere in 2010 – 12 years back and
    started as a traditional ETL developer. I was working with databases (relational
    databases) like SQL Server, Oracle, ETL tools like SSIS, SSRS, Micro stack, and
    then I slowly moved into more master data management kind of stuff for enterprise.
    Somewhere in 2015, I started getting into cloud. The volume of data was increasing,
    so I got some skill set to deal with Big Data and that got me into more of a data
    engineering role.
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Rahul
- line: I made the transition from a traditional ETL developer – or a BI developer,
    as you can call it – to more of a data engineering role. Nowadays, I’m dealing
    with a lot of batch data and real-time streaming data, building pipelines, exposing
    data to consumers – to downstream systems. It's been a very interesting journey
    in the last 12 years and currently. In the last two and a half to three years,
    I took up this data engineering manager role where I am managing a team of enthusiastic
    data engineers here in India and building an IoT data platform for one of the
    Siemens businesses.
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Rahul
- line: That's a pretty cool journey. Your journey into what we call today “data engineering”
    started with cloud adoption, right? You saw that many companies started to use
    cloud and this is when you turned to the transition from ETL developer to a data
    engineer. Do you think it's different or just the same thing, but under a different
    name?
  sec: 212
  time: '3:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's absolutely the same. I mean, the basics remain the same, but you have
    to acquire a new skill set when this data paradigm is shifting. A lot of things
    change when the volume and variety of data grows. In the traditional days, we
    were dealing more likely with structured data, which is more relational in nature,
    but these days with evolution of machines, sensors, and social media, we are dealing
    with a lot of unstructured and semi-structured data use cases.
  sec: 236
  time: '3:56'
  who: Rahul
- line: Before you probably used tools like Informatica, Talend, Microsoft Integration
    Service, and now it's Kafka, Spark, and things like this, right?
  sec: 269
  time: '4:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's more custom solutions these days, which fits our needs. We are
    also moving toward more open source frameworks.
  sec: 281
  time: '4:41'
  who: Rahul
- header: What do data engineering managers do and why do we need them?
- line: Okay. Yeah, thanks. So let's talk about data engineering managers. What do
    they do and why do we need them?
  sec: 292
  time: '4:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually the core still remains the same. As a people manager, you have to
    take care of your team. You have to keep looking at how your team is moving, your
    deliverables, et cetera. But another thing that adds up to this role is stakeholder
    management. When you're working as an individual contributor, you just care about
    your piece of work. Here, you have to talk to various stakeholders who are sponsoring
    this data platform and who are also consumers. These days, the number of and variety
    of consumers are also growing. They are the stakeholders for us.
  sec: 301
  time: '5:01'
  who: Rahul
- line: As a data engineering manager, you have to take care of them and their needs.
    Again, your team is also a stakeholder, so you have to make sure their skill sets
    are getting upgraded along with the onset of new tools and technologies that come
    into play and then coaching them – deciding their career path and sometimes other
    things. For example, deciding for some approach within a team, or sometimes conflict
    resolutions. One of the most important tasks for a data engineering manager or
    any engineering manager should be prioritizing the task. You have a lot of things
    coming your way from various stakeholders. How you prioritize that is one of the
    key responsibilities as well.
  sec: 301
  time: '5:01'
  who: Rahul
- line: So you work on an internal data platform and you manage the engineers, right?
    The setup we have at OLX is – we have engineering managers and people who report
    to the engineering managers are backend engineers, frontend engineers, and data
    engineers. We don't have a role called “data engineering manager”.
  sec: 392
  time: '6:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Usually, there's just an engineering manager who manages the engineers. Now
    I'm wondering why we have it this way – maybe because we work in so-called “feature
    teams” which is a team that works on a specific part of a product and everyone
    works on the same thing. While in your case, your team takes care of the data
    platform. So everyone on your team is a data engineer, right?
  sec: 392
  time: '6:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. Correct.
  sec: 444
  time: '7:24'
  who: Rahul
- line: Yeah. I guess it's helpful for data engineers to have a manager who is also
    a data engineer, or at least someone who can relate to the problems they have.
    This way, they can think about the best way to approach their development and
    their coaching. Whereas if we have just a regular engineering manager, they might
    not know about new data tools in detail, and so on. That's where you come into
    the picture – you give suggestions to people and tell them what is good to learn,
    right?
  sec: 447
  time: '7:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think you mentioned a very valid point. This role, when I talk to other
    engineering managers, I realized that as a data engineering manager, you have
    to be in line with some hands-on activities as well. You should know what your
    team is working on at the code level sometimes. That's how I spend my time. I
    wear two hats here.
  sec: 483
  time: '8:03'
  who: Rahul
- line: 50% of the time, I am working as an individual contributor – as a data engineer
    in my team – and the remaining 50%, I'm managing the team. As you mentioned correctly,
    sometimes when you have technical brainstorming or maybe defining roadmaps, then
    your technical skill sets really come into play. A data engineering manager should
    definitely have some hands-on knowledge, and not only just with managing people.
  sec: 483
  time: '8:03'
  who: Rahul
- line: How do you find time to actually do this? How large is your team – how many
    people do you manage?
  sec: 534
  time: '8:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Currently, I manage eight people. Including me, it’s 9 people. [laughs]
  sec: 539
  time: '8:59'
  who: Rahul
- header: Balancing engineering and management
- line: '[laughs] How do you find time? I guess if you just have one-on-ones with
    everyone on the team, half a week is already gone. So how do you manage to find
    time to actually work on hands-on activities?'
  sec: 545
  time: '9:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Actually, it says it has been changing. Initially, when we started,
    the team size was small. I was able to do justice to both of the roles. Now, since
    the team size is growing, sometimes it happens that this ratio [between the roles]
    becomes 60-40. But I am fortunate enough to have a team around me that is self-motivated
    and self-organized. As part of Siemens culture, we promote servant leadership
    – not micromanaging our team, but rather enabling them to do their best. This
    means that when they need to, they can come to me or come to any of my seniors
    – my managers.
  sec: 556
  time: '9:16'
  who: Rahul
- line: Also, when we hire, we look for someone who can own the piece of work with
    minimal support from a manager or senior folks. That way, the team is more self-driven,
    I would say. This is how I can find some time for myself to work as an individual
    contributor. But I know – I agree with your point, once the team size reaches
    a certain threshold, it becomes difficult to perform both roles together.
  sec: 556
  time: '9:16'
  who: Rahul
- line: Basically, if I understood you correctly, you have some quite experienced
    people in your team, who can take care of helping others with technical problems.
    And in general, the team is quite self-organized, meaning that most of the time,
    they don’t need you. Then you can focus on other things. That's pretty nice to
    be able to have such a team that you can be sure of and that can just work independently.
    If you need to work on something, you trust them to find a solution to whatever
    problem they have. That's pretty cool.
  sec: 633
  time: '10:33'
  who: Alexey
- header: Rahul’s transition into data engineering management
- line: How did you become a data engineering manager? How did it happen for you?
  sec: 669
  time: '11:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Interesting question. Earlier, as I mentioned, when the team size was smaller
    – we had 4 data engineers, including me – at that time, we all used to report
    to my manager, who is currently my manager. Since the business started growing
    and the need for the data platform grew, we proved some of the use cases that
    the data platform can solve. We were getting more and more use cases. Naturally,
    the team size increased as a result. At that time, my manager, who is my current
    manager, just called me to a one-on-one discussion and asked if I wanted to take
    up the engineering manager role. My reaction was “Why me? We have other folks.”
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Rahul
- line: Basically, what I realized is – he mentioned a couple of qualities which he
    saw in me. I was frankly not aware of those things. He said I have the ability
    to see the bigger picture – what business problem we are solving, along with some
    business acumen and domain knowledge, and situational understanding “What is needed
    and when?” That kind of quality he saw in me, and that’s why he asked me this.
    He also mentioned, “Once you pick up this role, you have to sacrifice a few things.”
    We are all passionate about writing code and building stuff, and deploying it,
    but if I take up this role, then I have to sacrifice at least 50% of the time
    that goes on these things. So that was my natural evolution – I was hired as a
    senior data engineer, but immediately after six months or so, I took up this engineer
    manager role.
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Rahul
- line: Interesting. So the qualities you mentioned are being able to see the bigger
    picture, knowing what the business problems are, and you also mentioned situational
    understanding “Knowing what is needed and when”. Do you think that for somebody
    who is a senior and who wants to become a manager is it enough to have these qualities?
  sec: 776
  time: '12:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I think these are the essential ingredients, but one thing that I forgot
    to mention is about people skills. That is most important. In one word, I would
    say “empathy”. That is something that is more of a behavioral factor. So whether
    you can empathize with the team or people who report to you – that's one of the
    most important ingredients. Then you add these things that I mentioned as well
    as some technical skills and business knowledge.
  sec: 795
  time: '13:15'
  who: Rahul
- line: What do you think about technical skills? Are they important for this role?
    Or are they less important than empathy, seeing the bigger picture, and knowing
    the business needs and other things?
  sec: 834
  time: '13:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think they're equally important for this role, because this data landscape
    is changing very fast. We are getting more and more new problem use cases every
    day. I have seen in past teams that managers are not able to cope with the recent
    technology and trends, which are needed to uplift their data platform or data
    products.
  sec: 847
  time: '14:07'
  who: Rahul
- line: In data engineering management especially, you have to always uplift yourself
    in terms of technology stack. You may not be going into too much detail of solving
    every individual particular issue, but at least the high-level idea – the limitations
    and features of particular products or offerings – you should be aware of.
  sec: 847
  time: '14:07'
  who: Rahul
- header: The importance of updating your skill set
- line: Okay, so let's say for an example – right now you heard that there is a tool
    called Prefect, which might be nicer and then maybe you allocate some time to
    give it a try. Then you see how it is different from the current technologies
    that you use. Then maybe you also show others, “Hey, this is the tool I played
    with. Let's give it a try.”Or “Let's not give it a try, because it doesn't really
    work for us.” So you’re talking about doing things like this, right? Just trying
    new tools and then sharing them with the team.
  sec: 894
  time: '14:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, absolutely. Along with some senior data engineers and the team, you
    just brainstorm what problems this tool can solve. It has various angles, like
    the cost involved, licensing fees, how easy it to work with, etc. – so all sorts
    of analysis. As a data engineering manager, you should be able to contribute to
    those kinds of discussions. That's why I think having technical know-how is not
    negotiable.
  sec: 925
  time: '15:25'
  who: Rahul
- line: For you, I think it's especially important because you spend 40 to 50% of
    your time on hands-on activities, right? You wouldn't be able to do this if you
    didn't have these technical skills.
  sec: 959
  time: '15:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. That's why consciously, I chose this. I have the flexibility here
    in Siemens to become a full-time people manager without giving much time to the
    technical aspect. But consciously I chose this way – to be in line with technical
    trends.
  sec: 971
  time: '16:11'
  who: Rahul
- header: Planning the transition to manager and other challenges
- line: So you had this chat with your manager and he told you, “Hey, you're doing
    such a good job as a data engineer, how about becoming a manager?” Your first
    reaction was “Why me?” But then I guess it took some time for you to think about
    this and agree. After that, what did you do next? Did you do anything to make
    this transition smooth, or what did you do?
  sec: 992
  time: '16:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not exactly, to be very honest. I didn't jot out any plan, because the team
    was growing at that point in time. Though I did get involved in some hiring, etc,
    but I did not have any plan at that point in time. It was more of a natural evolution.
    But over the last two and a half to three years, I have learned many things that
    I was not doing initially. And I have also learned a few things that I could have
    done better when I took up this role. At this point, I would say it was more organic.
    I learned on the job, you know?
  sec: 1018
  time: '16:58'
  who: Rahul
- line: A lot of the time, I used to do one-on-ones with my manager in order to understand
    how I should be thinking – not as an individual contributor, but as an engineering
    manager. But when I reflect back, I think I could have done better planning, like
    the 30-60-90 days plan or something like that. Then it would have been a much
    smoother journey. But still, it was quite a decent journey for this transition.
  sec: 1018
  time: '16:58'
  who: Rahul
- line: So learning by trial and error, right?
  sec: 1094
  time: '18:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sometimes. A few things I have learned the hard way, which I could have
    avoided. But it's fine.
  sec: 1098
  time: '18:18'
  who: Rahul
- line: What were the main challenges for you in this transition?
  sec: 1105
  time: '18:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: At the beginning, the first challenge was to get accepted in the team. Because
    you are one of the team members who just elevated as a data engineering manager.
    So building trust with the existing team and getting accepted was the biggest
    challenge initially. Then later, I realized I was getting into all the stuff,
    each and every piece of work without prioritizing them. It was really overwhelming.
    That’s another thing I learned – how to prioritize. When you're dealing with multiple
    stakeholders, people are coming from everywhere. There’s too much context switching
    that you are doing. It's difficult to focus on certain things. This was the biggest
    challenge initially.
  sec: 1113
  time: '18:33'
  who: Rahul
- line: Over a period of time I learned, reflected back and learned again. You cannot
    achieve everything on your plate, so you have to prioritize the high priority
    items, critical items, and then go with that. One more challenge, initially –
    I spend a lot of thinking about it – how do you uplift your team? That's one of
    your core responsibilities. Currently, if my team is delivering or staying at
    a particular quality of individuals – next year, am I able to uplift them or not?
    Are they getting better or not? Those were the initial challenges.
  sec: 1113
  time: '18:33'
  who: Rahul
- line: How about delegating? Was it difficult for you to do? You said that you realized
    that it’s impossible to achieve everything. You cannot do everything yourself.
    How did you realize, “Okay. I cannot do this thing. I need to delegate it to somebody
    else.” How was this for you? Was it difficult? How do you learn to do this?
  sec: 1211
  time: '20:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was difficult and it still is difficult at this point as well, to be honest.
    The culture we have here in Siemens – you do not dictate things to people. It's
    more of an open culture. In this case, influencing somebody to take on a few things
    is really tricky, but I'm still learning that and I have learned a lot in recent
    times. This comes from trust – if somebody has trust in you and they can just
    take on a few things which are maybe not interesting in nature and they do not
    like doing it, but just to support you, they will do it. So, I’m still learning,
    but that was a challenge initially.
  sec: 1233
  time: '20:33'
  who: Rahul
- line: You said, if you were to go through this process again, you would do better
    planning – you mentioned this 30-60-90 day thing. Can you maybe tell us a bit
    more about that? What else would you do differently if you needed to go through
    this transition again?
  sec: 1279
  time: '21:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Again, when I reflect back I see that I was initially playing it very
    safe. I was not questioning people if something was not working well and just
    trying to build some trust. At the time, I was not questioning people and not
    being very assertive in the beginning, because I didn't want to counter them with
    certain questions. I thought the relationship would be good if I did it this way
    to start with. But I think there are a few things where I could have been more
    assertive with the team and with some of the stakeholders on some non-negotiable
    items.
  sec: 1301
  time: '21:41'
  who: Rahul
- line: That’s something that I would do if I got the chance to relive those moments
    again. Another thing which I think I should have done in the very beginning is
    setting out clear expectations with the team – defining core goals and objectives
    etc. Also how together as a team we will achieve those goals or how they will
    achieve them as individuals. I started that a little bit late, but I think I should
    have done that much earlier.
  sec: 1301
  time: '21:41'
  who: Rahul
- header: Setting expectations for the team and measuring success
- line: And how do you set clear expectations for a team? Let's say you have a team
    that works on a data platform for IoT. How do you set expectations for them? How
    do you understand what the team's purposes are?
  sec: 1375
  time: '22:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it took quite some time to build the framework to set this because the
    nature of businesses changes very dynamically and you will have the requirements
    that change very often. What I did and we did as an organization and as a team
    is define the goals by placing them into two categories. One category includes
    committed objectives or goals, and the other category is aspirational goals. In
    the committed objectives, we put certain things that should not be missing delivery
    timelines – no spillover into the next sprint, the code quality should be good,
    no defects – all those things that are expected of software engineers or data
    engineers. Those are committed goals that are non-negotiable – ones that you have
    to achieve. We have certain metrics to track those.
  sec: 1395
  time: '23:15'
  who: Rahul
- line: You also have to uplift the team. With a mature team, all committed goals
    are more or less met always, but the challenge comes when you want to uplift the
    game. Goals like “How do you modernize your data platform?” Or “How do you challenge
    the status quo of the processes that you are following?” Those are the goals that
    I put in as part of aspirational targets or aspirational goals. These aspirational
    goals should be big enough that you should not be able to achieve 100%. That's
    why we call them aspirational goals. If you achieve 50-70% of that, then you're
    good to go. That way, we are trying to build a framework for expectation management
    and performance management.
  sec: 1395
  time: '23:15'
  who: Rahul
- line: Thanks. We have a related question from Lok. The question is “What are the
    success measures of a data engineering team?”
  sec: 1504
  time: '25:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: As a team, I would say success is measured by how you enable or cultivate
    the data culture within the organization or among the stakeholders who are interacting
    with you. Before data came into picture, people made decisions based on the judgment
    calls or gut feelings – those should be more data driven in nature. That, I think,
    is not a tangible thing, but rather it's a cultural thing.
  sec: 1513
  time: '25:13'
  who: Rahul
- line: Something tangible is if you are able to serve more and more use cases for
    our data consumers and by removing some of the frictions, meaning how easily we
    can expose our data to various stakeholders in different formats. It could be
    like reporting, visualization, some RESTful API's for applications, some data
    for machine learning or data science community within the organization. The variety
    of use cases you are able to support with the use of a data platform, I think
    that's one of the KPIs of success.
  sec: 1513
  time: '25:13'
  who: Rahul
- line: Interesting. Are there any other formal metrics? We have objectives and then
    you probably look at the objectives to understand if the team is moving in the
    right direction. So apart from that, maybe there is no need to have other formal
    metrics and KPIs. Right?
  sec: 1599
  time: '26:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: We capture some metrics. The data quality metrics is something we capture.
    We also have the data reconciliation framework, which we capture in terms of percentage
    – for different lines of businesses of data. Along with that, some basic percentage
    coverage of our source system data – what we have to offer – and how we are enriching
    the data. This means how we uplifted the quality of the data using some smart
    ways, including third party data and things like that. It's very difficult to
    measure the success of a data platform because it sits at the back end. There
    are certain limits to what you can put as the metrics. But I think one of the
    key metrics is how many consumers you're serving and if they're interested in
    your data.
  sec: 1623
  time: '27:03'
  who: Rahul
- header: Data reconciliation
- line: Yeah, that's a good one. What is data reconciliation?
  sec: 1684
  time: '28:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Basically, you're pulling data from various source systems and loading it
    into your data warehouse or data lake. In between that, there is an ETL layer
    involved. What we do once our data load is done in batch mode or real-time mode,
    we reconcile what we had in the source system versus the target to see “Are we
    losing any data in between or not?” That’s the kind of framework we have built.
  sec: 1689
  time: '28:09'
  who: Rahul
- line: Yeah. You’re not supposed to lose any data, right?
  sec: 1714
  time: '28:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely.
  sec: 1719
  time: '28:39'
  who: Rahul
- line: What are some reasons for why we can lose something? Because of downtime,
    right?

    some data – let's say you're not putting proper exception handling sometimes –
    that's how you can also lose data.

- line: There is a question that is related, I think, to the data platform. “Data
    engineering is moving towards full automation with data versioning and managed
    model serving – how do you solve GDPR compliance issues and bring stakeholders
    on board?” That's quite not an easy question, right? What do you do about this
    GDPR in your case for IoT?
  sec: 1741
  time: '29:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. We do not have many GDPR-related compliances issues. Our business
    is B2B – it's not really to an end customer. But still, we cater to certain data
    sets which have to be GDPR-compliant. Basically, the data warehouse tool that
    we have chosen is cloud-based, where we do a lot of dynamic data masking, which
    is a lot different from the static data masking in traditional days. We have role-based
    access control put on top of it, so only certain people can see certain kinds
    of data. We have tagged our data in terms of “highly classified” and “public”
    data sets, and then put dynamic data masking and role-based access control on
    top of it. Therefore authorized people can access the data which they're supposed
    to.
  sec: 1768
  time: '29:28'
  who: Rahul
- line: “Dynamic data masking” is when you see some personal data or some restricted
    data, then it is replaced with something else. Right? So instead of an email address,
    you see a hash or something like that?
  sec: 1832

- header: Data modeling for Big Data
- line: Yeah, nice. Thanks. Another question from Nishikant is, “How do you handle
    data modeling for big data? Do you do Agile or something like this to handle evolving
    requirements?”
  sec: 1850
  time: '30:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Initially, we had quite a lot of challenges with this because we have defined
    a certain data model and the variety of use cases started increasing. Earlier,
    we were following typical ETL methodology, where we extract the data, transform
    it, and load it into a target data model. But that was very tightly coupled. The
    data model was very fixed in nature. That's how we realized that we cannot live
    with that. It's not scalable or flexible.
  sec: 1866
  time: '31:06'
  who: Rahul
- line: We changed our approach from ETL to ELT – basically, pulling the data, loading
    into our data warehouse, and then transforming it on the go. That's how our data
    model became more resilient, more flexible in nature, and with less dependency
    on different data marts or tables. We have also implemented a data lake for our
    data platform, which is more robust in nature compared to a data warehouse.
  sec: 1866
  time: '31:06'
  who: Rahul
- line: So, if something changes, then it means that maybe you will need to go back
    to the previous year and recompute some things if you do a change in schema, right?
    Because you keep the raw data in your data lake, so if you make some changes in
    your data model, then you just go and recompute it.
  sec: 1931
  time: '32:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. We do not change data models very often. Rather, we have a flat data
    model in place. We serve the consumers and perform all these aggregations in real
    time for most of the use cases. However, certain pieces of data, which are a kind
    of “master data” are more structured in nature. There, we have very traditional
    data models. Basically, in order to handle big data we are dealing with the combination
    of a traditional data model, a flat data model, as well as the data lake.
  sec: 1949
  time: '32:29'
  who: Rahul
- line: What if the raw data changes? I guess you will need to somehow think how exactly
    you can read the old raw data and the new raw data, right?
  sec: 1986
  time: '33:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. We are maintaining data lineage in this case. A lot of time, we put
    in cache the old data that is most frequently used in our warehouse. When the
    new data comes, we recalculate that – I mean, invalidate and reactivate the cache
    to serve the data to customers faster.

- line: Okay. Back to our topic of data engineering management – there are still a
    few things I wanted to ask you. What would you suggest to somebody who is transitioning
    right now into an engineering management role and specifically to a data engineering
    management role?
  sec: 2019
  time: '33:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think there are a few things that you have to accept from day one. You cannot
    continue playing the individual contributor role, because you have limited time.
    Some of the mistakes I have seen people make more often are that they still are
    very much fascinated with the coding part of it. But you have to just uplift yourself
    and see the bigger picture from the whole business point of view, “What problem
    are you solving?” The second thing is empathy – if you're genuinely interested
    in the growth of your team members, that shows. It is clearly visible.
  sec: 2042
  time: '34:02'
  who: Rahul
- line: You should have certain career planning strategies for every team member.
    You need to sit down with them, know their aspirations, build some career planning
    strategies, and enable them to achieve those skills or the goals that they’re
    aiming for. Just to summarize, I would say let go of a few technical things and
    don’t go much deeper into all the technical aspects. Then, empathize with the
    team members. You also have to be on top of the game. You have to know what the
    latest trends are, so you can enable your team to think in a certain direction
    or be able to expose these new areas of work to them.
  sec: 2042
  time: '34:02'
  who: Rahul
- header: Staying on top of trends and enabling team members
- line: That was actually the question that I wanted to ask you – how exactly do you
    enable team members? One thing is to be on top of the latest trends. How do you
    actually do this? How do you stay on top of trends? I'm a data scientist and in
    data science, there are so many things happening, it's just simply impossible
    to stay on top of it all. I think data engineering is also an actively developing
    area – new tools appear and new ways of doing stuff appear. How do you manage
    to stay on top of that?
  sec: 2138
  time: '35:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I say “stay on top of it,” I don’t necessarily mean that you always change
    your platforms, tools, and techniques. You need a certain kind of stability. When
    I say “reinventing yourself,” I mean getting better at what you’re doing. For
    example, let's say somebody joined my team as a new data engineer, and it took
    two or three weeks to develop a data pipeline – to test it, and deploy it into
    production. Next time, if the same pipeline comes along or a similar thing comes
    along, it should take a little less than that. That's how you grow.
  sec: 2168
  time: '36:08'
  who: Rahul
- line: The second thing is – we have come a certain way in the last two to three
    years with a majority of data platforms. What are things that we can make more
    modular? What are some things that we can automate? We have to constantly think
    about those lines. We have to make sure that team members are not doing monotonous
    work. That should be the benchmark. When you challenge that sort of monotonousness,
    obviously, you will try to figure out new ways or smart ways of doing the same
    work. That's how your team will always be indirectly challenging the status quo.
  sec: 2168
  time: '36:08'
  who: Rahul
- line: Okay, so it's not about staying up to date with state-of-the-art things and
    knowing all the newest technologies, it's more about knowing what's happening
    in the team and how we can make their lives easier and the work more interesting,
    right?
  sec: 2245
  time: '37:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.  It's sometimes a challenge to put some restrictions on this because
    people are very passionate about “I want to implement this new tool in the market
    or automation. Build versus buy.” All those things. But you have to just sit down,
    calm the team, and just focus on the end goal – what we are trying to achieve.
    Don’t get fascinated with the technology, new tool sets, or SaaS offerings each
    day or continuously.
  sec: 2263
  time: '37:43'
  who: Rahul
- line: Yeah, it's very easy to get caught up in it because you see all these tools
    appear, people on Twitter talk about this and in other social media. It can feel
    like “Okay, this is the tool. I need to stop doing everything and try this.” But
    this tool is not actually solving your business problem.

    team should know? You manage a team as a manager – what qualities should the team
    have?
  sec: 2316
  time: '38:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: First of all, I think they should start with understanding the problem statement
    or the business problem. Sometimes there is no problem, but using the power of
    data you can solve certain use cases. Firstly, the team should be mature or think
    from that direction and then comes the technology part. If I talk about the tech
    stack, I always go to very basics – as a data engineer, you should know SQL, ETL
    concept, data warehousing concept, at least one scripting language like Python
    or Spark, a typical CI/CD framework, and cloud. These are the basics that are
    important – which are non-negotiable in the current situation. Ownership is something
    that I think is the most important piece.
  sec: 2334
  time: '38:54'
  who: Rahul
- line: What is ownership?
  sec: 2402
  time: '40:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Ownership is basically a certain decision you're making. If something goes
    wrong, or maybe something fails – you own that and you do not go into certain
    blame games. You just try to fix it first and then see what happened without getting
    asked from managers or senior people or stakeholders.
  sec: 2405
  time: '40:05'
  who: Rahul
- line: So, if something breaks, you don't wait until your manager comes and says,
    “Hey, why is this pipeline not working?” Is that right?
  sec: 2435
  time: '40:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. Initially, I used to get a lot of alerts when something failed.
    But then I just delegated that work. We decided on the ownership of certain pieces,
    so I do not receive alerts anymore. I trust the team to take care of these things.
  sec: 2445
  time: '40:45'
  who: Rahul
- header: The qualities of a good data engineer candidate (interview advice)
- line: Okay. Technology-wise, you said that the non-negotiable minimum in SQL, knowing
    what ETL is, knowing what a data warehouse is, one scripting language like Python,
    knowing the concept of CI/CD, and knowing a cloud platform. That's the technology
    part. Then there’s also this business acumen part – knowing the problems and things
    like that. These are the qualities that people in the data engineering team –
    the data engineers – should have, right? We also mentioned ownership. As a manager,
    you probably devote a lot of time to hiring people. I guess these are the things
    that you look for in candidates – you want to see these qualities in the candidates,
    right?
  sec: 2460
  time: '41:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. Plus there’s one more thing that I would add. When it comes to
    hiring, especially with this remote work environment, something called communication
    skills becomes very important. How you communicate and how proactive you are.
    One thing I look for and the very first question that I sometimes ask to the candidate
    is, “Explain in five minutes one of your best projects – one that you implemented
    or that you were part of.” I would say that shows how a candidate articulates
    things and if they stay to a very precise answer. That is something that was important
    before this pandemic, but nowadays it has become even more important.
  sec: 2511
  time: '41:51'
  who: Rahul
- line: “Explain your project in five minutes” I guess the “five minutes” part is
    also quite important, right? Because I imagine if somebody asks me about a project
    I'm proud of, then they’ll probably need to stop me at some point, because I can
    just go on and on and on. So here, you have to be concise, right?
  sec: 2564
  time: '42:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: You have to be concise, and just think as if you're explaining these things
    to non-data or non-IT people. In other words – how would you explain this without
    going into too much technical detail? First, start with a business use case and
    what you or your team did to solve it. That's why I keep a limit of five minutes.
    If I have any further questions – if I'm interested to know something more – then
    I dig deeper into it and a set of follow-up questions takes place.
  sec: 2585
  time: '43:05'
  who: Rahul
- line: So when you start talking about the project, you should start with the business
    problem. Do not jump into, “I was using Spark to move one terabyte of data in
    Parquet from S3 to Google cloud storage.” Nobody cares, right? [laughs] Start
    with the business problem.
  sec: 2622
  time: '43:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. That's a common mistake that people make. They start jumping directly
    into the technology part of it. I mean, that's something they are passionate about,
    but you still have to be able to articulate these things in less time.
  sec: 2639
  time: '43:59'
  who: Rahul
- line: Yeah. This is a mistake that I also make quite often because I'm so proud
    of what I built and I want to talk about it. But then I forget about the fact
    that I was not doing it for the sake of doing it, but because there was some problem
    that I was trying to solve. It's important to bring this up. What else do you
    ask in an interview?
  sec: 2663
  time: '44:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Initially, I did part of the technical screening as well, but these days I
    focus more on the hiring manager round. Somebody from my team or the PR team does
    the technical discussions. If that goes through, then the hiring manager round
    comes, where I mostly focus on, as I mentioned, about the project. The second
    thing is just trying to gauge what the candidate can do – not focusing on what
    they have done in the past, but what they can do in the future for the team or
    the organization. It is difficult, but we ask certain incidents and how they would
    react to them.
  sec: 2688
  time: '44:48'
  who: Rahul
- line: Sometimes I put them into certain hypothetical situations and see how they
    would respond to that. For example, “If you want to launch Amazon.com in Antarctica,”
    or “Launching Uber in China.” That gives me the thought process of the person
    that is not related directly to data engineering concepts, but how a person thinks
    about a problem. The answer may not be 100% right, obviously, but I just try to
    gauge the approach. Along with that, there are certain leadership qualities, like
    customer obsession. I ask them to tell me some cases that showcase their customer
    obsession and their ownership, as I mentioned. So, a discussion along these lines.
  sec: 2688
  time: '44:48'
  who: Rahul
- line: So, what's the right answer to “How do you open Amazon.com in Antarctica?”
    [laughs]
  sec: 2790
  time: '46:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] I don''t know the right answer. If Amazon hires me and asks me to
    do it, I may not be the right person for it. But I think this starts with… There
    could be many right answers to it.'
  sec: 2796
  time: '46:36'
  who: Rahul
- line: Maybe the right answer is that you don't open it there?
  sec: 2814
  time: '46:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no. That's a prerequisite that you have to do it. [laughs] You cannot
    bypass that.
  sec: 2823
  time: '47:03'
  who: Rahul
- line: Okay. Can you tell us about your best hire?
  sec: 2833
  time: '47:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think there were a couple of them in recent times. They have shown
    similar qualities when they went through the interview. As I mentioned, these
    are the technical skill set plus the hiring manager behavioral skills, which I
    try to judge people on. When you talk about the “best hire” something has to be
    different than the other hires, right? I recall one hire about six months back,
    and another one maybe eight months back. Both of those guys adhered to all these
    qualities that we were trying to judge them on. But on top of that, they were
    very keen on understanding our use cases, what we are trying to achieve, and the
    job fitment, basically. This means “What do we expect from them in the short term
    and the mid-term as an engineering manager.” So they were trying to gauge that.
  sec: 2838
  time: '47:18'
  who: Rahul
- line: They weren’t just applying for a random job and just appearing for an interview,
    but they did a lot of due diligence about the company and about the team. They
    reached out to other team members over LinkedIn, saw their profiles, where they
    come from – all this due diligence they did. Once the interview round was finished,
    we were about to go to the HR discussion. But, each of them separately, asked
    to have one more discussion with me, where they kind of interviewed me about their
    career path, what's the next role they should aspire for in the organization.
    We also talked a lot about culture. So sometimes that shows the genuineness of
    whether you want to work for the organization or not. So I would say the due diligence
    and assertiveness is something that sets apart “best hires” from other hires.
  sec: 2838
  time: '47:18'
  who: Rahul
- line: What I heard from all this is “If you want to impress a hiring manager, ask
    the recruiters to schedule one more interview.” [laughs]
  sec: 2960

  who: Alexey

  sec: 2968
  time: '49:28'
  who: Rahul
- header: The difference between having knowledge and stuffing a CV with buzzwords
- line: There is a quite related question from Fredrik. The question is about hiring
    data engineers. I also saw this in my work. We often get candidates who just put
    a lot of buzzwords in their CVs, like “big data,” “security,” and “scalable.”
    Then you add a bunch of technologies like Spark, Flink, Pulsar, Kafka. You just
    put a lot of buzzwords there. Of course, I mentioned that these people pass the
    first recruiter filter because all the keywords match, but then at the end, maybe
    apart from the buzzwords, there is no real knowledge. So how would you solve this
    before the interview as a data engineering manager? Is there a way to somehow
    spot these candidates?
  sec: 2975
  time: '49:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Before the interview, it's a little difficult. Because in the screening, you
    just have a profile or resume in front of you. I think nobody even reads the whole
    resume, because we don't have that much time. You just glance at a few things
    and that's it. But regarding the HR discussions, what we did recently is passed
    on certain questions to HR to just get the idea of it. But if some candidate goes
    through it somehow, most of the time I capture this during the hiring manager
    round. These guys sometimes tend to clear the technical rounds as well. But we
    had internal discussions with technical interview panels regarding how to spot
    these things.
  sec: 3030
  time: '50:30'
  who: Rahul
- line: Instead of directly jumping into raw technical questions, we start with another
    way. If we find certain things that are not adding up, like certain technology
    or framework that they claim they worked on, then we ask them to give us a scenario
    of why they used this technology, or in which scenario they used this kind of
    technology. Then you can just simply classify if this guy has just mentioned this
    for the sake of mentioning it or has actually worked with it. This involves asking
    very basic questions. For example, somebody claims “I worked on a data lake and
    data warehouses.” You just ask “What is the difference between a data lake and
    a data warehouse?” Or “on-premise and crowd” these are very basic questions. If
    they are able to articulate or mention this, then fine. Otherwise, you can spot
    these things.
  sec: 3030
  time: '50:30'
  who: Rahul
- line: So basically, you ask about the context in which this technology was used.
    If somebody says that they used Kafka then you ask why Kafka was used for the
    problem they were solving and what were the alternatives – also why they decided
    to use this particular technology versus alternatives.
  sec: 3136
  time: '52:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely, yeah. The context is very important.
  sec: 3154
  time: '52:34'
  who: Rahul
- line: I remember I was also doing CV screening and I saw that a person mentioned
    all these Bash tools like, awk, sed, Perl, and all that. On one hand, I really
    wanted to ask that person, like, “Hey, do you really know all that?” Then, on
    the other hand, because I don't know this myself and people who know these things
    really impress me.
  sec: 3158
  time: '52:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: I wasn't sure if they just put this for the sake of putting this. Let's say,
    if you don't know a technology, but you see somebody put this in their CV and
    you know that this is difficult – it's a complex technology – how do you assess
    if they actually know what they're talking about?
  sec: 3158
  time: '52:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's difficult. It happens sometimes. It's not very often, but it
    happens. What I do is, during the interview, I just open up that particular technology
    or tool that they mentioned – just search on Google, which opens that company
    website or Wikipedia. That gives what this tool is all about in like two lines.
    It comes with experience, also. If you do it again and again, you build the habit
    of understanding a new technology. Maybe not understanding the technology, but
    understanding the concept of the technology and why that exists. At the same time,
    I just open a browser and while the candidate is explaining, I get certain questions
    around those technologies.
  sec: 3203
  time: '53:23'
  who: Rahul
- line: Well, maybe they can also do that, right? Just open the Wikipedia page.
  sec: 3258
  time: '54:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but you can just read a few things from there – the question would not
    be directly from that Wikipedia page on the website.

- header: Advice for students and fresh graduates
- line: Yeah. That makes sense. There is a question from Krushal, who I think is a
    second-year student. The question is, “What would you suggest acing in order to
    become a data engineer?”
  sec: 3274
  time: '54:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: For recent college graduates or students, I would say to focus on the basics.
    Do not jump into any specific tools or technology. Sometimes it happens. It happened
    with me as well, when I was starting my IT journey. That time, I think Informatica
    and all these other tools were very famous in the market. So, don't focus on particular
    tools and technology. Instead, in your college days – focus on basics like, how
    a database management system works, the basics of SQL, and maybe some Python.
    Just try to understand how software engineering works at that point of time. Get
    to know basic terms of what a data warehouse is, what ETL is, before getting too
    attached to any enterprise tools. Build the basics first and then jump into what
    the industry demands are later.

    year of the program, by the time you graduate, the tools that are popular right
    now may not be popular anymore, right?

- line: Informatica was very popular, but now – how many people use it? I think they
    still have a large piece of the market share. But still, I don't think it's as
    widespread as it used to be. So maybe it's better to invest your time in learning
    something that is more commonly used. But how do you know what would be on the
    list in two years? You don't. Right?
  sec: 3369
  time: '56:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's the shift I'm seeing these days. The difference between the “great”
    candidate versus the average candidate you hire. This is a person who is able
    to reinvent themselves again and again. They just get better again, and again
    – that is something that sets you apart from other average candidates who are
    more focused on understanding a technology or tools. If your basics are right
    and these are three-four technologies like querying, Python, etc, then you should
    be good in terms of learning any new tool in the market. These days, these tools
    are very user-friendly, or rather developer-friendly. They're putting a lot of
    good UIs into place and are very easy to use. Thus, it's a matter of a few days
    or weeks to learn a new tool.

    real-time and batch.” [laughs] I think this is too much for one minute that we
    have left, but maybe you can give us an overview?

- line: I think we should have another session dedicated to this piece which can last
    a couple of hours, right? [laughs] But anyway, just to summarize this in a matter
    of a few minutes – there are different pieces of end-to-end data engineering.
    First, you start with the source systems – where data exists. It could be a relational
    database, flat files, cloud, S3 – all these things. You build one data pipeline
    to pull data from the source systems and load it into your data warehouse or data
    lake, which is a centralized data hub.

- line: Then you build one process to expose this data. This is the first part of
    it, you have all the data in a data warehouse, but how can a consumer, who is
    interested in your data, consume it? There could be various methods of consuming
    the data – you have a reporting tool or visualization tool. You also have certain
    API's built on top of your data warehouse platforms, which can serve any applications
    in real-time. You can have another ETL layer for some other consumers who are
    interested in our data. So, this whole end-to-end system can be in batch mode
    as well, which runs daily or weekly loads.
  sec: 3476
  time: '57:56'
  who: Rahul
- line: It can also be event-based as well. The moment the data arrives in a source
    system, you can have certain events listening to that source system. For example,
    let’s say you have an S3 bucket. Your file lands on an S3 bucket, your lambda
    function gets triggered. I am talking in terms of AWS terminologies. That puts
    your reads data from S3 buckets and loads into your data warehouse. That is more
    real-time. Or if you talk about streaming, then you have Kafka or any message
    brokers, which can connect to real-time data with your warehouse. Just to summarize
    this focus, it’s not only about just bringing data into the data warehouse, but
    there’s a second part, which is how you expose that data. If nobody is able to
    consume your data, then your data warehouse is not valuable or useful at all.
