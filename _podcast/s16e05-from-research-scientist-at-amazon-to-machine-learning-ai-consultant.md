short: From a Research Scientist at Amazon to a Machine learning/AI Consultant
title: From a Research Scientist at Amazon to a Machine learning/AI Consultant
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about being a research scientist at Amazon, and transitioning
    from being a research scientist to doing freelancing and consulting. We have a
    special guest today, Verena. Verena has strong expertise in NLP and machine learning,
    with more than seven years of experience. Her background is in statistics, and
    she recently quit her job as a research scientist at Amazon to work as a freelancer.
    Today we will talk about that. Welcome to our interview!
  sec: 63
  time: '1:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks, Aleksey. Glad to be here.
  sec: 94
  time: '1:34'
  who: Verena
- line: Thanks. The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer.
    Thanks, Johanna, for your help.
  sec: 96
  time: '1:36'
  who: Alexey
- header: Verena’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of being research scientists and transitioning
    to a freelancer in machine learning, let's start with your background. Can you
    tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 106
  time: '1:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. Well, [chuckles] it was really pretty much a step-by-step thing. I originally
    studied economics, because I always liked learning languages. But I didn't kind
    of see a career path if I just studied a language, so I decided to do an economic
    study in combination with Chinese studies. [chuckles] I also spent some time in
    China, which was pretty interesting.
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Verena
- line: After some time, I kind of found out that I didn't really like economics that
    much – I found it was a bit… Arbitrary, in the sense that you have some assumptions
    in one model, and then you arrive at a result. But if you change the assumptions,
    then you arrive at a different result. I think, in economics, it's kind of hard
    to verify your assumptions and I found that to be more straightforward in statistics.
    Basically, in the economics Bachelor, you also have a lot of statistics, and there
    was a possibility to focus on statistics more, which I then did.
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Verena
- line: Econometrics, right?
  sec: 188
  time: '3:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, econometrics, time series – all these kinds of things. Then I also did
    my Bachelor Thesis in statistics and went on to do the Master in statistics. Back
    at the time, data science was not that much of a hype yet, so I was really doing
    a lot of classical statistics. But I did have some machine learning and data science
    courses during my Master's. I really liked that a lot better than traditional
    statistics, so I decided… [cross-talk]
  sec: 189
  time: '3:09'
  who: Verena
- line: Did you study in Berlin?
  sec: 217
  time: '3:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: I did the Master's in Berlin, yeah. This was a joint statistics program from
    the Free University, Humboldt University, and the Technical University. They have
    this Joint Master Program. Basically, I discovered data science and machine learning
    during that program and decided, “Okay, this is what I want to work on.” I was
    trying to find a job in Berlin and data science after finishing the Master's,
    but in 2017, there were almost no data science positions in Berlin. Also, Zalando,
    at the time, was not hiring data scientists in Berlin – only in Dublin, but I
    didn't want to go to Dublin. [chuckles]
  sec: 219
  time: '3:39'
  who: Verena
- line: So then I decided to go to Deloitte, which is a consulting company. They were
    just building up this Deloitte Analytics Institute, which had a focus on engineering
    and data science. So I basically started out there as a consultant and stayed
    there for about two years, which was quite interesting, because you could basically
    look into different industries, but I also had the chance to work with very different
    machine learning use cases. I worked on image recognition, NLP, but also time
    series anomaly detection – so a very broad range of things, but it was usually
    more on a “proof of concept” level. I wanted to go a little bit deeper into the
    topics and then decided to move on from Deloitte.
  sec: 219
  time: '3:39'
  who: Verena
- line: I then moved on to Oetker Digital, briefly. It was like an in-house consultancy
    for the Oetker Group. I did some forecasting and time series there. But then I
    felt like, “Okay, I actually want to work with bigger datasets and really do machine
    learning.” That is why I then moved on to mobile.de, which, at that time, was
    part of eBay, and is a platform where you can buy or sell cars. Yeah, they definitely
    had more data. [chuckles] I was working on causal inference – we were looking
    into whether certain purchases were made because the customer received an advertisement
    beforehand, or a certain marketing campaign.
  sec: 219
  time: '3:39'
  who: Verena
- line: And then, I actually moved on to Amazon, because I had the chance to join
    the Amazon Alexa team in Berlin. Since my passion has always been in natural language
    processing and working with language, again, this was the perfect opportunity
    to combine this.
  sec: 219
  time: '3:39'
  who: Verena
- line: And then, after Amazon?
  sec: 393
  time: '6:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: After Amazon? [chuckles] Yeah, now I'm working as a freelance Generative AI
    Consultant, enabling small and medium businesses to prepare for the GenAI revolution
    that we're going to witness in the next few years.
  sec: 397
  time: '6:37'
  who: Verena
- header: Getting hired at Amazon without a Phd
- line: I have a lot of questions about that. But first, I was curious to learn more
    about your transition from a data scientist to a research scientist, because I
    remember… When I was working as a data scientist, I kind of missed doing a bit
    of research. Usually you work on industry problems, but you just take XGBoost
    or logistic regression, you apply it, and then roll it out to production. Then
    you spend most of the time either preparing the data or deploying the model, while
    the machine learning part was only like one day of work, and the rest – the entire
    six months (or whatever) – is some other work.
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was kind of missing the research part – this algorithmic part. I once tried
    to apply to a research scientist position – I think back then, it was at Zalando
    – and they told me something like, “Hey, you don't have a PhD. Maybe get a PhD
    first, and then we'll talk.” But you don't seem to have a PhD. How did you actually
    convince Amazon to hire you without a PhD?
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Actually, I think it's changing a bit. I mean, of course, there are
    still a lot of research roles where you must have a PhD, but it also depends on
    the company. Amazon, in general, is a company that doesn't have pure research
    roles, like DeepMind or Google Brain or something. So it's always a bit more with
    a focus on customer problems and application and how to bring it to production.
    I think now, they also changed it in their job descriptions, where it says something
    like, “Okay, you either have a PhD or relevant work experience.”
  sec: 489
  time: '8:09'
  who: Verena
- line: Then I think another reason why I got the job was because I think the team
    was kind of young, and they were looking for people to join. In the beginning,
    it's always a bit easier to get in. And then, I think, for our team specifically,
    we had a mixture of people with a PhD and people without a PhD, so I think that
    is why it worked. Because then you can also really learn from the people who have
    a PhD, some things that you might miss or some skills that you might lack. Yeah,
    that's how it worked. [chuckles]
  sec: 489
  time: '8:09'
  who: Verena
- line: I guess this requirement comes from… The reason that exists is because the
    companies are interested in knowing if you can do research or not. And if you
    have a PhD, then clearly you know how to do research, right? Because you published
    at least three papers and you've defended the thesis – you clearly know how to
    do research. If you haven't done that, then it's not clear if you can do this
    or not. Because it requires patience, it requires a sort of research mindset,
    which not everyone has.
  sec: 571
  time: '9:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I think so. But then, I also think that research at Amazon in this role
    is not exactly like research in academia, where you work three years on one topic.
    I think maybe they also realized that, “Okay, people with certain industry experience
    also bring some qualities to the table.” And I think maybe they found out that,
    “If we mix the teams, we have a good combination of the two, and we can actually
    leverage both skill sets.”
  sec: 605
  time: '10:05'
  who: Verena
- header: Research at Amazon
- line: You said that research at Amazon is not the same as research in academia.
    So what does research at Amazon look like? What do you actually do there?
  sec: 641
  time: '10:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I mean… [chuckles] The way that I heard from my colleagues in terms
    of how research works in academia – I only did my Master thesis, I didn't do a
    PhD. But I have a rough understanding of how it works there. But let me explain
    how it works at Amazon, because I definitely have a better understanding there.
    Like I said, there's this principle at Amazon that you always do research with
    a focus on the customer’s problems. You never just do research to solve any kind
    of problem, but it always has to be a customer problem. And you always have to
    focus on the application and how to bring it into the production system afterwards.
  sec: 649
  time: '10:49'
  who: Verena
- line: So, from the very beginning, before you even start the research project, you
    know how it will be applied. Right? You have to know before you start.
  sec: 693
  time: '11:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Basically, before you start, there's three things you need to look into.
    First, “What is the customer problem? How do we define the problem clearly?” Then,
    second, “What are the possible solutions?” and, “How are they going to solve the
    customer problem?” So, really, we also did some estimates on impact and all these
    kinds of things. And then, “How can you bring it into production? What's the effort
    to bring it into production? Is it feasible to roll out to production?” I think
    that what kind of differentiates from this normal data science role that you talked
    about is – you work with cutting-edge machine learning models. You don't learn
    with XGBoost – you don't work with XGBoost, like you mentioned. You really work
    with state-of-the-art research.
  sec: 702
  time: '11:42'
  who: Verena
- line: You look into the papers, you look at the existing approaches, and then you
    adapt them to your problem at hand. This is really cool, because Amazon also really
    promotes this strong link to academia, where you really rely on cutting-edge research
    to solve these customer problems. Of course, also, the models that we worked with
    were already quite state-of-the-art. One part that I also didn't do in any other
    job before was publishing papers. We had a goal each year to publish papers in
    academic conferences – for example, ACL or EMNLP. We also attended academic conferences.
    Whereas, in my previous role as a data scientist, I usually went to industry-oriented
    conferences.
  sec: 702
  time: '11:42'
  who: Verena
- line: That's interesting, because I know that publishing papers in these top-tier
    conferences is already hard enough. But in addition to that, you also have to
    think, “How am I going to put this thing into production?” So you kind of have
    two jobs in one, tight?
  sec: 810
  time: '13:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. It's challenging. [chuckles] It's not easy. But I also have to say
    – there is not only the research track anymore, but these conferences now also
    often have industry tracks. So there, it's not that much about the novelty of
    the approach. What's especially important is that you also don't necessarily have
    to publish results on open-source datasets. Because sometimes we didn't have the
    time to really run experiments on an open-source dataset, but, of course, we couldn't
    release the dataset that we were using for experiments. I mean, there are also
    teams and scientists who publish at the research track, but we also published
    in the industry track a lot.
  sec: 826
  time: '13:46'
  who: Verena
- line: Because, for these conferences – for this industry track – what is interesting
    is the applications of these state-of-the-art methods. Right? One thing is – yes,
    you can develop this state-of-the-art algorithm and then test it on the usual
    benchmarks, but what about applying it to real-life problems? And this is what
    you do, right? Then you publish research on that, “We had this problem and this
    is how we used the state-of-the-art to solve it.”
  sec: 877
  time: '14:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Sometimes we also extended the state-of-the-art thing – it's not like
    there was no novelty at all, but it's maybe not as much novelty as it would have
    to be for the research track. Also, there was less overhead, let's say, when publishing
    in the industry track. Because usually, we run experiments on internal datasets,
    but running experiments on public datasets is extra work, which you don't always
    have the time for.
  sec: 911
  time: '15:11'
  who: Verena
- line: Yeah, When it comes to novelty, I remember eight years ago, when I was doing
    my Master’s at TU Berlin, one of the criteria for the Master’s was novelty. And
    I'm like, “Okay, I'm a student. I don't know much. And now you’re asking me to
    work on novelty? How is that even possible?” And what my advisor told me was that,
    “Taking existing things and applying them to something (to a dataset or a category
    or a domain) that nobody has applied them to, and seeing what the results are,
    is already super novel.” So you can… [cross-talk]
  sec: 938
  time: '15:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. That's also one way to go. That's also something that we did
    – I mean, taking something from image and applying it to NLP. Yeah.
  sec: 974
  time: '16:14'
  who: Verena
- header: Publishing papers and solving customer problems
- line: I'm curious – so, the goal was to actually solve customers’ problems but yet,
    you had another goal, publishing papers – which was more important? Was publishing
    papers the main KPI?
  sec: 986
  time: '16:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: The main KPI is customer problems, because that's the first thing that you
    do – that’s the work that you do, and then afterwards you publish the paper. It's
    not in parallel.
  sec: 1000
  time: '16:40'
  who: Verena
- line: So you have two KPIs but the business metric is more important – that you
    solve the customer problem – and then papers are more like a “nice to have,” right?
    Or is it still important? If you don't publish, then you're not a researcher,
    right? [chuckles]
  sec: 1016
  time: '16:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah. I mean, it''s still important. There are internal goals
    for papers. I mean, Amazon also has an interest in people publishing because it
    helps their reputation, it helps them attract talent. But then, also, for you
    as a research scientist – you are intrinsically very motivated to do that, because
    it''s a nice way to sum up your work and to showcase it and to also go into that
    exchange with other people. But, of course, the first one is always the customer
    problem and the business, and then the paper.'
  sec: 1033
  time: '17:13'
  who: Verena
- line: As we speak, I'm looking at your LinkedIn profile and I see that you worked
    at Amazon for three years, nine months – so almost four years. How many papers
    (research projects) did you get a chance to work on?
  sec: 1069
  time: '17:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: So, there were more research projects than papers. We didn't always have the
    time to publish. For research projects – I think four or five. Usually, you have
    like one… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1084
  time: '18:04'
  who: Verena
- line: So, one per year, approximately. Right?
  sec: 1096
  time: '18:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. You have something like one focus project per year. And then for
    papers – I think it's four papers? [chuckles] Yeah.
  sec: 1097
  time: '18:17'
  who: Verena
- line: In your Google Scholar that I have open right now, it’s four.
  sec: 1105
  time: '18:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it’s four.
  sec: 1110
  time: '18:30'
  who: Verena
- line: That's like one paper per year as well, right? So, five projects, four papers.
  sec: 1111
  time: '18:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, the project… it depends. I mean, I definitely had more than
    five projects, but then the question is, “What is your role in the project? Are
    you the leading scientist on that one or are you just contributing or giving feedback?”
    But yeah, I think it was like five or six, where I was the lead in the research
    project. But then we also have other projects. I also have a more software-oriented
    project. You don't only have research tasks.
  sec: 1116
  time: '18:36'
  who: Verena
- header: What it means to be a leading scientist on a project at Amazon
- line: What does it mean to be a leading scientist on a project?
  sec: 1147
  time: '19:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: That means you are the owner of the project. You're responsible for defining
    the problem, trying out different solutions, communicating with stakeholders,
    giving the initial approaches, – you can, of course, work with other people and
    go collect feedback and ideas and input, but you're the main responsible person
    to successfully finish the project.
  sec: 1151
  time: '19:11'
  who: Verena
- line: Must be difficult. If you come from industry without much research experience,
    apart from writing your Master Thesis, and now, all of a sudden, you have to lead
    a data science project. That's probably not the easiest thing to do, right?
  sec: 1186
  time: '19:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I didn't find it that difficult. Actually, I really enjoyed it because
    I really missed this research part, and this part of reading about new approaches,
    and learning, and trying out new things, instead of just going to the standard
    solution that you already know and have in the back of the mind. I mean, of course,
    you also kind of grow into that. I think my first project was about labeling –
    how to label data efficiently.
  sec: 1202
  time: '20:02'
  who: Verena
- line: This is, of course, a bit easier than maybe later on, when we looked into
    how to generate adversarial attacks with a T5 model. This has more technical complexity.
    Then, of course, what I have to say is that you also have a lot of support at
    Amazon. This is really great. You have a lot of competent people around you and
    you really have this culture of collaboration. So whoever you reach out to, they
    will always be happy to support you. And I really enjoyed the challenge to kind
    of catch up on this.
  sec: 1202
  time: '20:02'
  who: Verena
- line: And also prove that you don't need to have a PhD to be a scientist. Right?
  sec: 1274
  time: '21:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, for me, it was not really about proving something. Yes, of course,
    there was this topic of, “Okay. Do I need a PhD? I don't need a PhD?” But I was
    just happy that I finally could do the tasks that I enjoy.
  sec: 1279
  time: '21:19'
  who: Verena
- header: Does having a PhD give you an edge in industry?
- line: The reason I brought it up was because there is a question from Atita. The
    question is, “How does having a PhD help getting some leverage over those who
    don't?” I guess the reason she's asking is, as I see from the question, “Do you
    really need to have a PhD? Does it really give you an edge when it comes to doing
    research at industry companies like Amazon?”
  sec: 1296
  time: '21:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, first of all, it definitely can be. It depends on the team. It depends
    on the hiring managers. There are teams and managers who have that as a first
    requirement. So if you want to go to one of those teams, then you definitely need
    it. Once you're in? I don't know. I think it depends a lot on you. It also depends
    on what kind of PhD you did, maybe? But it's also a bit hard for me to say, because
    I don't really know what the benefit is. I mean, what do you really take out of
    it? Because I didn't do it. [Alexey agrees]
  sec: 1323
  time: '22:03'
  who: Verena
- line: I think, yes, it can be an entry ticket, and you probably learn some skills
    that are useful. But then on the other hand, you can also argue it the other way,
    right? I think it really depends on where you want to go and, if in that environment,
    you really need it and if you want to do it – yeah.
  sec: 1323
  time: '22:03'
  who: Verena
- header: An example of Verena’s published paper
- line: I'm looking at your Google Scholar, and there is one paper with six citations
    that you published in 2021, which is, “Is it better to verify semi-supervised
    learning with a human in the loop or large scale NLU models?” It’s a long name.
    [chuckles] Can you maybe tell us more about this paper?
  sec: 1391
  time: '23:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. [chuckles] Basically, let me give you a quick introduction of the setup
    that we were working in. My team was in charge of the natural language understanding
    models for German and French and we would have to update these models on a regular
    basis. We would retrain them every time before we release them. Well, among other
    things, we also added new training data in each update. And this training data
    would… some of the training data would come from a random sample of live traffic.
    The old process was that, basically, this training data gets annotated by human
    annotators before we ingest it into training.
  sec: 1413
  time: '23:33'
  who: Verena
- line: As you can imagine, this is quite costly and time-consuming and, of course,
    not something that's desirable for business. So we thought about, “Okay, how can
    we save some costs, speed up the process?” and so forth. The solution that we
    describe in the paper is, basically, instead of showing the annotator just the
    simple request (without any hints on how to annotate or anything) we run this
    request through the NLU model and show the annotator the output from the NLU model.
    Then the annotator just has to understand, “Okay, is the NLU model right?” If
    yes, they just take it off and send it right into the training set. And if not,
    they only have to correct it – they don't have to annotate the full utterance
    from scratch.
  sec: 1413
  time: '23:33'
  who: Verena
- line: So it saves time. Right?
  sec: 1518
  time: '25:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: It saves time. Exactly. But it also reduces the annotation volume a lot. I
    mean, if you imagine – Alexa was launched, I think seven or eight years ago now
    – and German was one of the first languages that came after English. So the model
    already has some kind of maturity – it already has a certain level of accuracy.
    So the annotator actually doesn't have to make that many corrections. Another
    thing that we found that's quite interesting (that we didn't expect) was – it
    also leads to more consistent annotation.
  sec: 1520
  time: '25:20'
  who: Verena
- line: If you can imagine, you just show the utterance to the annotator and then
    they just annotate as they think – they don't have a primer or some kind of bias,
    which sometimes could also lead to the same utterance being annotated in a different
    way. This gave us inconsistencies in the training set. Through this approach,
    since the model gives you one interpretation, then another annotator gets biased
    into one direction. You have more consistency in the training data.
  sec: 1520
  time: '25:20'
  who: Verena
- line: You might have my voice somewhere in the training data because I have an Alexa
    speaker. We use German because my son speaks only Russian and German – he doesn't
    speak English. We thought, “Okay, I will practice pronouncing in German and we'll
    see if Alexa understands me or not.” [chuckles] So maybe you have that in the
    training data, too.
  sec: 1593
  time: '26:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe. Yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 1618
  time: '26:58'
  who: Verena
- line: But overall, the product problem was – you wanted to improve the accuracy
    of Alexa, right?
  sec: 1620
  time: '27:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The customer problem for this is example accuracy, yes. But then, sometimes
    the project will also end in improving our internal processes and reducing costs.
  sec: 1628
  time: '27:08'
  who: Verena
- line: So in this case, it was mostly driven by cost reduction, but in the end, it
    also impacted accuracy because you have a better dataset. [Verena agrees] There
    was already a process where you bring in more data to improve the model, and you
    just want it to make this process cheaper. Right?
  sec: 1642
  time: '27:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Cheaper, faster. Yeah.
  sec: 1662
  time: '27:42'
  who: Verena
- header: Evaluating models and high-performing Alexa utterances
- line: How do you evaluate the performance of these models? I guess, you send it
    to the annotators – they say “Yes, no.” Right?
  sec: 1667
  time: '27:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Usually, we just have test sets – we have a bunch of different test sets.
    After training, the model is just run on different test sets and then we just
    look at certain kinds of metrics. Sometimes, for very high-performing utterances,
    we would also do some extra checks to make sure that they still work after retraining
    the model. That was actually one of the other projects I worked on – to reduce
    the effort.
  sec: 1678
  time: '27:58'
  who: Verena
- line: It was to really make sure that all the high-traffic utterances still work
    after retraining. We worked on an approach to make the model more stable. So basically,
    when you retrain it, you put more weight on utterances that have high traffic
    such that they get interpreted correctly.
  sec: 1678
  time: '27:58'
  who: Verena
- line: I remember, for me, the main problem with Alexa was – when I asked it to play
    a song, I said it in German, and then the song name was in English. It didn't
    always get the song name correctly. I don't know how these models work when you
    mix two languages.
  sec: 1734
  time: '28:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: It should actually work because the song name is an entity, and we keep those
    entities in English (if it's an English song). It should work. But it could, of
    course, also be an ASR issue. The ASR model didn't properly transcribe the pronunciation.
    That could lead to ASR issues. But sometimes, if the song is not very popular,
    it can be that it just didn't work that well. [chuckles]
  sec: 1761
  time: '29:21'
  who: Verena
- line: Songs by Queen – most of the time, it played the song I asked. If it's popular,
    like Queen, or something like that. Less popular, yeah. You're right. I guess
    it depends on how much traffic you get for a particular song. Right?
  sec: 1791
  time: '29:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. If something goes wrong, the more often it goes wrong, the higher
    the probability someone else will notice.
  sec: 1809
  time: '30:09'
  who: Verena
- line: If it’s a song that somebody asks to play once a year, then – okay.
  sec: 1818
  time: '30:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, you're not gonna find that in the traffic? It’s just too much loss.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 1823
  time: '30:23'
  who: Verena
- line: I see. Maybe this is internal data, but what's the most popular request to
    Alexa?
  sec: 1830
  time: '30:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know. I also would not be allowed to share, I guess. [chuckles]
  sec: 1834
  time: '30:34'
  who: Verena
- line: Okay. [chuckles] For me, it was mostly the timer. So I was using it to set
    timers for stuff.
  sec: 1839
  time: '30:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, the most popular domains are probably music, timer, weather – those
    are used very often.
  sec: 1845
  time: '30:45'
  who: Verena
- line: I was also checking her up. It's “her” right? Because I can use different
    voices, but it was speaking with a female voice to me. I guess it's a difficult
    question – What's the gender for this AI model?
  sec: 1852
  time: '30:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would just say “her,” probably. Just because the name is already female.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 1869
  time: '31:09'
  who: Verena
- line: Because it’s “Alexa,” right?
  sec: 1872
  time: '31:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly.
  sec: 1873
  time: '31:13'
  who: Verena
- line: But also, it's kind of similar to Alexey. There is a funny story. I was talking
    to my colleague, who had an Alexa in his room – and every time he said my name,
    Alexa would activate.
  sec: 1874
  time: '31:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, of course. [chuckles] It’s close, yeah.
  sec: 1895
  time: '31:35'
  who: Verena
- header: Verena as a freelancer
- line: '[laughs] Okay, yeah. Recently, you decided to focus on something else that''s
    quite different from what you were doing, right? Now, you''re a freelancer. Can
    you maybe tell us more about that? What do you do now and how did you make this
    decision to change your career and start freelancing?'
  sec: 1903
  time: '31:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I don't know if it's… I mean, it is different in the sense that I'm
    not working on one model anymore. But, of course, there is still going to be quite
    some overlap in terms of topic. As I said before, my goal is to support companies
    in the adoption of AI, especially generative AI with text, and keep them competitive
    in the long run because that's going to be crucial to enhance productivity. There's
    a lot of overlap there, in the kind of technology that I'm working with. Also,
    since I worked at Deloitte before, where I was already in this technical consulting
    role, there is some overlap there. Of course, the working mode is very different
    because it's the first time that I'm not employed anymore. [chuckles] This also
    means you have to take care of everything now. You have to get new clients, get
    new projects, you have to market yourself, you have to promote yourself – you
    also have to send out the invoices in the end and you have to take care of your
    taxes. [chuckles] That is, of course, different.
  sec: 1927
  time: '32:07'
  who: Verena
- line: I think the second part of your question was how I made this decision, right?
    [Alexey confirms] In general, I think you can have a lot of impact if you support
    these smaller to medium sized businesses in adopting AI. I think in Germany, this
    is especially important because we're lagging behind with adoption of AI digitalization
    and innovation. So I see that I can make a contribution there. But, in general,
    I just also wanted to think and work in a more entrepreneurial way – have more
    freedom in the way of how you work, what you work on, who you work with. Another
    thing, actually, that really led to this decision was that I wanted to have the
    possibility to also venture out in new areas. Doing several things in parallel
    I think is easier if you're self-employed versus if you're working full time or
    even, let's say 80% or 75% in corporate.
  sec: 1927
  time: '32:07'
  who: Verena
- line: So you can consult on projects in different domains (in different areas) and
    then understand, “Okay, maybe I'll like healthcare more than food tech (for example).”
  sec: 2086
  time: '34:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, or maybe also just doing something completely different on the side.
    It’s kind of having different things that you do – not just doing one thing five
    days a week.
  sec: 2095
  time: '34:55'
  who: Verena
- line: You mean not doing just data science and research, but also doing something
    else, like working on your own product.
  sec: 2107
  time: '35:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Yeah – working on my own product, and other projects as well. Yeah.
  sec: 2117
  time: '35:17'
  who: Verena
- line: Like personal projects or professional projects?
  sec: 2126
  time: '35:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, one…
  sec: 2132
  time: '35:32'
  who: Verena
- line: Or both, right? [laughs]
  sec: 2133
  time: '35:33'
  who: Alexey
- header: Verena’s goals to support women in IT
- line: Yeah, both. And maybe also have a bit more overlap between the two. One of
    the things that I want to do is support women in AI. Maybe you know about this
    study from Kinsey digital, that [says] half of women leave the tech industry at
    the midpoint of their career, which is double the rate for men.
  sec: 2135
  time: '35:35'
  who: Verena
- line: You mean leave and then not come back?
  sec: 2162
  time: '36:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Leave for good – they just leave the industry behind. This is, of
    course, detrimental.
  sec: 2165
  time: '36:05'
  who: Verena
- line: Do you know why? Is it because women need to give birth to kids and they stay
    longer with kids, usually, than men? Is that the reason? Or is the reason something
    else?
  sec: 2171
  time: '36:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I think that's not the only reason. I mean, yes, part of it is that –
    because they don't feel like they have enough flexibility to combine the job with
    the family. I think the article also said that a lot of women still feel like
    they have to do more to be successful – they feel isolated, they don't feel recognized,
    they think it's hard to get promoted. I think they also just get a bit frustrated
    with these things that are, at least to some extent, due to a lack of diversity
    in the industry.
  sec: 2185
  time: '36:25'
  who: Verena
- line: So you want to support women. There was research, and I interrupted you.
  sec: 2235
  time: '37:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So that is one of the other projects that I want to work on. I'm not
    exactly sure what it's gonna look like – I'm still working on the concept of how
    I'm gonna do that. [chuckles] But it's definitely something I want to spend more
    time on. That is, of course, easier in a freelance role. I'm gonna share updates
    on LinkedIn. So if anyone is interested, you can follow me there. [chuckles]
  sec: 2239
  time: '37:19'
  who: Verena

  sec: 2266

  sec: 2274
  time: '37:54'
  who: Verena
- header: The challenges of being self-employed
- line: When I became self-employed this year, I was very surprised by how expensive
    health insurance is in Germany. Maybe it's less expensive than in the States,
    but still, when all these costs (all these taxes) are hidden and being a full-time
    employee, you just receive your salary, you don't worry about all these taxes,
    health insurance, pension – all that.
  sec: 2275
  time: '37:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: You just receive a certain amount of money in your bank account and you go
    spend it. But now, you receive some money, then you need to set aside some money
    for paying taxes, and then, all of a sudden, it turns out you have to pay 900
    euros to health insurance every month. For me, it was surprising. [chuckles] Now
    you have to deal with all that yourself. Right?
  sec: 2275
  time: '37:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, yes. That's also the part that I don't enjoy as much. [chuckles]
    In general, what I like is really that I have more variety of tasks now.
  sec: 2328
  time: '38:48'
  who: Verena
- header: Verena’s pitch deck
- line: Can you tell us what you’re working on?
  sec: 2343
  time: '39:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Currently, I'm actually just working on my positioning – my pitch deck on
    my website on this Women in AI Support Project. I actually consciously decided
    to not take any projects this year, at least not bigger projects – because I think
    this initial phase of setting yourself up and also, frankly, taking a bit of a
    break [chuckles] after Amazon, I think is quite important. So then you really
    feel prepared and recharged. I could imagine that once you really get into projects,
    you might not have the headspace anymore to think more about strategic things.
  sec: 2346
  time: '39:06'
  who: Verena
- line: Can you tell us a bit more about this positioning pitch deck? You probably
    have started already. Let's imagine that I’m working as a full-time employee and
    now I think, “Okay, I want to be a freelancer.” So what do I do now? How do I
    position myself? How do I come up with this pitch deck?
  sec: 2398
  time: '39:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's a combination of, “Okay, what are my skills? What are my strengths?
    What value do I bring?” And then you kind of look on the other side, “Okay, what
    is it that potential customers need? What is my target group there? What are their
    problems? How can I support them?” And then you try to find this intersection
    and you basically define the problems that they have and that they want to solve.
    So you kind of put yourself in their shoes and imagine, “Okay, what is it that
    they really want to tackle and how can I support them with that?” What I also
    did (now in my specific case) is all this transformation that's going to happen
    with generative AI.
  sec: 2423
  time: '40:23'
  who: Verena
- line: Basically, I looked into, “Okay, what are some studies that underpin or show
    how Gen AI is going to transform the way we work?” And then you just showcase
    your skills, your experience, and you define certain offerings. For example, in
    my case, it's something like a generative AI discovery workshop, where this can
    be something in between half a day to two days and it can be just an introduction
    to generative AI – or it can already go more into use case definition for that
    certain client. So you set up or you define certain offerings – to showcase how
    you can support them.
  sec: 2423
  time: '40:23'
  who: Verena
- header: Finding your audience and identifying their pain points
- line: So with skills that I have – with the strengths and values that I can bring
    – it's more or less clear. Maybe it's not always… I always know that these are
    my strengths. I know, more or less, what I'm good at, what I'm not good at, if
    I work full time. But when it comes to knowing what potential customers want,
    and who these potential customers are in the first place – it's more problematic,
    because I might have no idea.
  sec: 2519
  time: '41:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I know that I'm good at, let's say, machine learning deployment (deploying
    ML models). I know that I can do this. But, with the knowledge of the skills that
    I have and the values I can bring to the company, how can I find potential customers
    (identify the group) and understand what they’re struggling with?
  sec: 2519
  time: '41:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: One thing could be just finding people in your network that work for companies
    that you might want to work for, and then talk to them. Ask them, “What are you
    struggling with? Is there anything you struggled with in that area where you bring
    those skills?” I mean, one thing that I do now is – I'm a mentor in the Data Action
    Network Mentorship Program. This is a program where startups can book a call with
    mentors – they pay a subscription fee, and then they can book a call with mentors,
    and they just talk to you about some of the problems that they have.
  sec: 2575
  time: '42:55'
  who: Verena
- line: Of course, this also helps me to understand what problems they are trying
    to solve. Another thing is, sometimes you just say that you work freelance – you
    introduce yourself on LinkedIn as a freelancer and on certain networks, and so
    on. Then sometimes people already reach out to you, and then you just talk to
    them and try to understand what they're looking for, what the problems that they're
    trying to solve are. This also gives you ideas. Of course, it's only a starting
    point and once you do your first project, you can always iterate and update –
    second project, and so on.
  sec: 2575
  time: '42:55'
  who: Verena
- line: Okay, so I know what my strengths and skills are – then I should have some
    network and some companies where I want to work, and then reach out to people
    in these companies saying, “Hey, I'm a freelancer. I can help you. Maybe we can
    talk?” And then I start asking what they need help with. Right? And then I see,
    “Okay, these are the problems. This is how I can help.”
  sec: 2658
  time: '44:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, or you just ask the people that you know. Maybe it's a bit easier in
    the beginning.
  sec: 2683
  time: '44:43'
  who: Verena
- line: Right, instead of going like this…
  sec: 2688
  time: '44:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Cold calls on LinkedIn. They’re not gonna immediately share the problems with
    you, so you can ask people that you know. Or you can go to events. I think there
    was this event called Seamless, which was about the payment industry. I mean,
    if you just look up “events in Berlin,” “tech events in Berlin,” you can also
    find quite interesting, helpful events where you can meet potential clients or
    learn more about the industry and what they’re struggling with.
  sec: 2692
  time: '44:52'
  who: Verena
- line: Yeah. You also mentioned mentoring. This is actually an interesting thing.
    So people come to you to tell you about their problems, right? You can take notes
    on what kind of problems there are. I guess the volume is like a few people asking
    for a short mentorship call and then you can summarize and you can see patterns
    there. Like, “Startups come with this sort of problem.” And then you can see “Okay,
    interesting. I can help them.”
  sec: 2725
  time: '45:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly that. Also reading market research. Now, if you Google… Of course,
    I'm in a lucky position that this generative AI topic is now very much the hype,
    so you have a lot of reports on how this is going to transform the way we work
    and what new problems companies will have to solve with the adoption of that.
    So you can also just go and find market research from consultancies or banks.
  sec: 2755
  time: '45:55'
  who: Verena
- line: The approach with mentoring is pretty interesting. I spoke with a few people
    – I spoke with one guy who is doing courses and I asked him, “How did you come
    up with these courses that you offer?” And he said that first he did not offer
    any courses. What he offered was mentorship. He got a few students who he would
    mentor and then he would ask them what they struggle with. Then, from 6-10 students,
    he was able to understand that most people (at least from these ten) struggle
    with these problems, and then based on that, he developed a course. I guess it's
    sort of similar, right? You take a few short-term clients, these people that you
    mentor (mentees) – then you speak with them, you understand what they struggle
    with, and then, based on that, you shape your offering, or your position. Right?
  sec: 2789
  time: '46:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. Or at least you have a first stance on it. Then you do the
    first project and then you iterate. Eventually, this can also lead into creating
    a product if you see that, “Okay, almost every client has the same problem,” then
    maybe you can think about, “How can I create a product to provide a solution for
    that?”

    natural language processing has always been the area that I'm most passionate

    Yeah, it''s very mind-blowing and interesting. I like this intersection of human

    models are.'
  sec: 2892

    working on positioning yourself and your pitch deck. Right? So what comes in the
    pitch deck? What we discussed right now, but in a short deck?
  sec: 2922
  time: '48:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. What I'm doing first is building a long deck that has a couple of slides
    that really have everything in it. Basically, some slides show, “Okay, why do
    you have to act on this generative AI revolution? What are the facts? What can
    generative AI do? What is the potential? What are the risks?” And then some slides
    on who I am, what my experience is, why I'm in a good position to take on or support
    clients in this task.
  sec: 2948
  time: '49:08'
  who: Verena
- line: Some slides regarding my offering, some slides… I actually have a list of
    reference projects from my corporate career there. And then, also, the daily rate
    and how to get in touch. So this is a very long presentation. But then once I
    have this long pitch deck, I can just shorten it based on the audience or on the
    need. I can also build the website based on that – it’s just a different kind
    of display format.
  sec: 2948
  time: '49:08'
  who: Verena
- line: I guess it's needed for an interview, right? When I'm being interviewed for
    a full-time position, there is a process. First, I need to talk with recruiters
    and the hiring manager, then there is a set of technical interviews. But for freelancers,
    I guess this is an interview where you present this pitch deck. Right?
  sec: 3026
  time: '50:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Well, I don't think you can get a project if you don't have a pitch
    deck. I already had some requests, and could have started working on a project,
    even without a website (without a pitch deck). But I am choosing to do that because
    I think it helps me position myself because I want to work on certain topics.
    I want to be standing for certain topics – not just anything and everything. It's
    also an interesting thing, because as I said, I want to think more entrepreneurial,
    and this is part of that. It's fun. [chuckles] I also like venturing out in a
    new field where I don't have that much experience and learning something new.
  sec: 3047
  time: '50:47'
  who: Verena
- line: So even without this pitch deck, you already have some potential projects.
    How? Is it because people from your network already know that you are a freelancer
    and they came to you before somebody else took you?
  sec: 3102
  time: '51:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's basically my network and also posts on LinkedIn. Posting, “I'm
    a freelancer now.” Definitely posts with machine learning content. Like I said
    before, I'm in this lucky position that currently, this generative AI – there's
    a need for a lot of experts, so the demand is higher than the supply. So this,
    of course, makes it easier for me.

    with machine learning to tailor to the user''s needs. But I also post a lot about
    the things I learn, things that helped me – I also really like personal growth
    topics. So basically, anything that I find interesting. [chuckles]'

- line: Yeah, I'm looking at your feed right now and what caught my attention is exactly
    not a post about machine learning. There's a picture where you’re sitting on the
    floor, and there are different things… I don't even know. What is that?
  sec: 3192

- line: Crystal balls? What is that?
  sec: 3214
  time: '53:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah. [chuckles] It's crystal balls – they’re balls made of quartz.
    You basically play them, and then they make a very soothing, calming sound. Usually,
    people would just lie down, close their eyes, you would play the balls, and then
    the sound waves have a very physical effect on their body. They slow down their
    brainwaves and you also can feel the sound in different areas of your body.
  sec: 3215
  time: '53:35'
  who: Verena
- line: This helps people to go into a relaxed and calm state. I discovered that for
    myself like two years ago. Yeah, I really, really love doing sound baths. Now,
    sometimes I also give sound baths. It’s one of my side projects that I mentioned
    before. [chuckles]
  sec: 3215
  time: '53:35'
  who: Verena
- line: Mm-hmm. Interesting. Now you have more flexibility to actually do this. Right?
  sec: 3270
  time: '54:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I also did that while I was working at Amazon. Sound baths are something
    you do for an hour. It's not like another full-time job. I actually also did one
    at Amazon, which was pretty cool. [chuckles]
  sec: 3276
  time: '54:36'
  who: Verena
- line: In the office?
  sec: 3291
  time: '54:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: In the office, yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 3292
  time: '54:52'
  who: Verena
- line: Do you have any of these balls somewhere near you right now?
  sec: 3293
  time: '54:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no. Sorry. Not here. I can send you a YouTube video if you want to. [chuckles]
    I have a recorded video.
  sec: 3299
  time: '54:59'
  who: Verena
- header: The importance of building a foundation based on formal education
- line: Yeah, please do. Okay, that's very interesting. Let me check if we have questions.
    Yeah. A question from Taras. Taras asks, “What role did your formal education
    (school and university) play in your career?”
  sec: 3306
  time: '55:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: What role did it play in my career? I mean, it was definitely the foundation.
    I think coming from a technical background is important if you want to work in
    machine learning. Statistics and probability, of course, are closely related to
    the field. So it was the foundation. Also, I think, being able to read technical
    papers, being able to read mathematical equations – I mean, of course, you can
    always learn things later, but the earlier you start with that, the easier it
    is.
  sec: 3325
  time: '55:25'
  who: Verena
- line: You studied machine learning during your Master’s, right?
  sec: 3367
  time: '56:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. But then, of course, it didn't stop there. You always have
    to keep learning. [chuckles]
  sec: 3374
  time: '56:14'
  who: Verena
- line: Of course. Did you also attend machine learning courses from Technical University
    or was it some other university?
  sec: 3379
  time: '56:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, actually. I attended the one at Humboldt University.
  sec: 3388
  time: '56:28'
  who: Verena
- line: At the Technical University, there is the quite famous Professor Muller. [Verena
    agrees] He worked on support vector machines and this is what he taught, mostly,
    because he did a lot of research in this area. In many of his classes, he was
    teaching support vector machines and all these things. I learned that, but when
    I graduated, it turned out that SVMs aren’t that common [chuckles] to my surprise.
    And then I was like, “Okay, now I need to learn about other methods that are more
    common, like neural networks.” Of course, the education didn't stop there.
  sec: 3394
  time: '56:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I attended the course with my professor, Dr. Lessmann. He works at the
    Institute of Informatics at Humboldt University. And what was really nice was
    that he gave us a very good overview of all the different methods and already
    included neural networks there. I think one of his courses that he did during
    COVID, is now also on YouTube. That is also a good starting point, if you want
    to get started with NLP, for example – he has a couple of lectures on NLP, which
    are pretty nice – for a beginner. [chuckles]

  time: '57:13'
  who: Verena
- line: Did we cover everything we wanted?
  sec: 3468
  time: '57:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 3472
  time: '57:52'
  who: Verena
- header: Verena’s resource recommendations
- line: Okay. Well, maybe one last question before we finish, “Is there any book or
    other resource that you can recommend to our listeners?”
  sec: 3473
  time: '57:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. So, books – there are actually two. The one that I recently read is Entrepreneurial
    Revolution by Daniel Priestley. I really enjoyed that one because it's a very
    practical step-by-step guide on what you need to do to become an entrepreneur
    and how to approach getting customers, to finding your offerings and all this.
    So I really liked that one.
  sec: 3482
  time: '58:02'
  who: Verena
- line: And the other one that I recommend is Mindset by Dr. Carol Dweck. Something
    that I read, I think, two years ago. It really changed my view on… Basically,
    now I'm convinced that you can learn anything and everything [chuckles] if you
    are dedicated enough. And I find that very powerful.
  sec: 3482
  time: '58:02'
  who: Verena
- line: Do they only convince you that you can learn everything, or do they also show
    how in this Mindset book?
  sec: 3537
  time: '58:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's more about how to approach it and why it's important to have this
    mindset first. Then, I think, it's also easier to put into practice. Another thing
    that I can recommend, which is a bit more technical – there's one podcast that
    I recently listened to… Unfortunately, it's only in German. But if you speak German,
    it's an interesting explanation of how large language models work. You also don't
    need to have a lot of prior knowledge. It's called [speaks German] – so, basically,
    “How does an artificial intelligence learn how to speak?”
  sec: 3545
  time: '59:05'
  who: Verena
- line: I will use this as practice tomorrow before my German lesson. Let's see how
    much I will understand.
  sec: 3585
  time: '59:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, actually there’s a lot of German and English, because the guest who
    is being interviewed is German, but he moved to the US many many years ago. So
    it seems like for him speaking English is also easier for him than speaking German.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 3593
  time: '59:53'
  who: Verena
- line: Also if you work in an English-speaking environment, then many terms (machine
    learning terms) usually come up in English.
  sec: 3609
  time: '1:00:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, true. I also find it easier to speak in English, at least for machine-learning-related
    topics.
  sec: 3620
  time: '1:00:20'
  who: Verena
- line: Exactly. For me, it would be difficult to speak about machine learning in
    Russian.
  sec: 3625
  time: '1:00:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Also, when I speak about it in German, I have this tendency to use a
    lot of English words as well. [chuckles]
  sec: 3632
  time: '1:00:32'
  who: Verena
- line: Exactly. Okay. Thanks a lot for joining us today, for sharing your experience
    and telling us about things you plan to work on and things you worked on. That
    was really great. Thanks! And thanks, everyone, for joining us today, too.
  sec: 3639

  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you! Yeah, if you have any further questions, you can find me on LinkedIn.
    Just reach out there.

    agrees, chuckles] Okay, well – bye everyone! Bye Verena!
