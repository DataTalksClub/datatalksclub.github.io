- header: Large Hadron Collider and Mentorship
- line: This week, we’ll talk about your career. Specifically, your transition from
    working as a physicist at the Large Hadron Collider to working with ML. We have
    a special guest today, Anastasia, who is a particle physicist turned data scientist.
    She has experience conducting experiments at the Large Hadron Collider and later
    at Blue Yonder, where she developed AI solutions for global supply chains. She
    also led NLP and search efforts at Kaufland, a major e-commerce chain in Germany.
    Anastasia is also an AI/ML mentor and is passionate about developing the next
    generation of data science talent in Germany. Welcome to our show, Anastasia!

  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you, Alexey. And thank you to your team for preparing this podcast today.
    I'm really honored to be here. I’ve followed your podcast for quite a few years
    now, and it’s always been a pleasure to watch your discussions with guests. I’m
    happy to be one of them today.

  who: Anastasia
- line: And finally, I want to join you in thanking Johanna for preparing the questions
    for today’s interview. So, thanks to Johanna for her help. Let’s start with your
    background. We’ll dive into the details of your experience later, but could you
    briefly outline your career path so far? I think I already touched on that in
    the intro, but maybe you could give us a short overview of your journey.
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Alexey
- header: Career overview and transition from physics to data science
- line: Sure. You’ve already mentioned the major steps in my career. I usually describe
    myself as a “mover.” I’ve moved quite a lot — both personally and professionally.
    First, I moved from Russia to Germany, and within Germany, I’ve moved a few times
    as well. Professionally, I’ve also switched between multiple research experiments.
    The last one was at the Large Hadron Collider, which was the largest of them all.
    Before that, I worked on several smaller projects.
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Anastasia
- line: When I decided to transition to industry, I was fortunate enough to gain experience
    in different sectors, applying my knowledge in a variety of ways. This helped
    me grow in my career and also gave me a broader perspective. Moving into industry
    made me realize where my strengths lie, and it’s been fulfilling to help others
    who might be uncertain about making a similar transition. I’ve mentored many people
    and helped them gain more confidence about moving forward in their own careers.
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Which part of Russia are you from?
  sec: 239
  time: '3:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m from Siberia.
  sec: 242
  time: '4:02'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Where in Siberia?
  sec: 246
  time: '4:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m from Novokuznetsk.
  sec: 257
  time: '4:17'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Ah, I see. My knowledge of Siberia is limited. I’m from the Far East, so we’re
    kind of from opposite ends of Russia, I guess.
  sec: 259
  time: '4:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Where are you from?
  sec: 261
  time: '4:21'
  who: Anastasia
- line: I’m from near Khabarovsk.
  sec: 263
  time: '4:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Ah, okay! When I lived in Siberia, I always wanted to go west, to places like
    St. Petersburg and Moscow. But I ended up moving directly to Germany. I never
    lived in those larger cities in Russia. I did live in Novokuznetsk for a while,
    which is a well-known city, especially in research, because of its research center.
  sec: 266
  time: '4:26'
  who: Anastasia
- line: The university there is quite well-known. And where in Germany are you based
    now?
  sec: 318
  time: '5:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m currently based in Hamburg. I really love the city — it was love at first
    sight, so to speak.
  sec: 323
  time: '5:23'
  who: Anastasia
- line: It’s an amazing city. I was there for three days as a tourist, but it really
    impressed me. It’s so different from Berlin, though.
  sec: 330
  time: '5:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it is. Hamburg has a few places that resemble Berlin, but it’s definitely
    its own unique vibe.
  sec: 336
  time: '5:36'
  who: Anastasia
- line: I think I’ve been to one of those places. The buildings look similar, with
    a lot of graffiti and a kind of gritty feel.
  sec: 345
  time: '5:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I love Berlin too. I’d say it’s my second favorite city in Germany, after
    Hamburg, of course.
  sec: 356
  time: '5:56'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Of course!
  sec: 362
  time: '6:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: We looked at your profile, and Johanna did a great job with that. You have
    such an extensive background. But let’s start with the Large Hadron Collider.
    You’ve participated in very large experiments with hundreds or even thousands
    of people. Could you share more about that experience? What did you do there,
    and why were so many people needed for these experiments? Also, I’ve always wondered
    — what exactly does the Large Hadron Collider do?
  sec: 362
  time: '6:02'
  who: Alexey
- header: Working at the Large Hadron Collider
- line: That’s a great question! I’ll try to keep it simple. The Large Hadron Collider
    is part of particle physics, which is essentially about exploring the universe.
    The basic idea is similar to what you did as a child when you wanted to understand
    something — you break it apart and see what’s inside. In particle physics, we
    break things down to smaller components, like protons and neutrons.
  sec: 422
  time: '7:02'
  who: Anastasia
- line: At the LHC, we accelerate particles to extremely high speeds and then collide
    them. This process allows us to observe new particles or phenomena that were not
    visible before. The collider uses powerful magnets to focus the beams of particles
    and ensure they collide with precision. We use massive detectors to capture the
    results of these collisions. These detectors are like giant cameras, but far more
    advanced. They record data that we analyze to understand the particles created
    in the collisions.
  sec: 422
  time: '7:02'
  who: Anastasia
- header: How particles collide and the role of detectors
- line: The particles are so tiny — how do you ensure they actually collide?
  sec: 559
  time: '9:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Great question! The key is using electromagnetic laws to focus the particles
    with the help of strong magnets. These are some of the strongest magnets on Earth.
    And to measure the outcomes of these collisions, we use detectors that take thousands
    of pictures. In the past, these pictures were analyzed manually, but now it’s
    mostly automated. We collect and store massive amounts of data from these collisions
    — billions of events occur within minutes. Of course, many of them are not particularly
    interesting, but the ones that are can provide breakthrough insights.
  sec: 566
  time: '9:26'
  who: Anastasia
- header: Data analysis challenges in particle physics and data science similarities
- line: Yes.
  sec: 663
  time: '11:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'In particle physics, you collect vast amounts of data in a very short time.
    I don’t remember the exact numbers, but you gather a lot of data within a second.
    Of course, you need algorithms and methods to analyze it. Particle physics has
    always been at the forefront of data analysis, especially statistical analysis,
    which we now use in fields like e-commerce. We face the same problem in particle
    physics: dealing with large amounts of data, which we call events, and identifying
    the interesting ones. This is why particle physics is very similar to data science,
    perhaps even more so than some other fields.'
  sec: 665
  time: '11:05'
  who: Anastasia
- line: However, when I transitioned to industry, I had difficulty explaining this.
    Many people think of particle physics as working with “funny liquids,” which is
    far from true.
  sec: 665
  time: '11:05'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Right, with the cameras and particles colliding, there are billions of events.
    Most are not interesting, so you have to identify the significant ones and analyze
    them.
  sec: 729
  time: '12:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 752
  time: '12:32'
  who: Anastasia
- line: I was curious — why do you need so many people for these large-scale experiments?
    In my previous company, there were a couple of thousand employees, with a few
    hundred in the IT department and only about 20-30 data scientists. But for experiments
    with 500 to 2,500 people, how is the work distributed? What kind of work do all
    these people do?
  sec: 760
  time: '12:40'
  who: Alexey
- header: Team structure at the Large Hadron Collider
- line: If we had more resources, we would definitely hire more people because there’s
    always a lot of work. Not everyone working at the LHC is involved in data science.
    Many are focused on unique aspects of the project, such as hardware. These detectors
    and technologies are often one-of-a-kind, so you need specialized expertise to
    maintain and improve them. There’s also a lot of work related to the radiation
    and the conditions under which we operate.
  sec: 812
  time: '13:32'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Some teams are responsible for maintenance and operations, while others handle
    analysis. But there’s also service work to keep the detectors operational. You
    could think of it as a team effort where you need to maintain and improve the
    hardware and systems. The detectors are like a large camera made up of several
    systems with different principles that need to be aligned. It’s a huge amount
    of work, and that’s why you need thousands of people. Many are learning on the
    job, too, as students often join the project for practical experience.
  sec: 812
  time: '13:32'
  who: Anastasia
- line: That makes sense. Just like in my previous company, where many people worked
    in operations, you need people to maintain the hardware. Similarly, at the LHC,
    the large team is responsible for hardware and operational work, in addition to
    analytics.
  sec: 960
  time: '16:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sorry to interrupt, but you’re right. Typically, data analysis isn’t the only
    task. You also work on the next generation of detectors and their maintenance.
    Most physicists work across both areas — working on analysis as well as on improving
    the detectors. We even have theoreticians who, while not officially part of the
    collaboration, think about new theories. As for data analysis, there are various
    ways to approach the same data because there are many theories trying to explain
    what we don’t yet understand. You need a dedicated team to understand both the
    theory and how the detector works.
  sec: 993
  time: '16:33'
  who: Anastasia
- line: So, what about the idea that the Large Hadron Collider could create a black
    hole and destroy the universe?
  sec: 1057
  time: '17:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s a misunderstanding. There’s a theory suggesting that it could create
    black holes, but they would be very tiny and disappear almost immediately. The
    reason for building the LHC was, on one hand, to look for the Higgs boson, which
    you may have heard about — it was discovered about 10 years ago. The second reason
    was to investigate dark matter and dark energy, substances we don’t fully understand.
    While we have evidence of their existence, we don’t know what they are. We hoped
    that the LHC’s energy would be sufficient to create particles that could help
    us understand dark matter, but so far, that hasn’t happened.
  sec: 1066
  time: '17:46'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Although the scale of the project is enormous and expensive, it provides a
    unique laboratory for such experiments. There’s an ongoing debate about whether
    it’s worth continuing to invest in experiments like these. There are other colliders
    in the world, including one in Germany near Darmstadt, where you can visit the
    construction site. About 500 people are working there, but it’s not exactly the
    same as the LHC — it’s another experiment focused on particle acceleration.
  sec: 1066
  time: '17:46'
  who: Anastasia
- line: I visited a planetarium in Germany about a year ago, where they discussed
    dark matter. They also showed a map of various Hadron colliders around the world,
    and I was curious about how they connected dark matter to the LHC. Now it makes
    more sense.
  sec: 1174
  time: '19:34'
  who: Alexey
- header: Explaining the connection between particle physics and data science
- line: Yes, you essentially can. You build a theory to explain something, and then
    you try to prove it with experiments in the lab. These are controlled experiments
    to some degree. It’s not fully controlled, but it's the best way to manage it
    with the tools we have available.
  sec: 1205
  time: '20:05'
  who: Anastasia
- line: One of the things you mentioned is that particle physics is much closer to
    data science than most people imagine. But you also faced challenges explaining
    this, because the common image of a scientist is someone working with liquids
    and complex machinery. How did you convince people that what you were doing was
    data science? How did you explain that you were following best software engineering
    practices to avoid creating chaos and potentially destroying the universe?
  sec: 1227
  time: '20:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: It took me some time to realize I needed to explain this. When you're in a
    specific field, you don’t realize that others have no idea how it works. You're
    surrounded by people who understand it, and it doesn't occur to you that you need
    to explain it clearly to outsiders. Most of the time, when I discussed my work,
    the conversation was about what we were doing and why we needed so many people.
    But when I entered the job market, I had to adjust my story. I realized that I
    had to understand what companies were looking for and how to connect my experience
    to that. This was a difficult lesson to learn.
  sec: 1264
  time: '21:04'
  who: Anastasia
- line: One of the key aspects of my work was software development. To handle large
    projects, you need a lot of software. I was fortunate to be exposed to the best
    software practices early on because that’s the only way to manage such large-scale
    projects with thousands of people involved. It wasn’t a monolithic structure,
    but there were large, complex systems for data collection, storage, and processing.
    When I moved to industry, I realized that many of the tools we used, like version
    control, CI/CD, and GitHub, were the same practices used in the tech world. This
    was something I didn’t fully understand at first, but when I started applying
    it in industry, I saw how these practices helped us manage large systems and avoid
    errors.
  sec: 1264
  time: '21:04'
  who: Anastasia
- header: Software engineering practices in particle physics
- line: You already knew about GitHub and CI/CD, right?
  sec: 1401
  time: '23:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, although I didn’t always know the terminology. I understood the concepts,
    but the terms like version control and CI/CD were new to me. I remember the debates
    we had at the LHC about whether to adopt a version control system. People were
    resistant at first, but once we implemented it, I saw how much easier it made
    our work. It saved us a lot of headaches, and it was implemented during my final
    years there.
  sec: 1409
  time: '23:29'
  who: Anastasia
- line: So, you understood the concepts, even if you didn't know the terms at first.
    I imagine you also had to learn the language of data science when transitioning
    into that field, right?
  sec: 1471
  time: '24:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. I had to translate the language of physics into a more accessible
    form. In physics, machine learning concepts were often referred to as multivariate
    analysis. But when I mentioned this term, no one understood what I was talking
    about. The language barrier was something I had to overcome, and it was tricky
    at first.
  sec: 1511
  time: '25:11'
  who: Anastasia
- line: I can imagine that you must have had a hard time in interviews. You’d explain
    your work on dark matter, the Higgs boson, and particle collisions, and while
    it’s impressive, people might have wondered, "What does this have to do with our
    work?"
  sec: 1552
  time: '25:52'
  who: Alexey
- header: Challenges during interviews for data science roles
- line: Yes, absolutely. I failed a couple of interviews. I didn’t realize how serious
    it was, and that these weren’t just casual conversations — they were about specific
    jobs in particular companies, where they were looking for particular experience.
    At the time, data science was not as widely understood, and there weren’t many
    candidates, so companies were hiring without fully understanding the field themselves.
    Many of the interviews I had were for roles where I would have been the first
    data scientist at the company, and they weren’t sure what they needed. I was lucky
    to be in a market where data science was just emerging, but I didn’t fully understand
    what was expected of me.
  sec: 1571
  time: '26:11'
  who: Anastasia
- line: So you had offers to join companies as the only data scientist, but you decided
    not to accept them?
  sec: 1649
  time: '27:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I didn’t have offers. I was invited to interviews, but they quickly realized
    I didn’t have the exact skills they were looking for. I wasn’t selected in the
    end.
  sec: 1656
  time: '27:36'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Then you joined Blue Yonder, which is a software vendor for the supply chain
    industry. What did they do?
  sec: 1673
  time: '27:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, Blue Yonder is a software vendor for supply chain solutions. It started
    as a small startup in Germany, founded by a physics professor. Even though there
    aren’t many physicists there anymore, they still understand the work I did. This
    helped a lot because they had the business understanding and also the technical
    knowledge. Before I joined, the company was acquired by a large US software vendor,
    and the company was so impressed by the work Blue Yonder had done that they decided
    to rebrand themselves under the Blue Yonder name. It was a great place to work,
    and looking back, I’m glad I ended up there.
  sec: 1680
  time: '28:00'
  who: Anastasia
- line: You're not at Blue Yonder anymore, right?
  sec: 1758
  time: '29:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I left over a year ago.
  sec: 1759
  time: '29:19'
  who: Anastasia
- line: What are you doing now?
  sec: 1763
  time: '29:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now, I’m focused mainly on mentoring.
  sec: 1765
  time: '29:25'
  who: Anastasia
- header: Mentoring and offering advice to job seekers
- line: That’s great! Tell us more about your mentoring work. I see there's a related
    question that might connect with what you’re doing now. Someone asked how to convince
    German companies in this field, as they’ve had multiple interviews but keep getting
    rejected without feedback. What advice would you give?
  sec: 1770
  time: '29:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s a common challenge. A lot of German companies don’t provide feedback
    when they reject candidates, which can make it difficult for job seekers to improve.
    In cases like this, I’d recommend focusing on understanding the specific skills
    each company is looking for and tailoring your story to show how your background
    fits those needs. It’s also helpful to seek out mentors or industry professionals
    who can provide guidance.
  sec: 1793
  time: '29:53'
  who: Anastasia
- line: That's a great question. In general, people in Germany and Europe tend to
    be very cautious when giving feedback because they're afraid you might sue them,
    which is not very typical. In many cases, people assume they could go to court
    if they are unhappy with something. Still, it's rare to receive direct feedback.
    The best approach is to build a good relationship with the hiring manager. You
    can ask them for a quick call and honestly inquire about areas where you could
    improve. If you've gone through multiple interview stages, they may be able to
    give you specific feedback.
  sec: 1845
  time: '30:45'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Often, the reason for not being selected has nothing to do with the candidate
    but rather that another person is considered a better fit. It’s more about the
    team composition rather than the individual candidate. So, my advice is to reach
    out to the person you’ve been in contact with and ask for a short follow-up. However,
    don’t expect too much — sometimes a company might decide to promote someone internally
    or even stop the hiring process altogether. Unfortunately, it's common to get
    a standard rejection without much detail.
  sec: 1845
  time: '30:45'
  who: Anastasia
- line: I remember from my experience working at multiple companies, some of which
    were German, that when you don’t get feedback, it might be because of a cultural
    fit issue. Companies often avoid giving specific reasons for rejecting a candidate,
    especially when it comes to cultural fit. This is a tricky topic, as discussing
    it could lead to legal complications. To stay on the safe side, companies tend
    to avoid directly mentioning it and instead just say, "Sorry, it didn’t work out."
    This often happens even in one-on-one conversations, and HR is reluctant to delve
    into it.
  sec: 1956
  time: '32:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, when it comes to cultural fit, it’s a very sensitive issue. Companies
    will never phrase it directly that way. Instead, they focus on hard skills and
    avoid mentioning behavioral or cultural fit.
  sec: 2021
  time: '33:41'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Right, like if you didn’t pass a coding challenge, that’s a more objective
    reason.
  sec: 2037
  time: '33:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. It can also help to discuss your interview experience with someone
    else who wasn’t involved. Often, just talking through the interview with a mentor
    or friend can reveal which part of the interview went wrong. I do this with my
    mentees — a post-interview feedback session where we analyze how things went.
    Even if the candidate’s answers were technically fine, there might have been hesitation
    or uncertainty in delivery that affected the outcome.
  sec: 2043
  time: '34:03'
  who: Anastasia
- line: This kind of feedback is valuable, not just in mock sessions for preparation,
    but also afterward. It’s helpful to talk to someone with experience in the field
    who can give you insight into whether your behavior was acceptable or not. As
    for transitions in career, you don’t always realize that things are done differently
    in different countries, industries, or companies. Having someone close to the
    process can be very helpful.
  sec: 2043
  time: '34:03'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Regarding the behavioral part of interviews, many candidates underestimate
    it. It’s often the most important aspect, not just whether you solved the coding
    challenge. How you present yourself, how you react to specific situations — those
    are key. If you’re not prepared for this part of the interview, you might not
    pass.
  sec: 2043
  time: '34:03'
  who: Anastasia
- line: This is especially true for people from Eastern Europe. In places like Russia,
    there’s often a stronger focus on hard skills. For instance, I thought if I knew
    Java well, I’d definitely get hired, but then companies started asking me questions
    like, “Tell us about a time when you helped a colleague.” That kind of thing was
    unexpected for me.
  sec: 2154
  time: '35:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s true. But I wouldn’t say this is exclusive to Western Europe. I work
    with people from all over the world, and I see similar experiences.
  sec: 2191
  time: '36:31'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Yes, because in university, we mostly focus on solving math and programming
    problems. At least, that was my experience studying computer science — we put
    too much emphasis on hard skills and overlook teamwork and soft skills.
  sec: 2204
  time: '36:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely, I agree. But I think it's similar in German universities too.
    The problem is that when you’re at the start of your career, you often don’t realize
    the importance of soft skills. I can say this from my own experience as well.
    Soft skills are actually the most important to move forward in your career. It
    doesn’t matter how good you are at Java or Python if you can’t collaborate with
    a team and resolve issues that come up.
  sec: 2226
  time: '37:06'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Mhm. What would you suggest as a good way to prepare for this?
  sec: 2267
  time: '37:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: First of all, be aware that the behavioral part of an interview is just as
    important as the technical part. Don’t underestimate it. It requires specific
    preparation. What usually helps is reviewing common questions — you can easily
    find lists online or ask ChatGPT to help you generate some questions. Practice
    answering them, and prepare a few stories you can tell. You don’t need to come
    up with creative stories for every question, just a few solid ones that highlight
    your skills and experiences.

    time. You can refresh your memory by reviewing your notes before interviews. Also,
    think about which soft skills the company would value most — whether it’s teamwork,
    proactivity, or being supportive.
  sec: 2273
  time: '37:53'
  who: Anastasia
- line: That’s great advice. For me personally, what helped was looking up Amazon’s
    leadership principles and practicing interview questions based on them. Amazon
    has a very clear set of leadership principles, and they use these to assess if
    someone fits into their culture. Many other companies, especially in tech and
    e-commerce, have similar frameworks. Looking up questions related to these principles
    helped me prepare for interviews at other companies as well. There’s also a book
    called "Groin in Rio" (or something similar).

  sec: 2403
  time: '40:03'
  who: Anastasia
- line: The interview. Yeah, so there’s a clock on the cover of Cracking the Coding
    Interview. There's a chapter on behavioral interviews that gives you a framework
    — a table where you can organize your stories. They also suggest using the STAR
    format to answer questions.
  sec: 2408
  time: '40:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: The STAR format is actually quite controversial. Many people say you can't
    frame your technical experience using STAR, but I disagree. I think having a framework
    is better than nothing, and it helps structure your thoughts. It’s especially
    useful when you’re answering a question you're not prepared for, which happens
    quite often. Knowing how to structure your response is valuable. The STAR method
    stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Mentally, you move through each
    of these steps, and it’s really helpful. Even if you’ve never told a particular
    story before, structuring it well makes it understandable. It’s a fantastic approach
    because it helps the listener follow your thought process clearly. STAR is probably
    the most well-known framework, but there are others too.
  sec: 2433
  time: '40:33'
  who: Anastasia
- line: And you mentioned that you’re currently focused on mentoring, right? How did
    you decide to focus on mentoring? It must have been a difficult decision to switch
    from working to focusing completely on this, right? I know that feeling — when
    I was working and doing DataTalks.Club, I eventually decided to focus fully on
    the podcast, which felt like a leap of faith. It’s scary, right? How did it happen
    for you?
  sec: 2486
  time: '41:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: To be fair, it wasn’t like I imagined myself becoming a mentor for the rest
    of my life. It just felt like the right moment. Several factors came together,
    pushing me in this direction. I was happy to pursue it, especially since my last
    job didn’t work out, and mentoring gave me a sense of purpose. It also helped
    me align with something that fit me better. However, it’s a hard job. I really
    enjoy mentoring and believe I’m good at it. Many people I’ve worked with are happy,
    and we’ve worked together for months. But it’s a tough role. On one hand, you
    work with highly motivated and talented people, which, as a leader, is an ideal
    situation. Every leader dreams of working with people who are eager to grow and
    follow your guidance. But on the other hand, they are constantly challenging themselves
    and you. You always feel the pressure to do more, think deeper, and prepare better.
    It’s a continuous learning process. In our field, it’s common to constantly stretch
    yourself, which can be stressful. As a mentor, you need to find a balance and
    recognize when you’ve learned enough to help others effectively without burning
    yourself out.
  sec: 2525
  time: '42:05'
  who: Anastasia
- line: How did you start mentoring?
  sec: 2647
  time: '44:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: It happened somewhat by accident. After moving into the industry, a few people
    approached me and asked for help because they were struggling. I remembered my
    own struggles, so I was happy to help. Over time, when people at my company, Blue
    Yonder, formally asked if I could be their mentor, I realized there was a term
    for this. I started thinking about it more seriously. And then, when I tried to
    find a mentor myself, I noticed that being advanced in your career doesn’t automatically
    make someone a good mentor. A mentor has to actively want to help, and not everyone
    is suited for the role, even if they agree to it. This made me reflect on what
    mentoring actually is and how it should work.
  sec: 2650
  time: '44:10'
  who: Anastasia
- line: So, what is mentoring?
  sec: 2711
  time: '45:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Good question. Mentoring is about making other people's lives easier. It’s
    about helping them achieve their goals by sharing knowledge and experience.
  sec: 2713
  time: '45:13'
  who: Anastasia
- line: It seems like mentoring is a process. It’s not just meeting for a quick coffee,
    right? It’s a more ongoing, regular commitment.
  sec: 2720
  time: '45:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. While it’s possible to meet someone just once to help with a particular
    question, I wouldn’t call that mentoring. Mentoring usually involves a process,
    and the mentor needs to understand the goal of that process. The goal could be
    finding a job, getting a promotion, transitioning from academia to industry, or
    even moving to a new country. Knowing the goal helps you find the right mentor.
    For example, if you want to find a job in Germany but have never worked there
    before, you need a mentor who knows the German job market and can guide you through
    it. Mentoring involves sharing your knowledge, but you also need to stay updated,
    especially if you’re mentoring someone in a different context from your own experience.
    It’s important to keep learning, stay strategic, and constantly reflect on your
    motivations as a mentor. Coming from physics, I think time and energy are the
    most valuable resources in life. As a mentor, I aim to save others time and energy
    by guiding them toward their goals.
  sec: 2742
  time: '45:42'
  who: Anastasia
- line: You mentioned earlier that you didn’t initially decide to become a mentor,
    but people asked you for mentorship. Was it a similar process for you in the beginning?
  sec: 2873
  time: '47:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. I’ve always been curious and have spent a lot of my free time
    learning — taking courses, reading books, and attending events. I accumulated
    a lot of knowledge but couldn’t use it at my job, especially at Blue Yonder, where
    the data science use cases were limited. Mentoring became a way for me to share
    this knowledge and connect with others. I also found some mentors in areas I wasn’t
    familiar with, like computer vision, where I’m learning alongside them. It’s a
    way to explore new fields together.
  sec: 2899
  time: '48:19'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Let’s say I have a problem, like I want to find a job or get a promotion.
    I come across someone who has already made a similar transition — maybe from Russia
    to Germany, or from academia to industry — and I reach out to ask for help. How
    can I make it interesting for that person to respond? Sometimes I get random requests
    on LinkedIn, like “Hey, be my mentor,” without any context, and it’s hard to see
    why I should respond to such a vague request.
  sec: 2965
  time: '49:25'
  who: Alexey
- header: Paid vs unpaid mentorship and finding the right fit
- line: Yes, it’s a really big thing. To be a mentor requires a lot of time and effort,
    right?
  sec: 3032
  time: '50:32'
  who: Anastasia
- line: I don’t know… It’s the first time I see your face on LinkedIn. Wait, sorry
    — how should someone approach you if they really need help?
  sec: 3035
  time: '50:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s a very good question. There are many ways to find a mentor. Some mentors
    are paid, like me, and others are unpaid. There are also communities where you
    can find unpaid mentors. Regardless of whether you're able to pay or not, I suggest
    starting with these communities. You’ll find people who have made the decision
    to dedicate time to mentoring.
  sec: 3052
  time: '50:52'
  who: Anastasia
- line: This decision is crucial. There are people who just start mentoring because
    they realize it’s important to them, but most people you randomly approach online
    may talk with you once out of curiosity. However, it won’t be very helpful, and
    it’ll be a waste of both your time and theirs.
  sec: 3052
  time: '50:52'
  who: Anastasia
- line: 'So, when reaching out, it’s important to have clear goals: why you need help,
    what you''re missing, and why you’re approaching that particular mentor. Even
    for paid mentors, I still choose the people I work with, because I know I can’t
    help everyone. The description of your goals matters even in those cases.'
  sec: 3052
  time: '50:52'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Yes, I agree. When someone sends a concrete message saying, "This is what
    I need help with — how about meeting for lunch next week?" it’s much more effective.
    It shows clear intent and makes it easier for the mentor to help.
  sec: 3147
  time: '52:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely! If you just say, "Hey, be my mentor," the best thing that might
    happen is that people don’t respond. I doubt that approach would get a positive
    reply. It’s much better to be concrete, ask for a manageable amount of time, and
    show you're serious. If you're asking for too much time at the start, it can be
    overwhelming for the mentor, especially if they’re busy.
  sec: 3175
  time: '52:55'
  who: Anastasia
- line: I saw a comment on YouTube about paid mentorship, saying it sounds odd. But
    for me, mentors invest time and energy, so it doesn’t sound strange. What do you
    think?
  sec: 3217
  time: '53:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s a great question. As someone who invests a lot of time in mentoring,
    I can’t imagine doing it for free all the time. Though I do sometimes. I’ve been
    part of unpaid communities before, and I understand there are some downsides to
    that. When you pay for something, you tend to take it more seriously. It’s a commitment.
    You’re investing both time and money, and that makes you more committed.
  sec: 3232
  time: '53:52'
  who: Anastasia
- line: From a mentor's perspective, it helps us maintain quality interactions. Mentorship
    becomes more productive because both sides are invested. Of course, sharing my
    knowledge has also been free at times, like posting on LinkedIn. But when I’m
    mentoring one-on-one, it’s more personalized, and it requires a lot of energy.
    It’s absolutely worth it, but if paid mentorship isn’t for you, that’s fine too.
    There are many free mentoring options, especially in Germany, where people are
    sometimes hesitant to charge due to tax concerns.
  sec: 3232
  time: '53:52'
  who: Anastasia
- line: I agree. When you were at Blue Yonder, people approached you to be their mentor.
    I’ve had a similar experience in my previous company. It’s interesting because
    it adds more work but without a salary increase. It’s unpaid labor in a sense,
    but the experience is valuable. Also, it’s good for career progression, for example,
    moving from an analyst to a data scientist position. There are already frameworks
    in HR departments for that.
  sec: 3344
  time: '55:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Within a company, being a mentor can bring additional benefits. It
    might not be paid, but it can be good for your promotion or expanding your network.
    You often work with people outside your immediate team or department, which is
    valuable. Mentorship within a company has always existed, and it still adds value
    even if it's not officially compensated. If you’re looking for an external mentor,
    it's important to understand their motivation for mentoring. You’ll want to know
    how far they can help you based on that motivation.
  sec: 3390
  time: '56:30'
  who: Anastasia
- line: Right. I actually used my mentorship experience to help with my promotion.
  sec: 3450
  time: '57:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: I didn’t do that back then, but at one point, I realized that at Blue Yonder,
    I couldn’t go as far or as fast as I wanted in terms of leadership positions.
    I wanted to explore leadership outside of the company, which is why I left. Having
    the mentor experience helped me because even though I didn’t have a formal title
    like "manager," I had led projects and teams informally. When I discussed my mentorship
    experience, it became clear that it was relevant for leadership positions in data
    science, even without formal leadership titles. It gave me an edge in interviews
    with companies that valued those skills.
