description: 'Master analytics engineering with dbt and data modeling: learn pipelines, testing, Snowflake basics and a clear career roadmap to advance your data career.'
intro: How do you become an effective analytics engineer and what skills, tools, and career steps matter most? In this episode, Victoria Perez Mola—born in Argentina, trained as a Systems Engineer and now an Analytics Engineer at Tier in Berlin—walks us through her move from ERP and finance reporting into analytics engineering. We cover daily responsibilities like data modeling, pipelines, data quality and Looker; the DBT workflow (SQL transformations, version control, tests, DAG); and a practical analytics toolstack including DBT, Snowflake, Adlib ETL and Looker. Victoria contrasts analytics engineer, data analyst and data engineer roles, explains role origins, and outlines typical job expectations such as pipeline ownership, auditing and dashboarding. She digs into core skills—SQL, dimensional modeling, Snowflake—strategies for handling bad data and schema changes with DBT macros and tests, and team structures from platform teams to embedded roles. Listen for a clear career roadmap, concrete learning resources (DBT tutorials and an 'Analytics readings' Notion list), and indicators of role fit if you enjoy modeling, data quality and engineering best practices

- header: 'Guest Introduction: Victoria Perez Mola overview'
- line: This week, we'll talk about a new role in the data team. This role is the
    analytics engineer. We have a special guest today, Victoria. Victoria works as
    an analytics engineer. She has a background in system engineering and she works
    as an analytics engineer at Tier in Berlin. Overall, she has over five years of
    experience working with ERP systems – reporting and databases. She's very passionate
    about using technology and she wants to help people to make their daily tasks
    easier. But in her free time, she likes to encourage people to enter the IT world
    by volunteering, teaching and mentoring. Also, Victoria is one of the first people
    who joined DataTalks.club – one of the first 10 or 20. Welcome, Victoria!
  sec: 108
  time: '1:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you for having me.
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Victoria
- header: 'Career Journey: Systems engineering, ERP & finance reporting'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of what analytics engineering is, let’s start
    with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 165
  time: '2:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: As you said, I started as a systems engineer back in Argentina. That’s computer
    science. I knew a lot about accounting because my parents are accountants and
    I worked with them for several years. I like accounting as well, it felt super
    natural to me to start working with ERP systems. I was helping accountants use
    ERP – to use technology to calculate payroll and taxes. Then from there, I came
    to Berlin in 2018. I also continued working in a similar role – helping in the
    finance team, defining and making reports, connecting the European systems with
    other systems and automating processes. Eventually, I wanted to move from the
    European world and that's how I ended up in the analytics engineer role. I've
    been here now for seven months as an analytics engineer and I’m enjoying it a
    lot.
  sec: 175
  time: '2:55'
  who: Victoria
- header: 'Daily Responsibilities: Data modeling, pipelines, data quality, Looker'
- line: What do you do as an analytics engineer? What kind of responsibilities do
    you have? What does your typical day look like?
  sec: 245
  time: '4:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: I do a lot of data modeling. I also work a lot around the data quality and
    data availability. Things that I could be doing on a day-to-day basis are building
    new pipelines, making that data available, building models. Also I clean that
    data so it's available for data analysts and the data scientists by exposing that
    data to Looker. I also work on it if something goes wrong. If something fails,
    then I have to chime in and check why the data is not available or why the data
    is not clean.
  sec: 254
  time: '4:14'
  who: Victoria
- line: You said modeling – you probably mean data modeling, right?
  sec: 300
  time: '5:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, data modeling.
  sec: 303
  time: '5:03'
  who: Victoria
- line: That would mean creating diagrams, how the data looks like, what are the entities
    in the data, right?
  sec: 305
  time: '5:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but it’s more about writing that. More writing the SQL I mean. Building
    the models around the data, creating the tables, or views, and writing the queries
    behind it to model the data so that the data can be used for analysis.
  sec: 315
  time: '5:15'
  who: Victoria
- line: You mentioned a tool called Looker, which is a tool for building dashboards,
    right? Or what is it?
  sec: 340
  time: '5:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Looker is a BI tool, similar to Tableau. There, you can write queries
    as well. Then you can create dashboards and build reports as well. That would
    be the tool that gets exposed to the end user. The business users are going to
    be consuming the data from Looker. Then the data team uses DBT for doing the whole
    modeling. DBT is a transformation tool. We take the data that comes from the data
    pipelines, from either our backend events, or maybe our external data. Then with
    DBT, we transform that data and we make the models. We do everything we need to
    either clean the data, change it, or maybe calculate something – things like that.
    We try to do everything in DBT.
  sec: 347
  time: '5:47'
  who: Victoria
- header: 'DBT Overview: SQL transformations, version control, tests, DAG'
- line: This “DBT” is a transformation tool you said. What does it do exactly? You
    just write a bunch of SQL queries and put them somewhere?
  sec: 409
  time: '6:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, you write a lot of SQL queries with it. But it has very good things.
    If you think about the software development process that you normally study in
    university and you think about data – they normally don't get along very well.
    DBT brings that to the data team and the data work. You have all these SQL files,
    but you also have YML files, where you would have documentation about the models
    that you're writing about. Everything is in a GitHub repository, so you have version
    control as well. It is sometimes very hard, at least in my experience, to introduce
    something like version control in data. But it's also something that is extremely
    useful to have. You can also write tests in DBT about your data. You can write
    your own or you can also use normal, unique, non-null kinds of tests. The nice
    thing about it is that you don't really have to write the DDL. So you wouldn't
    have to write CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, DROP TABLE – you just write a SELECT
    and it does the whole thing for you. It compiles the code afterwards.
  sec: 419
  time: '6:59'
  who: Victoria
- line: DBT is a tool, as you said, for transforming data – you write a bunch of SQL
    queries and then it takes care of actually creating this table. Is that right?
    You said you don't need to worry about the DDL. Then, you can also do tests with
    this tool, right? Check that the data quality is good. And I guess you can also
    schedule the queries? To run them on a particular day, for example?
  sec: 505
  time: '8:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. It manages the dependencies. It even builds the DAG, and you can see
    how the models connect to each other. Let's say we have a source module and then
    on top of that, you build a dim table. Then you could run from the dim table everything
    that comes before, from the source, and everything that comes afterwards. This
    is very nice. You can easily check dependencies downstream and upstream as well.
    DBT is open source, but they also have a paid part – enterprise I think it’s called
    – which is DBT cloud. There, you can schedule everything. You can set the schedule
    and run your models depending on tags that you could use. For example, if there
    are tables or views or things like that. We have some of them. For example, some
    of the data is refreshing every hour. Some of the data only refreshes during the
    night.
  sec: 539
  time: '8:59'
  who: Victoria
- header: 'Analytics Toolstack: DBT, Snowflake, Adlib ETL, Looker'
- line: You mentioned Looker, which is a tool for end users. You mentioned DBT. Are
    there other tools that you also typically use in your work?
  sec: 604
  time: '10:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I also use a tool a lot called Adlib – for doing the ETL. We mostly do
    ELE because the transformation is done in DBT. We also use Adlib. It's an ETL
    tool to load the data from the S3. We have the data coming into S3 buckets and
    then we use this tool to load this data into Snowflake. So – also Snowflake. We
    used to have Redshift before. Normally, you'd have to use one of these cloud computing
    warehouses. I've also seen other companies that use Python, or at least the folks
    in the analytics engineer role. At least they request for that.
  sec: 615
  time: '10:15'
  who: Victoria
- line: Do you also use them? Or is it just something that others require?
  sec: 665
  time: '11:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: I saw that others do it. I don't. I use a lot of SQL. That's my main language,
    and then Adlib, Snowflake and Looker.
  sec: 669
  time: '11:09'
  who: Victoria
- line: Okay, so Snowflake is there. You have this DBT tool, where you write SQL queries.
    But these queries need to be executed somewhere. And this somewhere is Snowflake,
    right? This is where the queries are running.
  sec: 683
  time: '11:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The queries are running in Snowflake.
  sec: 697
  time: '11:37'
  who: Victoria
- header: 'Transition Story: From BI/ERP work to analytics engineering'
- line: How did you become an analytics engineer? I think you mentioned that you were
    interested in accounting and you were doing all this ERP analysis and working
    with financial data. But then at some point, you decided to become an analytics
    engineer. How did this happen? And what did you need to actually do to transition
    into this role?
  sec: 708
  time: '11:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it was by chance. I wasn’t actively looking for an analytics engineer
    role, and I didn't really know what it was before. But I applied for a normal
    BI position. I don't even remember which position I applied for. Then I did all
    the interviews and I think the last interview was on a Friday. Then on the coming
    Monday, I was told that they were going through a hiring freeze because of the
    Coronavirus. After a few months, the hiring manager reached out to me again and
    said, “Hey, we're opening. We're hiring again. Are you willing to have a chat?”
    Then he told me about this position and it sounded really cool. It sounded like
    something that I wanted to be doing. Some parts are very similar to what I was
    doing before. Before I was also working with data warehousing and all of that.
    I was working more with the ERP data. That's how I ended up here. I even remember
    that at the end of that call, he says, “Okay, so then I'll send you the email
    with the details of the offer. And by the way, the role is called ‘analytics engineer’.
  sec: 734
  time: '12:14'
  who: Victoria
- line: Okay. So you had no idea that this is the role you interviewed for?
  sec: 824
  time: '13:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, basically.
  sec: 706
  time: '11:46'
  who: Victoria
- line: Okay. That's interesting. Do you know how or why the company actually decided
    to have this kind of role?
  sec: 707
  time: '11:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did they come up with the idea of hiring analytics engineers? I know that
    during Corona, they were thinking about how to reshape the team. How were they
    going to grow, make the team grow, and all of that. They were using DBT before
    and the ones that are pushing for the analytics engineers, I would say. So that
    would also make sense that it came from there, but I owe you the answer to that
    one.
  sec: 841
  time: '14:01'
  who: Victoria
- header: 'Role Comparison: Analytics Engineer vs Data Analyst vs Data Engineer'
- line: When I read the job descriptions, the position really looks like a data engineer.
    But on the other hand, there’s this analytics component. So what is the main difference
    between an analytics engineer, a data analyst, and data engineer?
  sec: 874
  time: '14:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: The analytics engineer is supposed to be in the middle between the data engineer
    and the data analyst. The lines are a little bit blurry even in my team and not
    just in different companies. Some of us are regarded to be more in the data engineer
    side and others more in the data analyst side. I think that will vary. But overall,
    the data analysts sometimes have to do a lot of data cleaning/data availability.
    In reality, they have to have a lot of business knowledge as well. They should
    take care of analyzing the data and not cleaning the data, right? Maybe their
    SQL can work and it has a lot of business logic, but it's not the most efficient
    queries. Because they normally come from another type of background, not a computer
    science background. They know good software deployment practices.
  sec: 891
  time: '14:51'
  who: Victoria
- line: In the case of the data engineers, they are way more technical, and maybe
    they lacki more of the business vision to the thing. They do have the software
    engineering practices, but they maybe don't have the domain knowledge. The analytics
    engineer is in between that. They are supposed to help the analyst apply their
    business models, but also work with the data engineers to bring in this business
    knowledge as well.
  who: Victoria
- line: They know both, right? The analytics engineer knows how to be a good analyst,
    and he or she also knows how to be a good data engineer. Right?
  sec: 984
  time: '16:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: They’re in between, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't say that I would be a great data
    analyst, because everyone's different here. I have to know that part, but I wouldn't
    replace any of my data analyst coworkers.
  sec: 998
  time: '16:38'
  who: Victoria
- header: 'Role Origins & Purpose: Spotify, reducing analysts'' cleaning workload'
- line: Six months ago, we had a chat and you told me that you found this new job
    called analytics engineer. I asked you “What is that?” Before that, I had no idea
    that this role existed. But after talking to you, all of a sudden, I started noticing
    it everywhere. I would go to LinkedIn and I would see open positions. I would
    go to some Slack communities and I would see job postings there. Also on the internet,
    I started to see this thing. It looked like it became popular recently – at least
    that’s my impression. Do you know why it happened? Why did it become popular?
    And what is the gap that this role is trying to close?
  sec: 1014
  time: '16:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, there’s definitely an analytics engineer movement starting. I left a
    few links about when people started to talk about this role, what they need, and
    things like that. There's one about Spotify. They talk about this very clearly.
    They were having issues where the analysts were spending too much time cleaning
    the data. Whenever they needed new data, they needed to set up this stream of
    new data. They needed to check the quality and they needed to model the data in
    a way that they could use. Only after that were they able to sit and do the actual
    analysis. Then on the other side, data engineers didn't really want it to get
    more into that part – taking that work out of the data analyst. That’s when Spotify
    said that they will open this position. They said, “Okay, let's just hire a new
    person. We need someone else – someone in between.”
  sec: 1063
  time: '17:43'
  who: Victoria
- line: Are you saying that data analysts spent too much time cleaning data and solving
    quality issues and that data engineers didn't want to take care of it for some
    reason?
  sec: 1132
  time: '18:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, they didn't want to get more involved with modeling this type of data,
    because then they have to understand what the data is for. They just wanted to
    build the infrastructure. Also what Spotify was seeing was that data analysts
    weren’t very good at writing and doing these kinds of things. They weren't writing
    the best code. They started to see that they were hiring more people to do this.
    And then they said, “We need a person to do this as a full time job.” Then they
    opened this position and they invented a title, which wasn’t analytics engineer
    originally. It was something else along the lines of ‘data specialist’. That's
    how they hired their first analytics engineer. The guy that was hired as the first
    Spotify analytics engineer said at the beginning, “Hey, this title that you gave
    me is crap.” Then they maybe found a blog or something else and changed it to
    ‘analytics engineer’.
  sec: 1145
  time: '19:05'
  who: Victoria
- line: Okay, so it started at Spotify, right? And then other companies noticed it
    and also decided to follow?
  sec: 1211
  time: '20:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know. They (Spotify) did it in early 2018, and every blog seems to
    say that the role started over there. I wouldn’t pinpoint that “Yes, it was Spotify.”
    But people started noticing this missing role ‘in between’. One that allows analysts
    to actually analyze data, and for data engineers to actually just care about the
    infrastructure and the pipelines. That’s how someone came up with the analytics
    engineer role.
  sec: 1219
  time: '20:19'
  who: Victoria
- header: 'Job Expectations: Example posting traits (pipelines, auditing, dashboards)'
- line: Yeah, I actually thought that data engineers should take care of data quality.
    But I never thought that they wouldn’t need to have this domain knowledge that
    maybe is difficult to acquire, while analysts have it. Yeah. Before this interview,
    I wanted to check a couple of positions (job postings) for an analytics engineer
    and see what kind of requirements there are. I didn't check Spotify, but I found
    a job posting from Airbnb.
  sec: 1252
  time: '20:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'They have these requirements: the first is “understand data needs by interacting
    with data scientists and data engineers.” Then the second one “Architect and build
    data pipelines with data engineers.” The third one is “Be a data expert and tone
    data quality.” I think we talked already about all these things like data pipelines
    and taking care of data quality. Then the fourth one is “Build and improve data
    tools for auditing, error logging, and so on.” And the fifth one is “Design and
    build dashboards to enable self service.”'
  who: Alexey
- line: Do you think this is an accurate description of the requirements that analytics
    engineers have, in general?
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I would say so. It goes from the pipeline to the BI tool. But since
    it's such a nice position, it's going to change from company to company. For example,
    Spotify also talks about something quite similar. They talk more about being the
    “data owner” and to check on data quality. But in other companies – I've seen
    in Trade Republic — they don't even mention data pipelines. The role seems to
    be more on the business side. So it’s going to lean a little bit more towards
    the data analysts.
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Victoria
- line: So there is a wide spectrum. On one side you have the data analysts, on the
    other side you have the data engineer, and there is a whole spectrum of how you
    can mix the two to arrive at the analytics engineer. You can take 50/50 – I think
    in the case of Airbnb, my impression is that it leans more towards the data engineer,
    because there is a lot of work with data pipelines and data tools. But still they
    have this “design and build dashboards” part, which is more of what analysts would
    typically do. So they have maybe 70% data engineering and 30% data analysts. Then
    you said Trade Republic, is more maybe on the other side of the spectrum. So maybe
    70% analysts and 30% engineers.

    teams are going to need people like analytics engineers, who are going to be more
    technical than others. There's also another link that I put about Nubank. They
    also use DBT. While, Airbnb doesn't seem like they use DBT. Even the tool changes
    from company to company. In Nubank, they even have a comparison of what they expect
    to have in the analytics engineer profile versus the data engineer and the data
    analyst. In the case of the analytics engineer, it goes more towards analytics
    and reporting, data pipelines, data modelling, and the whole data quality and
    data sharing part.

  sec: 1570

  who: Alexey

    is SQL, not surprisingly. The second category of skills is “distributed systems
    for data processing” which is Spark, Presto, Hadoop and Hive. Then they have programming
    – Python, R, Schema design, dimensional data modeling. The last thing, which I
    liked – “an eye for design”.
  who: Alexey
- line: In my opinion, most of these things are technical, maybe apart from the last
    one. I think most of these skills, apart from “an eye for design,” is what I would
    see typically in data engineering positions. I think dimensional data modeling,
    schema design, is also something that data engineers tend to do when designing
    data warehouses maybe, or data lakes, or whatever. To me, they look quite typical
    for data engineers. Is it a typical skill set for an analytics engineer, or?
  who: Alexey
- line: If you want to apply for an analytics engineer role on Tier, and we do have
    a lot of openings, by the way. I wouldn't say you need all of this toi apply.
    You definitely need to know SQL. You need to know data modeling. So things like
    what a dim table is, and what a fact table is. Basically, you need to have read
    Kimball’s data warehouse book. Then I would also expect something for Snowflake,
    so definitely not Spark, Presto, Hadoop, Hive. That looks way more data engineer-focused
    to me. As for programming, Python or R – analytics engineers don't use that at
    the moment. It could be something that eventually we start using. We do have some
    Python scripts, so it's not like I've never seen Python code ever in the last
    seven months that I've been working at Tier. But I wouldn't say I needed it. To
    me, Python seems like something that’s easy to pick up if you know coding already.
    Not so data engineering-focused. But again, Airbnb the analytics engineer role
    definitely looks way more technical.

    what it was in the case of Spotify. For example, Nubank is very similar to what
    we have as well. They use DBT a lot. They've been featured in the DBT blogs and

    more. They're one of the main companies that started the analytics engineer movement,
    for sure. They did this by participating in blogs or talking about the analytics
    engineer role, or by being in conferences talking about analytics engineers. They've
    definitely started everything – it's heavily related to DBT. When you think about

    at our company, OLX, who are more actually data analysts – they do the kind of
    work that analysts do. But in some cases, data scientists are doing the engineering
    work. The other end of the spectrum is ML engineers, who are sometimes also called
    ‘data scientists’. From what I see, when it comes to the analytics engineer role,
    it's very similar. There is an analyst, there is a data engineer, and then you
    have the whole spectrum of things in between, while every company has its own
    interpretation of the role, right?
  sec: 1869

    a more defined data analyst or a data scientist role. As a data analyst, you usually
    only take care of analyzing the data, right? Because then, analytics engineers
    are going to take care of the rest. Same for data scientists. Data scientists

    managers, to the business’ stakeholders. Some of my coworkers have this exposure.
    The analytics engineers have more, but the idea is also that the analyst is going
    to still be doing their work. They're talking to these business stakeholders to
    understand what they need, and then also talk to us. But this doesn't mean that
    the analytics engineers are not going to talk with the business stakeholders,
    it could be that you also need to go directly to the business stakeholder as well.

    come in because of new data coming in. You're probably going to have to talk with
    the backend engineers as well to see how they set up that event, because at the
    end, you're going to have to consume that. Of course you have to get involved
    in this case.
  who: Victoria
- line: Also, one thing about the analytics engineers in a team and how it works.
    In my company, we have the analytics platform, it has the data platform. Then
    we have more – operations, analytics, commercial analytics. And they have a panel
    for the data scientists, and we’re in the platform, and then the data engineers.
    Now we’re on the platform, we are old analytics engineers. But then it went off
    these teams, they are also getting an analytics engineer. So it's getting to be
    decentralized. These analytics engineers are going to be more exposed to these
    business stakeholders, because they're going to be inside the operations analytics
    team. This is also in the links. I left a link on how Nubank is talking about
    how they're doing that. How they're scaling and making it so that these teams
    don't depend on the analytics engineers for the platform. They have their own
    analytics engineers in their teams. This is also a way to collaborate.
  who: Victoria
- line: To summarize and to make sure I understood you correctly. There is a platform
    team, where there are a lot of analytics engineers, and then you have separate
    teams, and each team would have one analytics engineer who would work with the
    rest of the people in the team, right?
  sec: 2160

    to that. We don't have much of an issue there. Of course, we have models that
    rely a lot on that. But in that sense, I would say it's not such a big issue.
    In terms of data quality, that's something that we're still working on a lot.
    I don't think that's something that you ever finish. You never get to a point
    “My data is 100% the best data.” But there's also a lot going on in the company
    note, and a little bit outside of us as well. A lot of this data is coming from
    the backend engineers – the data has to come clean from there as well, right?
    Or it has to be good quality when it comes from there.

    us a lot of control. We can see that code, what it’s doing, what the records are.
    Are they duplicated, or excluding, or transforming? We do a lot of things like
    that. DBT also lets you create what they call macros, which is a UDF similar to
    what I would create in any SQL, Servo, Snowflake or whatever. We can also use
    that sometimes to try and form the name of the cities, for example. We have the
    same names for all the cities in all of our day towers, things like that. And
    there are also tests. We check that the cities are defined. That if a number has
    to be between one to five – it doesn't go beyond that.
  who: Victoria

    is a test. And if some record doesn't pass this test, you get an alert.
  sec: 2333
  time: '38:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: So-so. The test is basically a query. Let's say you define your model. You
    create your model and then you define the columns. Then you define that for this
    column, the test that I'm going to apply is “not null”, for example. Then, at
    the end, when you run the test, it's going to select from this table where this
    field is now. Then if it returns nothing, the test is passed. If it returns something,
    then it's going to give you either a warning or an error. The nice thing about
    DBT is that we can do that before building the models. What we do is check that
    the sources don't have errors. If they do have errors, then the modules that use
    the sources are not going to be built. We do this so that we don't build things
    on wrong data.
  sec: 2344

    make the data available so that the data analysts can do the analysis. And with
    the BI…
  sec: 2453

    data engineer and data analysts, you would have a BI analyst who could do the
    analysis. Then you would have a data warehouse developer, who would actually build
    the data warehouse. Which is probably synonymous to the role of a data engineer
    these days.

    close to the analytics engineer role. If you also care a lot about the data quality,
    I would say, and about good practices, as I said before. For example, with my
    team, we build a lot of guidelines and things like that for everyone. For the
    data analysts and data scientists as well. We write about how to write the code,
    what the good practices around this are, how to take care of the tests, and things
    like Adlib tests, or how to do a proper peer review and all these kinds of things.
    That’s something that we also have in common with the other analytics engineers

    an analytics engineer. Are there such things for analytics engineers? The things
    are annoying, but you have to do them anyway. For example, if I don't clean the

    Also, another not annoying, but not-as-rewarding thing, if I compare it with other
    jobs that I had in the past. Before, I would automate something like a process
    and reports when I was working. When my stakeholders were the accountants, and
    then the month would close, suddenly it was being done in one day thanks to my

    data profiling. There's another one, Monte Carlo – I think they also have data
    profiling. There are other tools as well. Unfortunately DBT doesn't have that.
    At least, I think it doesn't have that yet. But it's also because it's not the
    role of DBT. DBT is going to support you in the workflow. But on documentation,
    which is not the same as data profiling, which helps you to understand the documentation,

    DBT actually has a lot regarding documentation. It could have more, but it has
    a lot already. It has a schema YML associated with every module and every source.

    you can host yourself, or it's part of the DBT cloud. There you can see everything
    and you can filter by the model names, the field names, etc. So it has everything
    like that. It has a very small profiling part, which is the amount of rows that
    the table has, table size, and maybe one more little thing, but it's not super
    detailed. It has the code and it has dependencies. It's very easy to go from there
    and see what else you are going to affect if you touch something.
