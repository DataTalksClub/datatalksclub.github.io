title: "Context: Through Dimitri’s journey and practical segments on job data, client acquisition, pricing, AI tools, and scaling, the episode maps the real-world mechanics of going freelance in data.

Core narrative: The unifying idea is that a sustainable, scalable freelance data career is built by starting with market demand—validate financial targets, specialize around high‑impact problems, productize repeatable analytics offerings, leverage productivity tools (including AI) to deliver efficiently, and adopt deliberate pricing and client‑retention models (projects, subscriptions, or agency paths) so you can reliably land clients, capture value, and grow on your own terms."

description: Master data freelancer tactics, pricing strategies and AI tools to land clients, price services confidently, and boost productivity for higher income
intro: How do you move from employed data pro to a sustainable data freelancer who consistently lands clients, prices services well, and uses AI to boost productivity? In this episode, Dimitri Visnadi — an independent data consultant focused on data strategy who’s worked with Unilever, Ferrero, Heineken and Red Bull, held roles at HP and a Google-partnered firm, and holds a Masters in Business Analytics & Computer Science from UCL — walks through a practical playbook for data freelancers. <br><br> Dimitri covers job-tenure trends and freelancer types, when to sell expertise versus problem-solving, and how to validate freelance viability with financial targets. He explains how to land initial clients through recruiters and LinkedIn, the idea behind a data-freelancer job board, market-driven specialization, and insights on rates, top skills and data management. You’ll hear about scaling choices (lifestyle business vs agency), AI tools for productivity (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor), course and community approaches for branding and marketing, subscription models and client relationship management, high-impact small analyses, pricing strategies (hourly vs packages), and transition planning. <br><br> Listen to get concrete guidance on landing clients, setting prices, structuring offers, and using AI tools to increase productivity as a freelance data consultant

- header: Episode Opening & Dimitri’s Data Journey
- line: Hi everyone, welcome to our event. This event is brought to you by DataTalks.Club,
    a community of people who love data. We have weekly events. If you want to find
    out more, there is a link in the description.
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it’s linked in your document.
  sec: 87
  time: '1:27'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Yes, it is. I think it streamed about a year ago, November 20th, 2023, so
    slightly more.
  sec: 94
  time: '1:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi everyone. I started in 2013 after graduating in business administration.
    I fell in love with data after my first internship. I loved Excel and that was
    my entry into the data world.
  sec: 216
  time: '3:36'
  who: Dimitri
- header: Job Tenure Trends & Freelancer Types
- header: Job Tenure Trends & Freelancer Types
- line: I want to apologize for going off script, but isn’t it fun? You mentioned
    staying one and a half years on average at companies. I had a similar situation
    until I found a company where I stayed much longer. Do you think staying around
    a year to a year and a half is becoming the new norm?
  sec: 341
  time: '5:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends. Some say you need about six to seven months to really start providing
    value because you have to learn the people, the product, and the tools. It takes
    time to become a valuable employee.
  sec: 381
  time: '6:21'
  who: Dimitri
- line: To be frank, switching jobs frequently is one of the best ways to increase
    your salary.
  sec: 430
  time: '7:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, probably. When I switched jobs often, I thought employers might ask how
    long I'd stay with them, which I found embarrassing. I also think this has to
    do with generational mindset shifts.
  sec: 436
  time: '7:16'
  who: Dimitri
- line: You mentioned it takes time to become a valuable employee by learning ropes,
    people, and custom tech. As a freelancer, don’t you also need time to learn these
    before doing your job well? Or does the client prepare everything so you can just
    focus on your work?
  sec: 518
  time: '8:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Yes and no. There are different types of freelancers: those who sell skills
    and those who sell expertise.'
  sec: 562
  time: '9:22'
  who: Dimitri
- header: Expertise vs Problem-Solving in Freelance Work
- header: Expertise vs Problem-Solving in Freelance Work
- line: If you don’t know how to solve a specific problem, can you "fake it till you
    make it," like start solving and researching as you go? Does this apply in freelancing
    too, or is problem-solving itself the expertise you sell?
  sec: 650
  time: '10:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can have projects where you need to figure things out as you go, both
    as an employee and freelancer. It depends on the task to be delivered.
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I’ve been doing some freelancing/contract projects, helping companies create
    courses. My expertise is creating courses, but I don’t always know the specific
    content or technologies to use, so I have to learn them. That’s also fine.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'That’s a good example. Your expertise is how to create courses: defining
    the audience, the transformation you want, the technology used to host the course,
    budgets, and recording setups. You just fill in the content based on the client’s
    information.'
  sec: 758
  time: '12:38'
  who: Dimitri
- line: You said freelancing worked well for you. How did you know it was working
    and you were happier?
  sec: 839
  time: '13:59'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Validating Freelance Viability: Financial Targets'
- header: 'Validating Freelance Viability: Financial Targets'
- line: The most important part is making money. When I started, I had no clients
    but set an 8-month deadline to get enough clients or money to show it was viable.
    If it didn’t work, I had four months to find a job.
  sec: 853
  time: '14:13'
  who: Dimitri
- header: 'Landing Initial Clients: Recruiters & LinkedIn'
- header: 'Landing Initial Clients: Recruiters & LinkedIn'
- line: How exactly did you get your first client? Did recruiters help you find clients?
    Was it easy?
  sec: 968
  time: '16:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Before freelancing, recruiters sometimes contacted me on LinkedIn offering
    freelance projects. That made me realize freelancing was possible.
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Dimitri
- header: Market Trends & Building a Data-Freelancer Job Board
- header: Market Trends & Building a Data-Freelancer Job Board
- line: You’ve been in the industry for a while and seen trends change. A few years
    ago, MLOps was popular, but now it seems less so. The problems remain, but AI
    and new terms are more popular. What is hot in the market now for freelancing?
  sec: 1053
  time: '17:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s tough to say because I mainly feed my own pipeline and am not a market
    research expert. Hot topics are in the news and companies look for those skills
    to some extent.
  sec: 1100
  time: '18:20'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Alexey
  sec: 1232
  time: '20:32'
  who: These umbrella terms are understood by most companies they know a data analyst
    gets insights from data and a data engineer handles infrastructure so these roles
    continue to be in demand.
- line: Do you see many ML engineer roles right now?
  sec: 1232
  time: '20:32'
  who: These umbrella terms are understood by most companies they know a data analyst
    gets insights from data and a data engineer handles infrastructure so these roles
    continue to be in demand.
- line: I see ML engineer roles sometimes, but I haven't looked into it that closely,
    to be honest.
  sec: 1239
  time: '20:39'
  who: Dimitri
- line: So, what is this job board? Is it something you're maintaining?
  sec: 1246
  time: '20:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. For context, a couple of years ago, during my paternity leave, I started
    sharing my journey as a data freelancer and learning how other freelancers find
    jobs. One thing I noticed is most visible projects are posted by recruiting agencies
    on their individual job boards, on sites like LinkedIn, Upwork, and so forth.
  sec: 1255
  time: '20:55'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I decided to crawl these websites and aggregate them all into a single data
    freelancer job board. This helps me and others stay on top of the newest projects.
    Crawling this information also provides details like average project budgets,
    so you can get interesting statistics.
  sec: 1255
  time: '20:55'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I also follow big organizations, like Freelancer Map, that let agencies post
    projects and publish market research studies on freelancing trends. It's always
    interesting when trends they discuss match what I see on my job board. It's growing
    bigger over time.
  sec: 1255
  time: '20:55'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Your job board is specifically about data freelancers, right? You don't include
    DevOps, front-end, or back-end roles?
  sec: 1365
  time: '22:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. I segment the listings mainly by job title. Sometimes filters need
    updating because I crawl much more than just data roles, and occasionally, non-data
    roles like designers appear by mistake, but that's rare. If a new role like LLM
    engineer becomes popular, I add it to the filter so it appears.
  sec: 1372
  time: '22:52'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I try to really focus and segment jobs for data analysts, data engineers,
    data architects, AI specialists, web analysts, and similar roles.
  sec: 1372
  time: '22:52'
  who: Dimitri
- header: Market-Driven Specialization & Starting Paths
- header: Market-Driven Specialization & Starting Paths
- line: Do you think it could be more valuable to start freelancing as a generic software
    engineer, not focusing on data and then transition? Or, since freelancing usually
    means specializing and selling your expertise, is it better to learn data engineering
    first before freelancing?
  sec: 1431
  time: '23:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's hard to say what's the best route. I always suggest looking at the market
    first and working backwards from there.
  sec: 1462
  time: '24:22'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I thought of this because you mentioned throwing out a lot of non-data postings
    when crawling. If there are so many backend and general software roles, maybe
    it makes sense for someone to start freelancing there. What do you think?
  sec: 1469
  time: '24:29'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Job Board Insights: Rates, Top Skills & "Data Management"'
- header: 'Job Board Insights: Rates, Top Skills & "Data Management"'
- line: It really depends on the skills you have. If you're a data analyst, you likely
    won't become a software engineer overnight—it takes time to learn new skills.
    I could pull up numbers on how many software engineering roles get filtered out,
    but not immediately.
  sec: 1508
  time: '25:08'
  who: Dimitri
- line: If you visit the website, there's a "Freelancer Rates" section that shows
    hourly rates by job title and top skills. It gives a sense of distribution and
    most frequent and top-paying skills. Some high-paying skills have lower counts
    because they appear less but have higher rates.
  sec: 1508
  time: '25:08'
  who: Dimitri
- line: The job board is a side project to serve my own needs, as I can't personally
    take on 99% of the projects there. But adding a new source is fast with my system.
    Building the crawler taught me about data engineering, even though my background
    is in business and Excel, and I'm not a great coder. It's also been a learning
    project for me.
  sec: 1508
  time: '25:08'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I see you have a section of top-paying skills. The first is "data management"
    ($120/hour), then "AI development" ($116/hour). What is data management?
  sec: 1672
  time: '27:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a good question. I need to define it better on the site. Usually, data
    management jobs have the words "data" and "management" in the title.
  sec: 1694
  time: '28:14'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Is that like organizing data storage, deciding whether to use S3, MySQL, Hadoop,
    and so on?
  sec: 1709
  time: '28:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: It could be. I need to improve filtering for sure, but often, if a project
    can't be categorized as data analyst or engineer, I check for words like "manager"
    or "lead." Some data management jobs are technical, like database managers, while
    others are more strategic, like data strategy projects or fractional data leads.
    Those get grouped under data manager and can involve team leadership.
  sec: 1720
  time: '28:40'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Now it makes sense why the top-paying skill management roles often command
    higher rates.
  sec: 1782
  time: '29:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Top paying skills typically have the lowest counts since there might
    only be a few high-paying projects pulling up the average. It's not a perfect
    visualization yet, but I wanted to publish what I have rather than wait for perfection.
    People with experience can see the trends and truth in the data, and often suggest
    additional improvements for the visualizations. I add those as I receive feedback.
    The goal is to make it available to everyone.
  sec: 1788
  time: '29:48'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I'm checking your job board now. Do you plan to publish historical data as
    open source, so people can analyze trends?
  sec: 1853
  time: '30:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: No one's asked until now, but maybe I should.
  sec: 1873
  time: '31:13'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That could be really valuable for people and course participants looking for
    interesting datasets. With enough data, it would be easier to answer questions
    on what's trending.
  sec: 1879
  time: '31:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: That sounds like a good idea. Freelance job postings become irrelevant quickly,
    since they're only valid for a couple of weeks. That's why my board only shows
    projects from the last month. I started collecting this in March last year, so
    I'm getting to a full year of data. I’ll think about how to share it and get back
    to you for ideas on structuring and publishing.
  sec: 1912
  time: '31:52'
  who: Dimitri
- header: 'Lifestyle Business vs Agency: Scaling Choices'
- header: 'Lifestyle Business vs Agency: Scaling Choices'
- line: I’d be happy to help, since we’ve published datasets on Kaggle before. But
    the main topic is freelancing, not datasets. Suppose I found a few clients after
    a couple of months—what’s next? Do I just continue freelancing, or is there a
    way to start a freelancing business or agency? Or is it fine to keep enjoying
    the lifestyle?
  sec: 1968
  time: '32:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on the person and their aspirations. If you start freelancing and
    find initial success, supporting your lifestyle, that's great. For me, I call
    it a lifestyle business. If you reach the level where you're not worried about
    getting your next client, that's when you consider scaling into a business.
  sec: 2033
  time: '33:53'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I tried this in my second year, becoming a small agency—getting more clients
    and outsourcing work to other freelancers. I subcontracted four freelancers for
    one project, and nine for another. But managing teams, following up, and handling
    maintenance were pain points for me, so I decided not to pursue the agency model.
    Some people thrive in that setup and grow successful agencies, but it wasn't for
    me.
  sec: 2033
  time: '33:53'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Nowadays, I prefer being a one-person team. I’ll collaborate for the right
    opportunity, but mainly work with a handful of good clients. You don't need 100
    clients; a few good ones are enough to sustain you. Getting new clients is always
    a challenge, even after many years, but over time, existing clients refer you
    and offer more projects. The goal is to continue doing interesting work with the
    clients you have.
  sec: 2033
  time: '33:53'
  who: Dimitri
- header: 'AI Tools for Productivity: Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor'
- header: 'AI Tools for Productivity: Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor'
- line: I noticed my productivity surged after incorporating AI tools into my workflow.
    Besides Claude, do you use any other AI tools?
  sec: 2281
  time: '38:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: So far, mostly Claude. When I started using it, I found the 3.1 model was
    amazing for coding. Of course, ChatGPT came out with image features and I use
    it occasionally—sometimes subscribing, sometimes cancelling. I use it for generating
    images or for tasks related to Data Freelancer, like translating job descriptions
    or extracting skill lists from projects in other languages. ChatGPT was there
    from the start, so I'm very familiar with it, especially through the API.
  sec: 2301
  time: '38:21'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Do you use tools like Cursor or Lablable?
  sec: 2366
  time: '39:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not yet. There are so many new tools, sometimes I wonder if I should spend
    more time exploring, but I haven't so far.
  sec: 2372
  time: '39:32'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I recently switched from Claude to Cursor, since it embeds chat directly into
    Visual Studio Code and it's convenient for coding.
  sec: 2382
  time: '39:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: That makes a lot of sense, especially if you code a lot
  sec: 2412
  time: '40:12'
  who: Dimitri
- line: 'I wish I coded more because I do a lot of operational work these days. Another
    thing: you mentioned freelancing as a lifestyle business. What exactly do you
    mean by that?'
  sec: 2417
  time: '40:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, a lifestyle business means living my life on my terms. I don't have
    to answer to anyone, only myself. I decide where and when I want to work, whether
    that's on my couch or in bed.
  sec: 2435
  time: '40:35'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Nowadays, working from home is more accepted, especially since the COVID pandemic.
    But being a freelancer isn't just about working from home. For example, I used
    to change companies and countries, and when I asked to keep working from another
    country as an employee, employers would often say it's a legal issue. As a freelancer,
    I can move countries and keep working with the same clients, no problem.
  sec: 2435
  time: '40:35'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Being an employee means working on assigned tasks, but freelancing comes with
    an entrepreneurial aspect. You become your own business, experiment more, and
    create new possibilities to earn money or fulfill personal interests. For example,
    I built my job board and started my online course for data professionals interested
    in freelancing.
  sec: 2435
  time: '40:35'
  who: Dimitri
- line: 'I chose to build these things myself including coding in JavaScript, which
    I had to learn, often with the help of AI tools. When someone pays for my course,
    even if it''s a small amount, it brings satisfaction. It’s different from an hourly
    freelance project: you make money while you sleep and develop new skills and passions,
    like marketing or web scraping. You’re free to try new things. If something doesn’t
    work, that’s fine. For me, that freedom to experiment and control my time is what
    makes it a lifestyle business.'
  sec: 2435
  time: '40:35'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That makes sense you’re your own boss. You can decide to spend a day experimenting,
    others working with clients, and another looking for new projects. Even if a day
    doesn't bring in money, at least it's your choice. No one can tell you not to
    do it.
  sec: 2689
  time: '44:49'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Course & Community: Branding, Marketing, and Support'
- header: 'Course & Community: Branding, Marketing, and Support'
- line: Exactly. I also have an online course, Data Freelancer, for data professionals
    who have been employees but want to explore freelancing. Many don't know what
    to consider before making the move, how to attract clients, or what strategies
    to use. The course serves both people considering freelancing and those just starting
    out, with a foundation of knowledge, a downloadable PDF, and access to a small
    community of like-minded freelancers.
  sec: 2730
  time: '45:30'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Apart from the course, twice a month I organize community events often with
    guests teaching branding, outreach, or marketing for freelancers, instead of technical
    skills, because that's what we need to improve.
  sec: 2730
  time: '45:30'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Those are skills you rarely develop as a full-time employee, like marketing
    yourself.
  sec: 2845
  time: '47:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, and it's a valuable exchange. The course gives a foundation, but
    the community and live events help freelancers support each other by sharing experiences
    and actions.
  sec: 2857
  time: '47:37'
  who: Dimitri
- line: And all this is on datafreelancer.com, including your job board and freelancer
    rates, right?

    but you also set aside time for other ideas like the course. Do you do anything
    else?
  sec: 2913
  time: '48:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Diversifying is important. Besides promoting the online course, I've focused
    on improving my lifestyle business. I used to do mostly hourly pricing, but after
    becoming a father in 2023, I wanted more stability and time with family.
  sec: 2931
  time: '48:51'
  who: Dimitri
- line: So I've introduced a subscription model. Clients pay a subscription fee for
    ongoing access to my skills as their data analytics command center. We do 6- or
    12-month contracts. Clients can ask me anything, and I join their team meetings.
    This creates more predictable and stable income.
  sec: 2931
  time: '48:51'
  who: Dimitri
- line: My clients are usually small, founder-led e-commerce businesses. They aren't
    data experts, so they don’t overload me with tasks. We build trust, I push them
    towards the right actions, and if they don’t implement changes quickly, I get
    downtime to work with other clients. It works well for this type of business.
  sec: 2931
  time: '48:51'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I assume you have contract safeguards to prevent abuse. You clarify what work
    you do or don't do, right?

- header: 'High-Impact Analytics: Small Analyses, Big Returns'
- line: Yes. My clients are small teams who want a freelancer instead of an expensive
    agency. I’m clear that I can only handle one task at a time. So, for example,
    I’ll focus on building a dashboard and follow up when it’s ready. After four months
    of this approach with three clients, it's worked very well.
  sec: 3140
  time: '52:20'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Sometimes, the real impact comes from simple data exploration. For example,
    I spotted a client's payments issue just by filtering a table, leading them to
    recover $20,000 they were missing. For those small companies, that's a big deal
    almost like magic and strengthens our relationship. This model wouldn’t work everywhere,
    but it's great for businesses where trust is essential.
  sec: 3140
  time: '52:20'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That reminds me of Alan Weiss’s book "Million Dollar Consulting," which talks
    about retainers. Your subscription model sounds similar.
  sec: 3264
  time: '54:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: They are similar, but not the same. A retainer is usually tied to a set number
    of hours per month if you don’t use the hours, you lose them. My subscription
    arrangement isn't linked to hours. Clients know I'm available, but I’m not tracking
    or reporting my hours. I also avoid committing all of my weekly time, so I can
    scale up or down as needed. Some clients need just an hour, others ten, but the
    flexibility keeps it efficient.

- header: 'Pricing Strategies: Hourly, Project Packages, and Transitioning'
- line: The book also suggests moving away from hourly rates to packaged project models.
    That means pricing by project, not by hour, right?
  sec: 3407
  time: '56:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, and that’s important. With hourly work, there are limits unless you raise
    your rate. Projects generally have better margins because you control how efficiently
    you deliver.
  sec: 3447
  time: '57:27'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Hourly rates tend to reward inefficiency if you’re fast and good, you make
    less. The experts advise shifting away from hourly models, but it’s not always
    easy in practice. Hourly pricing is still helpful, especially for new freelancers,
    or when project requirements are unclear. There’s nothing wrong with hourly work
    for trustworthy clients, and sometimes it fits the project better.
  sec: 3447
  time: '57:27'
  who: Dimitri
- line: 'We have an audience question: How do you transition into freelancing with
    a three-month notice period, which is common in Germany? Projects often need short-term
    availability, but you might not be able to start right away.'

- header: Notice Periods & Transition Planning for Freelancers
- header: Notice Periods & Transition Planning for Freelancers
- line: When I switched, I had a very long notice period of six months. One secure
    way is to ask your employer if you can continue working with them as your first
    client once you go freelance.
  sec: 3662
  time: '1:01:02'
  who: Dimitri
- line: If you can't, it's tougher for contract work, as most clients want someone
    immediately. The key is to start researching and networking early. Contact recruiters,
    share your profile, and ask about upcoming projects. They provide useful market
    feedback and can help you tailor your CV to land clients.
  sec: 3662
  time: '1:01:02'
  who: Dimitri
- line: When I handed in my resignation, recruiters told me about several live opportunities,
    which gave me confidence. Things can always change in a few months, but doing
    your research and talking to other freelancers helps. My community lets people
    connect with freelancers across Europe.
  sec: 3662
  time: '1:01:02'
  who: Dimitri
- line: At some point, you have to take the leap. There will always be risks just
    like switching to a new employer and facing layoffs during a probation period.
    Being an employee isn’t as secure as people often think.
