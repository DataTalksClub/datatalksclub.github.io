title: "Context: The episode follows the end-to-end effort to create a domestic risk assessment tool—framing the problem, assembling and preparing data, designing and evaluating models, addressing privacy, ethics and legal needs, integrating with frontline workflows and interfaces, engaging stakeholders, monitoring performance, and planning for scale, funding, and reproducibility.

Core theme: Designing and operationalizing a people-centered, data-driven domestic risk assessment that translates technical rigor into trustworthy, ethical, legally compliant, and user-friendly decision support—balancing accuracy, fairness, privacy, and sustainability so models meaningfully improve frontline triage and resource allocation in the real world."

description: 'Learn to build a domestic risk assessment tool: data cleaning, risk scoring models, privacy and deployment strategies to improve triage and resource allocation.'
intro: 'How do you build a domestic risk assessment tool that meaningfully improves triage while protecting people’s privacy and avoiding bias? In this episode, Sabina Firtala from Frontline’s AI product development walks through the end-to-end process of building a domestic risk assessment tool for triage. Sabina brings hands-on experience across data wrangling, visualization, statistical testing, model training and validation, with a background in Natural Sciences and prior analyst roles in finance and SaaS, plus freelance work for mission-driven projects. <br><br> We cover problem framing and project scope, data sources (case management systems, public records, surveys), and data preparation: cleaning, linking and feature engineering. Sabina explains risk scoring and model architecture, evaluation metrics and bias assessment, and practical privacy, ethical and legal compliance measures. Deployment topics include integrating risk tools into frontline workflows, user interface and decision-support design, stakeholder training and trust, plus monitoring for model drift and alerts. The episode also addresses operational constraints, partnerships, funding and open resources. Listen for concrete guidance on building, evaluating and deploying a domestic risk assessment tool—focused on impact, fairness, privacy and sustainability.'
