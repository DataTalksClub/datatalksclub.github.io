title: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of GPT
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about GPT, LLMs, and building NLP products. Interestingly,
    in the last year, we did not have any talks about the LLMs or GPT, but today is
    our second one in a row. The previous podcast interview was also about the LLMs.
    This is purely coincidental, we did not plan to have two interviews about LLMs,
    but this is how it happened. We'll try to cover something new that we did not
    cover previously.
  sec: 75
  time: '1:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: We have a special guest today, Sandra. Sandra is not new to DataTalks.Club.
    You might have seen her answering questions in our Book of the Week event with
    her book about GPT-3, Building Innovative NLP Products Using Large Language Models.
    Sandra is an AI entrepreneur, evangelist, and community builder. She has done
    a lot of amazing things. She will probably tell us more about that today. Welcome
    to our podcast.
  sec: 75
  time: '1:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks for having me, Alexey. Super, super excited to be here. Yeah, let's
    do this. I'm not surprised that it's the second interview about LLMs because they're
    everywhere right now. [chuckles]
  sec: 146
  time: '2:26'
  who: Sandra
- line: Yeah. I mean, we are kind of late to the party, because everyone was talking
    about the LLMs half a year ago. I don't know how it happened, but we were a bit
    late. But now, we have two events in a row. Better late than never. The questions
    for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, as always
    for your help. Yeah, let's start with the interview.
  sec: 160
  time: '2:40'
  who: Alexey
- header: Sandra's background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of LLMs and GPT, let's start with your background.
    Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 185
  time: '3:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. In terms of when I joined the space – it was five years ago. I was always
    interested in artificial intelligence adoption, [meaning the questions of] what
    people will do with AI tools once they're out there, how it will impact their
    everyday life, how it will impact business, etc. I started by actually starting
    my own project – an accelerator for startups called Nextgrid – together with my
    co-founder, Mathias. With Nextgrid, we were aiming to support startups at the
    earliest stage so POC (or pre-POC) stage, that want to be more business-savvy
    and want to gain further financing and validate their concept further. Next to
    Nextgrid, we also co-founded a hackathon event platform. It used to be called
    Deep Learning Labs, but it got rebranded to Lablab.AI, so if you want–you can
    check it out. If you're looking to participate in hackathons that use the latest
    tech, that's the one for you.
  sec: 195
  time: '3:15'
  who: Sandra
- line: So, through that, we basically tried to get closer to artificial intelligence
    ourselves, but also let others play with the latest tech out there. It was around
    2018, so the access to models started getting easier and easier. We were able
    to spin up an environment, plug into Open AI Gym, and train a reinforcement learning
    lunar lander or something like that – so, make a hackathon out of it. We started
    doing these hackathons and at some stage, I stumbled upon the next-generation
    models. At that time, GPT-2 was out and GPT-3 was about to be out. I really wanted
    access to it… I have a friend named Bakz that I want to say “hi” to – he has a
    YouTube channel. He started making YouTube videos about GPT-3 and also how he
    got access to GPT-3 – how he got into the beta list. He got it by making a video
    about it, so I figured that I might do the same because I really wanted to play
    with it.
  sec: 195
  time: '3:15'
  who: Sandra
- line: Basically, that's how my YouTube channel started. It actually works – I did
    two videos about different types of GPT-3 demos [that] I've seen out there at
    our hackathons, but also beyond. And I got access to it. So I started fooling
    around with it, basically. The channel got traction. I wasn't expecting such traction
    so quickly but there seemed to be already, back then… It feels like ancient history
    because that was like three years ago, [but there was] interest in exploring this
    subject. It was quite a small community at the time, but once you talked about
    it, you were pretty recognizable. I did all sorts of things – talked to the founders
    that were building with GPT-3, tested new tools that were coming out to the markets,
    played AI dungeon, and stuff like that. It was really fun – generating Christmas
    present ideas, things like that.
  sec: 195
  time: '3:15'
  who: Sandra
- line: Then I got approached by my future book author, Shubham Saboo. He offered
    to write a report together about GPT-3. But then, the publisher we were working
    with offered that we write a book about it. For me, it was a great opportunity
    to kind of get out of my imposter syndrome and start diving deeper into the field.
    The book was talking about the business side of things, but also the tech side
    of things. Once I went down the rabbit hole, I just felt like, “This is really
    my domain and I don't want to get out of it.” [chuckles] So I stayed. And now
    I am working for Cohere, which is developing state-of-the-art LLMs, and I am building
    a community there. I'm [also] focusing on education about large language models,
    which brings me here today as well.
  sec: 195
  time: '3:15'
  who: Sandra
- header: Making a YouTube channel to break into the LLM space
- line: That's quite a fascinating story – how you made a video to just get access
    to GPT-3. I'm wondering if today… I still don't have access to GPT-4, I think
    because I never used my API – I didn't put any money into it. Even though I'm
    paying for ChatGPT, I never put any money into the OpenAI API. So I still do not
    have access to GPT-4. I'm thinking if I make a video about GPT-4 now, it will
    not help. [laughs] Because the community is so large.
  sec: 488
  time: '8:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it exploded. The scale of things is just mind-blowing. There are so
    many videos right now about this. But back then, three years ago, it was a handful
    of people just exploring it. It was very new and now, it's exploded, and the market
    adoption and interest are huge. We are in a very interesting time when it comes
    to LLMs.
  sec: 520
  time: '8:40'
  who: Sandra
- line: How did you actually make a video without having access to GPT-3?
  sec: 550
  time: '9:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was just talking about different types of use cases that I saw for the future.
    Also, different types of “play projects,” toy projects that people had at the
    time, that I found pretty fascinating. That seemed to have been enough to get
    me in. [chuckles] If you're looking for a hack for the future, [I say] try any
    angle you can to get somewhere, whether you know about it or not – whether you
    have access or not. Yeah, you can do that.
  sec: 555
  time: '9:15'
  who: Sandra
- line: Maybe with GPT, it's kind of late because the community is pretty large now.
    But for the next big thing, it could be a good solution. Right? [Sandra agrees]
    Quite interesting.
  sec: 588
  time: '9:48'
  who: Alexey
- header: The business cases for LLMs
- line: So your book is about the business and tech side of GPT and LLMs, right? [Sandra
    agrees] What business cases are there for using GPT?
  sec: 600
  time: '10:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a huge question, actually – right now, especially. At the time,
    when we were writing the book (that was three years ago) we were talking to folks
    across different verticals like the entertainment industry, creative studios,
    sales assistants, code generators, or chatbot providers. They were all using GPT
    models (text generation models) in their particular context. Already at the time,
    you could see both startups and more mature companies playing with it and trying
    to adopt it – slowly, slowly. But since then, so much has happened on the market,
    that I don't really see how… Next-generation models are not relevant to a particular
    industry. You can basically use them for any type of industry.
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Sandra
- line: I'd like to say that with LLMs, we're kind of in this next technology wave,
    like we were in the past with a web browser – or even before with personal computers.
    We got this completely new type of tool to interact with our machines using human
    language. And through that, I can envision that we are just at the beginning of
    it, even though it's already been five years since transformer architecture (the
    foundational architecture for LLMs) was founded. But these were the very, very,
    very early days of the very long future business adoption, and all sorts of projects
    built on top of it. It's also worth mentioning that GPT types of architectures
    are trademarked by Open AI right now, But you can have similar generative pre-trained
    models that don't have “GPT” in the name but have very similar capabilities.
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Sandra
- line: Overall, we just call them text generation models – things like Claude or
    Cohere's Command, or open source models that generate text that doesn't come from
    Open AI. These are text-generation models. Next to them, there's also another
    group of language models called text understanding models that… Well, they are
    text understanding models – they help machines to understand the text better –
    but they're called embedding models. With these two, you have all sorts of business
    cases right now. You can also merge the two (combine the two) to power even more
    creative use cases. Right now, roughly speaking, for text generation, you have
    very popular use cases like – any type of text manipulation. It can be copy creation,
    it can be support chat assistance, personalized chatbots, AI friends, AI therapists
    – [chuckles] any kind of use case where you converse with the models. It's very
    popular right now. Also, [use case] where you manipulate text.
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Sandra
- line: When it comes to text understanding, a very popular use case is memory for
    these chatbot-type of systems, where the model is able to converse with you in
    a personalized way by remembering all the intricate details of your conversation
    or the context that you have given it so far – it has to translate all this into
    its own sort of way. It translates it to numbers, and then it retrieves it from
    there and keeps talking to you. Basically, this is what you use embeddings for
    a lot these days. Also, you can use them for semantic search, which is, roughly
    speaking, a new type of search engine where instead of keyword matching, you use
    semantic similarity between different words and sentences to retrieve information
    based on any query. This is a more accurate way to retrieve information that has
    a better chance of hitting precisely the user intent behind it. Because oftentimes,
    when we do a keyword search, we don't necessarily find what we're looking for.
    I mean, Google Search is a very common experience [that showcases] this – you're
    typing in something and then going to scan through all these results. Maybe on
    the first page, you'll find something most of the time, but a lot of this information
    is just not really relevant. With semantic search, it helps you to hit that sweet
    spot faster and more accurately.
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Sandra
- line: You mentioned that you had a company Nextgrid, where you supported startups
    at the POC stage. Are you still doing any of that? Or are you fully focused on
    Cohere right now?
  sec: 953
  time: '15:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm fully focused on Cohere. However, I exist at the company, but I'm within
    the orbits, let's say.
  sec: 969
  time: '16:09'
  who: Sandra
- line: The reason I'm asking about that is because I'm pretty interested in Nextgrid,
    or maybe other incubators. How many more use cases of GPT or LLMs do you see right
    now? Is it at 50% or 30%? Do you have any number for that? Are most of them LLM-based
    POCs now?
  sec: 978
  time: '16:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, most of them. In the beginning, when we were founding Nextgrid, there
    were no startups that were trying out the adoption of text generation or text
    understanding models (LLMs). But right now… I mean, it's also because right now,
    it's kind of the most popular thing there is. From the VC side of things, folks
    are really interested in the big phrases like “generative AI” and “large language
    models,” so startups have a huge incentive to somehow figure out a way to use
    them in their own company if they want further financial support. So that's kind
    of how it works right now, as far as I know. But it's a great time – it's a wonderful
    time to go out there and explore different problems where you can apply LLMs and
    you can solve actual things.
  sec: 1002
  time: '16:42'
  who: Sandra
- line: My opinion is (and I think it's a popular one) that you first and foremost
    need your tool to be useful in order for it to be adopted by others and for others
    to start using it on a daily basis and just… stop envisioning life without it
    in the future. It takes a lot of insights into how people are doing things and
    what bothers them, to be able to find it and then use LLMs to solve it further.
    Copywriting is a great example. We have all sorts of social media right now –
    social media platforms – and it's overwhelming to be able to sustain a presence
    on YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, LinkedIn, and what have you. I probably missed something
    – Twitch, Discord. [chuckles] There are all sorts of places where you can be at
    right now. Threads! Oh, yeah, Threads, Instagram, Facebook, etc. So the reason
    these copy-generation platforms are so popular right now is because we just want
    to automate a lot of the writing for social media. We don't like that it can be
    repetitive, but it's important to communicate with the world these days so this
    is where LLMs can help a lot. That's just one example.
  sec: 1002
  time: '16:42'
  who: Sandra
- header: LLMs as amplifiers
- line: With this example – it's actually a pretty interesting example. It's good
    that you brought this up because to me, it feels like right now if we rely on
    our LLMs for generating content on social media – doesn't it become less authentic?
    Instead of just writing copy ourselves, we rely on an AI model to do that, and
    then we just flood all these social media platforms with generated content. So
    not only does it become less authentic, it kind of becomes repetitive. Sometimes
    you just can recognize that “Okay, this was clearly not written by a human.” Sometimes
    you just start seeing these generated posts, right? So what do you think about
    this? Is it actually a good idea to replace copywriters with LLMs? Or maybe instead
    of replacing them, we should somehow help them?
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I totally get the example of being able to tell whether something was
    generated by a model or not. I can see that myself on my social media feed lately,
    where I am sometimes very confident in being able to tell that, “Okay, this was
    probably done using ChatGPT or something similar.” So, in my opinion, the way
    it works is LLMs are an amplifier – a tool that amplifies already existing processes
    and executes already existing intent behind this process.
  sec: 1224
  time: '20:24'
  who: Sandra
- line: So if a given person doesn't particularly care about being authentic, but
    rather wants to get to a certain place, (number of followers, number of sales,
    etc.) they will not prioritize being authentic. They will prioritize getting the
    message across, doing it as fast, and as widely as possible. So you have a lot
    of inauthentic messages, even before LLMs. You had people just doing it for the
    sake of not connecting with others, but rather maybe selling it. Now they just
    have a way easier time doing that. [chuckles] So maybe you just see more of it.
    But the initial process was already there – the initial intent behind it was already
    there.
  sec: 1224
  time: '20:24'
  who: Sandra
- line: Yeah, I understand. What you're saying is that it's actually good for some
    purposes, and we already had this sort of generated content, except maybe before
    (when it was generated by humans) it was worse quality, and it was more expensive.
    Right now we can rely on LLMs (on GPT) to generate this content and maybe get
    more exposure for our content or our brand, right?
  sec: 1330
  time: '22:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, it's helpful, especially when you're small or when you're at
    a certain scale, and you just want to grow bigger and bigger, which is usually
    what businesses want. So you can just do it faster – you can have better quality
    of the output. I still think that there is a lot of curation of the content generated
    by text generation models to be done before you press “Publish”. If you don't
    do that, then you risk being “discovered” [chuckles] by attentive readers. But
    yeah, I think if you want to have a consistent brand and consistent communication,
    you need to curate these things. You need to be the final decision-maker when
    it comes to the shape of things.
  sec: 1357
  time: '22:37'
  who: Sandra
- header: The befits of keeping a human in the loop when using LLMs (AI limitations)
- line: So instead of fully automating and just letting GPT go wild and generate all
    the social media posts, we still need to have a human in the loop – maybe a copywriter
    that edits these things before they go live (before we publish them). Right?
  sec: 1409
  time: '23:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely. I mean, it's not uncommon to see models hallucinate and just make
    up facts that are not accurate – that are not there in reality – or twist certain
    things or mix up a communication style, or…There are so many things that they
    can have a “bump” with, that I think it totally makes sense to have a human in
    the loop and always make sure that there's somebody very attentive – really invested
    in making sure that this content (whatever it is) is coming out as coherent, consistent,
    good for the brands or consistent with the brand. Otherwise, you risk some random
    stuff here and there.
  sec: 1425
  time: '23:45'
  who: Sandra
- line: My favorite example is when you type in “AI model” into Amazon search, and
    you get a lot of product descriptions (a lot of products) where people are just
    copy/pasting from a copy generation tool (AI model is a common phrase). However,
    they didn't edit it, they didn't delete [this part] – they just pasted it and
    published it on Amazon. And now we have a lot of descriptions including this phrase.
    That's pretty hilarious.
  sec: 1425
  time: '23:45'
  who: Sandra
- line: It usually says “As an AI model I cannot be sure that this thing is actually…”
    Sometimes it says this thing, “As an AI model, I cannot know the future.” Right?
  sec: 1519
  time: '25:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it tries to be a bit reserved when it comes to what it can and cannot
    do. That's usually having users in mind, because people are asking models about
    all sorts of things, and they personify the models very easily – they assign them
    a certain authority that the models don't have. So it's just a precaution to make
    sure that you don't take medical advice without consulting somebody from an AI
    model, or legal advice. There are all sorts of things that the model is not qualified
    for but is being asked about. So it tries to be helpful but with certain constraints
    as an AI model.
  sec: 1532
  time: '25:32'
  who: Sandra
- line: Yeah, I remember I wanted to talk to somebody about a contract I wanted to
    sign. Of course, I thought, “Hm… let me ask ChatGPT.” So I copied the contract,
    put it in there, and asked, “Hey, is there anything suspicious about this contract?”
    And then it said, “Oh, it looks like a typical contract, but as an AI model, I
    cannot give you legal advice. If you really want to be sure, talk to a lawyer.”
    Or something like that. Right?
  sec: 1585
  time: '26:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, another thing is just copy/pasting your information and giving
    it to a tool that's…
  sec: 1613
  time: '26:53'
  who: Sandra
- line: Safe?
  sec: 1622
  time: '27:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. In terms of your personal dataset safety, it's also probably not the
    best idea. So you need to be a bit cautious with that stuff. The companies that
    are training and giving access to large language models, they understand that
    very well. They understand that users tend to assign more authority or personality
    to the model than it actually has and just try to make sure that there are some
    guardrails. Of course, they won't always work, and they are very annoying at times
    when you are looking for help, and you cannot get it, because the models just
    keep saying, “I'm sorry, I don't know. I cannot say. I'm just a simple AI.”
  sec: 1623
  time: '27:03'
  who: Sandra
- line: It is very annoying.
  sec: 1674
  time: '27:54'
  who: Alexey
- header: Using LLMs as assistants
- line: Yeah, I know. I know. But then… I think the user experience there will get
    better with more specialized text generation models toward specific use cases.
    In the example of your contract, you will be able to have a conversation with
    a chatbot that has the same capabilities but is trained in specific laws. I don't
    know which country this contract was written in – but it could be German law or
    the Polish law here, where I am.
  sec: 1676
  time: '27:56'
  who: Sandra
- line: Also, it would be secure enough so that you can have it on your machine without
    it going outside and using your data further. And also being able to interact
    with a chatbot that is as close to a legal assistant as possible. I think this
    is where we're heading, kind of. Maybe not when it comes to personal productivity,
    because GPT is still great for it, but when it comes to more professional productivity
    and trying to use it for any sort of business tasks.
  sec: 1676
  time: '27:56'
  who: Sandra
- line: I imagine it can be useful even for lawyers because they cannot remember all
    the laws. In Germany (in Berlin) it's pretty common to… For example, if I don't
    need a book, instead of throwing it away, I just put it on the street saying,
    “For taking”. It's a present that anyone can take. Recently I saw a box full of
    law books, and they are huge – they are super thick. They're gigantic books. And
    there were many of them – a pile of these books. So I was wondering, “Oh my god,
    it's good that I'm not a lawyer. I don't need to remember all these things.”
  sec: 1758
  time: '29:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I imagine that for lawyers, it's pretty difficult because they need to go
    through these books – they need to know what things are in there to be able to
    help their clients. Probably, they would also benefit from such a model because
    it can just consume the book, digest the book, and then you can just ask questions
    like, “Here is the case I'm working on. Which book should I consult about this
    case?” And [the model] can say, “Okay, it appears that this book, page 10,059
    talks about that.” Right?
  sec: 1758
  time: '29:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. And then it's not only books, but the law keeps changing, right? There
    are new laws being added on top of it – some become extinct, so you need to keep
    up. Also, we have cases that are far from obvious, so it's far from just like
    searching for the information in the book and then being able to get a perfect
    answer for it. As a lawyer, I think having a helpful assistant in the form of
    a language model that you can just ask about a certain fragment of a contract,
    or a certain fragment of a given law quoted and then also help you reason through
    the situation. [It would] help you reason through the defense arguments or something
    like that – I think it's going to be super useful for lawyers and for other professions
    as well. It's useful for me already when…
  sec: 1843
  time: '30:43'
  who: Sandra
- line: You don't only use models for getting access to certain information or generating
    some sort of information that you want to use further but also as a sparring partner,
    basically – as a thought process aid, when you just want to get the ball rolling,
    start thinking about it, and then kind of help to think through it. Because dialogue
    is a very powerful way to think through things and being able to have your own
    personalized dialogue assistant plugged into any type of data that you need –
    I mean, who wouldn't want that? [chuckles]
  sec: 1843
  time: '30:43'
  who: Sandra
- header: Building an app that uses an LLM
- line: Yeah. So let's say I want to build an app using GPT or some LLM. How do I
    go about that? Say I have some idea… I think at the beginning of this interview,
    we talked about needing to talk to users, understanding their problems, and figuring
    out how exactly we can help. Let's say we did this. We found a problem that many
    users seem to struggle with, and now we want to create a POC around this problem
    – and we want to use an LLM for that. How do we go about doing that?
  sec: 1948
  time: '32:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: To get to the next stage, I will try to think about the model capabilities
    that you have access to, and then the type of the tasks that are needed in order
    to create this solution that solves this problem – there are certain steps to
    solve a particular problem. Are any of the capabilities of the model good for
    this type of task or this type of step? You need to try it out. You need to think
    through it. On the more pragmatic side of things, you also need to make a major
    decision about choosing your foundational model and with that, its reasoning capabilities,
    basically.
  sec: 1983
  time: '33:03'
  who: Sandra
- line: You can have models that are huge in size, huge in parameters as well, extremely
    capable, and very refined when it comes to their reasoning, but maybe slower or
    maybe not within the domain that you want them to be because they were trained
    on the specific data that [are not applicable to] your use cases. You also need
    to choose between a model that is an open-source model and a model that is a proprietary
    model. Here, your app flow will look completely different based on what this decision
    is.
  sec: 1983
  time: '33:03'
  who: Sandra
- line: If you choose an open source model, you will need to train it yourself – you
    will need to do the entire maintenance when it comes to keeping the model alive
    on your own premises, make sure it's up-to-date, make sure nothing breaks, etc.
    When it comes to proprietary models, it can be as easy as an API call to get the
    model's capabilities, but then you need to think about things like, “What is happening
    to my IP when I use a proprietary model?”
  sec: 1983
  time: '33:03'
  who: Sandra
- line: By “IP” you mean “intellectual property,” right?
  sec: 2125
  time: '35:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Yes, exactly. “Where does my data go? What is happening to it? How much
    can I trust this model?” These are very important questions to ask yourself when
    you're selecting a proprietary model. Then there are also a bunch of compromises
    you need to make. I've already mentioned that you can have a big model that's
    the latest, the greatest – the GPT-4 and any other future champion – but it can
    be maybe too expensive to call it all the time. And maybe when you use GPT-4,
    it doesn't adapt to your business. It's also pretty slow at the moment. So maybe
    that will annoy the heck out of your users, and you need to address that. So perhaps
    for your use case, it's better to go for a model that is smaller in size and that
    will do the task just as well, but faster and cheaper. It all depends on what
    kind of task it is.
  sec: 2128
  time: '35:28'
  who: Sandra
- line: You basically need to try it. It's painful, but you need to go and try different
    types of models, compare the outputs, and compare the outcomes. Then you also
    want to optimize your prompts when you talk to the generation models – that's
    another ballgame when it comes to… It's an art and a science. There are people
    called “prompt whisperers,” [or] “AI whisperers” that are able to communicate
    with models very… [cross-talk]

  sec: 2234
  time: '37:14'
  who: Sandra
- line: Okay. I've heard “prompt engineers,” but prompt whisperers? That's something
    new.
  sec: 2236
  time: '37:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: “Prompt engineer” is this new profession that's already out there. Basically,
    it's developers who are really skilled at creating prompts, comparing prompts,
    and making them useful in production for businesses. Prompt whisperers are folks
    that are at the top of the game – the ones that really can get the most out of
    the model using the smartest (the most efficient prompt). Because it makes a lot
    of difference how you structure your question, task description, what kind of
    flow it's going to have, whether the model can really quickly tune into what you're
    trying to do and follow you, or whether it's going to get confused.
  sec: 2241
  time: '37:21'
  who: Sandra
- line: There are so many things here that you can optimize for. Then, once you make
    a decision about your foundational model (that's one of the crucial things) then
    I think it's relatively easy to hook it up to any system – any setup that you
    may have. It may be because I'm in the LLM industry that I care so much about
    the LLM side of things. Perhaps there's a myriad of challenges that you, later
    on, need to encounter to be able to build this app, but from what I've seen, it
    can be pretty straightforward from there.
  sec: 2241
  time: '37:21'
  who: Sandra
- line: So the main thing we need to decide is whether we want to host a model ourselves,
    train our model ourselves, and do all this maintenance work, or we will rely on
    an external party and just make an API call. But for [the latter] case, we need
    to be mindful of what happens with our data. For example, in my case, when I copy/pasted
    the text of a contract – who knows what happens with this text? Maybe OpenAI uses
    this for training data and the next time somebody makes a prompt, it will just
    spit out my data. So I need to be mindful of that. And in the case of building
    an app, I need to be especially mindful because the data of users might be used
    by an external party, and we don't want that.
  sec: 2347
  time: '39:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: So we need to think about these things. We also need to select the right size
    of the model – should it be very powerful but slow, or should it be small but
    maybe optimized for a specific use case? Right? [cross-talk] So these are the
    things we need to think about. Then after that, we invest time into writing good
    prompts, right? That's mostly it.
  sec: 2347
  time: '39:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's mostly it. Then there's also fine-tuning. Models are trained on large
    amounts of data that come primarily from the internet. But then you have some
    sort of use case that requires specific lingo – you are building a chatbot assistant
    for a finance application and there are all sorts of financial language that this
    model needs to understand to be able to successfully execute tasks, and it doesn't
    yet because it wasn't part of its training data. Then, the fun thing is that it
    can quickly catch up to that. It's kind of like when you go through a general
    education and your reasoning skills are refined enough to be able to get into
    any domain and master the specialized lingo and also concepts within that domain
    and becoming able to really swiftly operate there.
  sec: 2421
  time: '40:21'
  who: Sandra
- line: This is the same as fine-tuning a model. You want it to go into a specific
    domain, so you give it a certain amount of data that will be applicable to your
    use case and you fine-tune it to make it better on the granular side of things
    when it comes to specific language, specific concepts, etc. The models differ
    here – there are models where you can do this very easily, there are models where
    it's not as obvious, there are models that you cannot fine-tune, and so on, and
    so forth. The choice of the foundational model will also impact the future ability
    to fine-tune it, and you need to take that into account.
  sec: 2421
  time: '40:21'
  who: Sandra
- line: I recently had a discussion about writing good prompts. I use GPT quite often,
    also for title generation. For example, for this podcast episode, I tried to generate
    a title with ChatGPT. Usually, when I say, “Okay, we need to generate a title
    for a podcast episode,” It typically comes up with titles like “An AI Journey
    with Sandra Kubelik,” for example. It tries to include the name. For people who
    don't know you, it might not be clear like, “Okay, what's there in this episode
    for me?” And then it generates 10 titles like that – with the name of the guest.
    What I usually do to avoid that is, I say in the prompt, “Do not include the name
    of the guest in the title.” But sometimes, despite that, it still includes the
    name of the guest even if I say, “Do not do this.” It still does that. And I had
    a discussion about that recently.
  sec: 2544
  time: '42:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: One of the suggestions there was that large language models, GPT in particular,
    have problems understanding negation – when you tell it not to do something, it
    does not always understand that. Instead, you should tell it what to do, instead
    of what not to do. I don't remember how exactly to fix that prompt – maybe instead
    of saying “Do not include the name of the guest,” you would tell it “We want the
    audience to understand how it will benefit them,” so you would include the reasoning
    behind not including this. I still have to try this and see how well it works.
    But, I'm wondering – do you have any other tips for creating good prompts? Perhaps
    you already experimented quite a lot with that and have a set of tips that you
    usually use for creating excellent prompts.
  sec: 2544
  time: '42:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean it depends so much on the model that you're using because the
    prompts do not necessarily translate very easily to other models. If you're optimizing
    for Coherence Command, it will not perform in the same way as Antropic's Claude.
    But the answer that is always there is iteration – you just need to try it a bunch
    of times, see how it performs, see which version use believe will work better,
    and maybe A/B test it with users. Because who knows, maybe the title that you
    think will be great will not be that great. [chuckles] Maybe there will be another
    one that will get more likes or a bigger reach and that's why the podcasts will
    get to more people. So what's always really useful is giving a model a few examples.
  sec: 2672
  time: '44:32'
  who: Sandra
- line: Text generation models are currently extremely savvy when it comes to what
    is called “zero-shot generation”. In other words, they're able to, without any
    kind of example, actually go and execute a certain task. But it's still very helpful
    to show it more precisely what kind of outcome you're expecting. In the case of
    the podcast title, maybe grab a bunch of titles (podcast titles, book titles,
    blog titles that you like, whatever) and give them to the model as inspiration
    – say, “Try to make it similar or as good as those.” I definitely agree with you
    that saying, “Don't do something,” doesn't necessarily end up being a successful
    command. [chuckles] And I kind of like it because it's good that models are rebellious
    – they need to be able to do their own thing. [Alexey laughs] But it's really
    useful to be very clear about the type of outcome that you want.
  sec: 2672
  time: '44:32'
  who: Sandra
- line: If you know that you like a certain style or that some you find something
    excellent, tell that to the model, and it will learn from there. If you want it
    to use certain keywords, tell it that. If you want it to optimize for SEO, tell
    it that, and it will do it. So the communication of your intent is very important
    and being able to be empathetic enough to share as much information as possible
    is also very important.
  sec: 2672
  time: '44:32'
  who: Sandra
- line: Empathetic to the model​?
  sec: 2852
  time: '47:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. To the model and to what it can do. Imagine that you're talking to your
    friend and you're asking about something. Your friends can come up with a title
    for the podcast that will not include the name, but will you like it? Maybe no,
    maybe yes. It will be a random, very subjective generation that you might not
    enjoy (or you might enjoy). But if you tell your friend about the type of effects
    you want to achieve – if you want the title to be catchy, if you want the title
    to be controversial, if you want the title to be very quickly attention-grabbing
    (because that's what we need in social media these days to get out there) then
    they will be able to navigate the situation better. Right? [Alexey agrees] So
    it's the same with models. It's all about just trying to empathize with it and
    trying to communicate as well as possible to get communication back that hits
    the spot that you're trying to achieve.
  sec: 2854
  time: '47:34'
  who: Sandra
- line: When you mentioned that we need to make a few iterations, I kind of started
    thinking about my iterations of the prompt for this particular use case of coming
    up with a title. At first, I thought, “Okay, I don't want to include names, but
    you still include them.” Then I thought, “What if I am polite and add 'please'?
    Will it help?” [chuckles] It did not. Then I thought, “Hmm… Let me try it in all
    caps. 'DO NOT INCLUDE THE GUEST NAME' as if I was shouting.” It did not help either.
    So unless you know that this is a thing you need to try – that you need to give
    examples – I would not necessarily come up with this tip myself at that moment.
    Sometimes you just need some practice.
  sec: 2931
  time: '48:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[It requires] examples, but also context. So give it as much context as possible.
    Maybe show the outline of the questions you''re trying to ask for this podcast.
    Maybe show the description (the blurb) that you''ve created internally for the
    team or for social media. Based on that, let it come up with something. I usually
    just give as much context as possible – as much as the context window allows me,
    basically. I just throw in everything and give it as much information [as possible]
    because usually, that''s what works the best.'
  sec: 2984
  time: '49:44'
  who: Sandra
- line: So usually it's smart enough to figure out what is important in this pile
    of information?
  sec: 3022
  time: '50:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. And if it's not, then you give it instructions. You say, “That wasn't
    great. Try another way and make it shorter/longer/sound nicer/sound more price/sound
    more chilled out.” Whatever you need. You can iterate based on what you already
    get but yeah, just [give the model] examples of the ideal outcome and as much
    context as possible.

- header: Sandra's 7-day LLM experiment
- line: We already talked about one of your videos, where you made a video about GPT
    without having access to GPT. That was a very interesting story. I have also heard
    that you have another YouTube video, where you integrated LLMs into your life
    for seven days. Can you tell us more about that? What was the experiment about?
  sec: 3061
  time: '51:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, of course. I'm always extremely embarrassed when I talk about why I started
    doing something that I did. But, long story short, I have been in the LLM space
    for three years now. I think it's only decent that I use a certain amount of large
    language model-based tools and I don't do that. I'm either too lazy to try something
    out, too impatient to tweak and improve it so that it works for my particular
    setup, or I don't know, I'm too attached to my existing process and to my own
    writing. So I decided to just challenge that and force myself to use different
    types of LLM-based applications, and image-based applications as well, to see
    whether they will help me or not.
  sec: 3087
  time: '51:27'
  who: Sandra
- line: It was surprisingly difficult to stay consistent. I felt almost like… It comes
    back to what we discussed before that, unless a person (in this case, me) has
    a very good reason to change something because it's currently painful, and you
    want it to be smoother, [the person] doesn't do that. You use tools for pragmatic
    purposes. You just want the effect, and you want to get there as fast as possible
    – you don't care about proving a point. I was kind of trying to prove a point,
    but also trying to see whether it would relieve the pain of certain aspects of
    my work. And I ended up staying with a bunch of them. For example, I tried this
    email assistant… Actually, I would say, it's just a general digital communication
    assistant from HyperWrite. And I am still using it to help me generate my emails,
    or generate a draft that I then improve. I'm also using it for creating my social
    media posts, for example. I did a bunch of experiments when it comes to creating
    a YouTube video itself. For example, asking a model to come up with an outline
    for a video, then coming up with a title – you went through this process yourself.
    It can be painful and you're not necessarily happy with the outcomes. Then coming
    up with a thumbnail for a video. Then coming up with a social media post about
    the video.
  sec: 3087
  time: '51:27'
  who: Sandra
- line: There's so much content that you can now generate with the help of a language
    model, but it will not necessarily satisfy you (it will not necessarily hit the
    results that you're looking for). And so a bunch of things like that where I would
    just never replace it that way. But then there were… Actually, there was just
    one application that stuck with me. [chuckles] One application that stuck with
    me and the other, well… I used ChatGPT in that example, but now I'm not using
    GPT. I use Coral from Cohere, but I use it daily as well for different types of
    things. It was useful. It was useful to force myself to experiment with this.
    And it gave me some food for thought when it comes to how much of my process I
    want to automate, how much of that ends up being fun for me, or ends up just being
    annoying for me because I feel like a teacher that has to go over this outline
    that is very subpar to what I'm looking for [chuckles] and teach them, “No, this
    is not how we're gonna do it. We're gonna do it the other way.” These are the
    types of things that do not give me joy.
  sec: 3087
  time: '51:27'
  who: Sandra
- line: I like to create, so I don't like to automate everything. But for social media,
    oh man – so helpful. Emails – so helpful. I hate writing emails. The things that
    annoy you the most, those are the best places to apply the language models. I
    see the highest chance of adoption there, definitely.
  sec: 3087

  who: Sandra
- line: Are the tools that integrate into Gmail and help write emails?
  sec: 3363
  time: '56:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, HyperWrite is one of them. It's a Google Chrome extension, that once
    you turn it on, whenever you open your Gmail account, and you start writing a
    draft, it's gonna give you an example email response, or example initial email
    – whatever you need, basically, based off of your existing communication, or what
    you give it, or the keyword that you give it.
  sec: 3368
  time: '56:08'
  who: Sandra
- line: Maybe I should try one. I need to answer quite a few emails, and sometimes
    I procrastinate and I end up at the end of the week with like 50 emails that I
    need to answer. Then I'm like, “Ugh. It's Sunday, and I need to answer these emails.”
    So I sit down and answer them and spend a lot of time [doing it].
  sec: 3404
  time: '56:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Also, sometimes, it's like… When you write an email, you need to think
    through the particular task that you're trying to solve and ask somebody for some
    [particular] thing. But sometimes you've done this process already so writing
    an email is only just re-iterating (putting it in other words). For me, it's frustrating,
    because the fun part (the thinking part) is done already. But I can take the thinking
    part, give it to the model, and then it will create an email for me as a time-saver.
  sec: 3423
  time: '57:03'
  who: Sandra
- line: Yeah. I just realized that we should actually be wrapping up and there are
    so many questions that I wanted to ask you but did not have a chance to. One of
    the things is that you have a very interesting profile (career). You did not mention
    that you have a degree in liberal arts, but then you ended up being in AI and
    doing LLMs. But maybe this is something we can talk about in the future. But for
    now, we should be wrapping up.

    a book. But this book is like two years old, right? So maybe some things are a
    bit outdated. Is there any other resource that you would recommend for people
    who want to learn more about LLMs? Maybe something from Cohere?
  sec: 3484
  time: '58:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, absolutely. We have recently launched something called LLM University,
    which is basically a free course for folks that are trying to understand large
    language model foundations both from the theory side of things, but also from
    the programmatic side of things of building stuff with it. So you have two components
    there. It's a very nice primer for whatever you're going to do with LLMs in the
    future. I definitely recommend that. My colleague from Cohere, Jay Alammar, is
    working on a new handbook for large language models, so follow that process. We
    also have a bunch of YouTube videos that are great. Our blog is also excellent
    when it comes to diving deeper into notions like embeddings, or semantic similarity
    or, how to build a chatbot, how to connect to a vector database, what kind of
    frameworks are hot out there. I really recommend our blog to get more tuned into
    LLMs right now.

    we should be wrapping up [audio cut off]. I think my connection is not stable.
    Unfortunately, I was not able to… I don't know if there are questions that some
