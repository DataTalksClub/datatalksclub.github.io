description: Discover a nonlinear path from classical guitar to production ML, semiconductors
  & yield analytics. Learn actionable career tactics and community-driven learning.
intro: How do you move from playing classical guitar to applying machine learning
  in semiconductor yield analytics? In this episode Dashel Ruiz Perez — a data analyst,
  ML engineer, and educator — walks us through a nonlinear career path that spans
  nearly a decade at Microchip Technology and now teaching programming and data skills
  through ThriveDX. With roles across production, process, yield, and software engineering,
  Dashel explains how hands-on production experience informs production analytics
  and ML engineering work in semiconductor manufacturing. <br><br> We cover practical
  topics including translating manufacturing problems into data science projects,
  building models for yield optimization, and the role of software engineering in
  production analytics. Dashel also discusses learning pathways — from degrees in
  computer science and data analytics at Western Governors University to graduating
  from ML Zoomcamp — and how community-driven learning accelerates skill acquisition.
  <br><br> Listeners will gain actionable guidance on career transition strategies,
  concrete examples of applying machine learning and data analytics in semiconductor
  contexts, and resources for growing technical skills through community and formal
  training. This episode is useful for engineers, data analysts, and anyone considering
  a switch into ML, AI, or semiconductor yield analytics.

  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: At Microchip Technology, he worked with complex engineering and production
    data before moving into software and machine learning. Today he teaches programming
    and data at major US universities as a lead instructor at Thrive DX. Welcome to
    our podcast.
  sec: 123
  time: '2:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you for inviting me.
  sec: 140
  time: '2:20'
  who: Dashel
- line: It is a pleasure to have you here. For me, it is always interesting to talk
    with graduates of our courses. I am also interested in learning about your career
    path.
  sec: 146
  time: '2:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is not very common. You started in the semiconductors industry and then
    worked in software and data. Can you tell us more about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Pivot: From Classical Guitarist to Tech in Portland'
- line: You are right, it is not completely common. Even before semiconductors, I
    was a professional musician. I came to the US in 2012 as a political refugee.
    When I got here, I was a professional musician.
  sec: 178
  time: '2:58'
  who: Dashel
- line: I studied classical guitar for nine years and was just playing music all day.
  sec: 204
  time: '3:24'
  who: Dashel
- line: Where are you from?
  sec: 211
  time: '3:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I am from Cuba.
  sec: 213
  time: '3:33'
  who: Dashel
- line: Are you in Florida right now?
  sec: 216
  time: '3:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I am in Portland.
  sec: 218
  time: '3:38'
  who: Dashel
- line: Okay. You are not the first person from Cuba I have spoken with.
  sec: 222
  time: '3:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is completely common. I went to Florida like every Cuban, but I did not
    like the city that much. There are too many Cubans. The US government placed me
    in a refugee program in different states.
  sec: 228

- line: Dashel
  sec: 228
  time: '3:48'
  who: Dashel
- line: Oregon was the least cold place of the states I could select, which is why
    I chose here. I love it here; it is really nice and not as cold as Pennsylvania
    or other places. We do not like cold weather; Cuba is like summer the whole year.
  sec: 228
  time: '3:48'
  who: Dashel
- header: 'Semiconductor Onboarding: Expediter Role and Fab Floor Experience'
- line: When I got here I could not speak English, and it was very hard to do anything.
    After a year I finally found a job at Microchip, which has a fab here in Oregon.
    The position was expediter, just walking with a little car to deliver wafers manually.
  sec: 289
  time: '4:49'
  who: Dashel
- line: That job helped me understand the flow of wafers through the fab. It was work
    where I had to walk a lot, about 25,000-26,000 steps every single day. I moved
    around to different positions until I got a process engineer technician position.
  sec: 318
  time: '5:18'
  who: Dashel
- header: 'Fab Data Exposure: Millisecond Tool Logs and Process Telemetry'
- line: That was when I finally got involved with semiconductors. Until that moment
    I was working in production, but then I started working with engineers running
    tests and experiments. I finally started working with data, and that was interesting.
  sec: 349
  time: '5:49'
  who: Dashel
- header: 'Self-Education: Learning English and Computer Science'
- line: Was your original education in engineering?
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, my education was music.
  sec: 382
  time: '6:22'
  who: Dashel
- line: Music? You first started as a driver, an expediter moving things in a truck.
    How did you manage to get an engineering position? Did you study in the meantime?
  sec: 388
  time: '6:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: First, I went to college to learn English. I wanted to be in a different position
    for several reasons. Being an engineer means more money and more responsibility.
    Another thing is I always wanted to know why and how things work.
  sec: 403
  time: '6:43'
  who: Dashel
- line: If you want to know that, you have to move out of production and start learning
    how everything happens. With a semiconductor, it is like magic. The way chips
    are made is completely insane. It is physics and math, but if you do not have
    an engineering background, it is really weird.
  sec: 426
  time: '7:06'
  who: Dashel
- line: It is very interesting even for me. I am a software engineer by education.
    If I needed to work with semiconductors, I would be completely lost. It is engineering,
    but for you with a music background, it was a completely different world.
  sec: 464
  time: '7:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was completely different. Was it that hard? Maybe by curiosity I always
    wanted to be like my friends. My friends in Cuba were software engineers or architects.
    I was the musician, but I knew about their homework in C++.
  sec: 490
  time: '8:10'
  who: Dashel
- line: I was there with them while they were doing homework. Finally, I was able
    to do something close to that. That is what drew me to data. Something interesting
    at Microchip, and I assume it is the same in other semiconductors, is that all
    the chip processes happen in tools, which are huge machines.
  sec: 529
  time: '8:49'
  who: Dashel
- line: You have different areas. I worked in four different areas at Microchip. Every
    time you need to run an experiment or analyze data, you have to check the log
    files for the tools. They have thousands of lines of data coming out, and it is
    very complex.
  sec: 563
  time: '9:23'
  who: Dashel
- line: For every second of the process, you have the amount of gases used, what tool
    it is, what plot. Some tools have six steps in different places. Everything that
    happens is logged; every detail like pressure and gas amount is recorded every
    millisecond.
  sec: 595
  time: '9:55'
  who: Dashel
- line: The log files for one hour are huge. You have to do that manually, sitting
    there with the cursor moving to see everything going on. It was too complex because
    it is not only the data; sometimes you see an error message. It is way more data
    than you think.
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Dashel
- line: Every single detail of the process is logged, including what should be happening
    in that step. That was really eye-opening regarding data in a semiconductor. It
    is way more complex. I assume Intel, which is huge and close by here in Oregon,
    does not do the steps manually like we used to do at Microchip.
  sec: 666
  time: '11:06'
  who: Dashel
- line: You learned to parse these logs? How did you get into software?
  sec: 698
  time: '11:38'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Automation Initiative: Building a Java Tool for CMP Calculations'
- line: In the beginning, I decided to go to college. I wanted to be a psychologist
    because I like psychology, but it was too hard. I liked software at the same time,
    so I decided to take computer science classes. I was in this position getting
    this data every single day.
  sec: 704
  time: '11:44'
  who: Dashel
- line: I was working in the CMP area, which is chemical mechanical planarization.
    When you grow wafers, you grow the oxide or material. To make sure everything
    is the right shape, you have to mechanically planarize the wafer. This is a very
    sensitive step.
  sec: 735
  time: '12:15'
  who: Dashel
- line: You have to check those logs every time something goes wrong. You have to
    do that manually. I made the calculations to fix the wafer or chips manually with
    my notebook. I had to do that every single day because I worked from 6:30 p.m.
    to 6:30 a.m.
  sec: 768
  time: '12:48'
  who: Dashel
- line: We always had issues, and I had to do it completely manually. I talked with
    my supervisor and said, "I am doing this every single day. I can write an application
    so I do not have to make the calculations manually." After six months I knew the
    wafer thickness by memory.
  sec: 801
  time: '13:21'
  who: Dashel
- line: I could manually calculate that one needed three more seconds and another
    needed four more seconds. I was right too many times. I said we need a procedure
    to do this, and I can write software to do it. He was very happy about that.
  sec: 830
  time: '13:50'
  who: Dashel
- line: I wrote everything using Java FX with Java to make the UI. When everything
    was done, they did not want to use it because the IT department wanted to use
    C or something else. I was very frustrated about that.
  sec: 852
  time: '14:12'
  who: Dashel
- line: Yeah, I can imagine.
  sec: 886
  time: '14:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: I talked with another person in yield. They were trying to find someone for
    a master's degree position. We started talking about the job, and I mentioned
    the data I was parsing and writing in Excel manually.
  sec: 892
  time: '14:52'
  who: Dashel
- header: 'Yield Analytics: JMP, Oracle, and Cross-Area Data Access'
- line: I was telling him we could do that automatically; we could write something
    fast in a week. He said, "I am trying to find someone to help me analyze data
    with JMP. Are you okay moving?" I said I was okay moving. I moved from the technical
    engineering position to the engineering position without the degree at that time.
  sec: 923
  time: '15:23'
  who: Dashel
- line: The last position I took at Microchip was working in JMP. There I was able
    to start doing the analytics and the engineering data part because I knew the
    data. It was very complex because there was too much data about too many details.
  sec: 958
  time: '15:58'
  who: Dashel
- line: It was very complicated. Engineers do not have access to the data outside
    of the fab. You have to go inside the fab, put on the suit, go to the tool, and
    do it manually. They have to go there to run an experiment. If you have a technician,
    you can rely on that person to collect data.
  sec: 980
  time: '16:20'
  who: Dashel
- line: You have to make sure the person is collecting the data and knows what they
    are doing. This is the way I finally got to yield, just from frustration. I did
    not want to do the same thing every single time because I was bored. I knew I
    could do more than just making calculations by hand.
  sec: 1012
  time: '16:52'
  who: Dashel
- line: In a fab like Microchip that makes a billion dollars a quarter, you have to
    follow procedure. I thought we could do that with software. You just put the thickness
    of the wafer and get the processing time. In the end, I think that software was
    never built in that area.
  sec: 1037
  time: '17:17'
  who: Dashel
- line: So the software you wrote was never implemented by the developers?
  sec: 1080
  time: '18:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, not in that area. I wrote other stuff with the data in yield that was
    used. I had a couple of projects that people adopted. My title was software engineer,
    but I learned during the Zoomcamp that I was really a data engineer.
  sec: 1087
  time: '18:07'
  who: Dashel
- line: I had access to all that data and was writing scripts in Python to clean it.
    I put that in an Oracle database and wrote small PL/SQL applications so they had
    access. It was more automation for my supervisor.
  sec: 1118
  time: '18:38'
  who: Dashel
- line: In yield, you try to make sure you have the data of the whole fab, what is
    going on, how many things fail and pass. Every request was about how to get this
    data. All my years in different positions at Microchip gave me access to how every
    area works and the data behind it.
  sec: 1151
  time: '19:11'
  who: Dashel
- line: I was curious and knew what was going on. That gave me an advantage because
    other engineers in the fab did not know what was happening in other areas. Moving
    around in production and as a technician gave me the opportunity to see how everything
    connects.
  sec: 1182
  time: '19:42'
  who: Dashel
- line: When they asked me to get something, I knew where to go and who to ask. I
    was able to talk with production people or engineers to ask questions and get
    answers. I was able to be successful with the data part of the job.
  sec: 1206
  time: '20:06'
  who: Dashel
- line: How did you become interested in machine learning and data in general? You
    were doing data engineering and needed to analyze a lot of experiments. Did this
    lead you to think machine learning could help you?
  sec: 1240
  time: '20:40'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'ML Introduction: Academic AI Project and Predictive Interest'
- line: Yes. In my last year of undergrad, we had a big final project. One of the
    last classes was AI, and they wanted us to make software that could use AI. I
    used the common house price dataset from Seattle.
  sec: 1262
  time: '21:02'
  who: Dashel
- line: It was interesting to predict something and know what was going to happen
    based on price. When I was getting all this data at Microchip, a question you
    always ask in a job with a repeating process is, "When is an error going to happen?"
  sec: 1299
  time: '21:39'
  who: Dashel
- line: That was always a question from my supervisor. We wanted to predict an error
    so we could fix the tool before it happened or take action to have better yield
    and more sales. I thought I could use machine learning to do that.
  sec: 1336
  time: '22:16'
  who: Dashel
- line: At Microchip, you have a schedule of tests, sometimes called quals, to check
    if a tool is ready for production. A tool might have a qual every two weeks, one
    week, or one month, depending on how many wafers it runs. Sometimes you feel you
    need to calculate based on the number of wafers processed instead of time.
  sec: 1368
  time: '22:48'
  who: Dashel
- header: 'Predictive Maintenance: "Wafers at Risk" Model for Yield Improvement'
- line: With the amount of data available, I thought it might be possible to predict
    this. I worked on a project about "wafers at risk." A tool processes a certain
    number of wafers every hour. For every thousand wafers processed, we need to check
    if the tool is ready, verifying the amount of particles and gases.
  sec: 1409
  time: '23:29'
  who: Dashel
- line: In the process, I wrote software that checked the entire production database
    for the whole fab. It took me about three months to count the number of wafer
    process steps and determine how many wafers were at risk for different tools in
    each area.
  sec: 1453
  time: '24:13'
  who: Dashel
- line: After I had all that data, I thought I could write something to predict how
    many wafers would be at risk if we kept working at the current pace. I did not
    need to wait. If my prediction was good enough, say 85%, I could tell the engineers
    to run their quals every 10 days instead of 15 days.

  who: Dashel
- header: 'Explainability Dilemma: Tweaking Models vs. Understanding Results'
- line: This would mean fewer wafers at risk, less waste, and more money. That was
    the beginning of machine learning for me. I remember running some algorithms but
    I did not have the knowledge. I was missing stuff.
  sec: 1516
  time: '25:16'
  who: Dashel
- line: Sometimes you run a Bayesian algorithm or a random forest and get 65% accuracy.
    You make some tweaks and suddenly you have 85%, but you do not know what happened.
    At that point, I could not use an algorithm even if I got the result I wanted
    because I could not explain the steps to my supervisor.
  sec: 1535
  time: '25:35'
  who: Dashel
- line: I decided I needed to learn analytics and machine learning to make better
    predictions. I fell in love with it because it was more interesting than making
    software that just does CRUD operations. CRUD operations felt a little boring
    at that time; machine learning was more involved.
  sec: 1568
  time: '26:08'
  who: Dashel
- line: I was also doing slightly more complicated stuff than CRUD. I remember the
    feeling that you can make predictions based on data; it is so amazing.
  sec: 1592
  time: '26:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it is very interesting. To understand the wafer process, I was taking
    courses to learn about atoms and how they bond, but it was too hard. I needed
    more math and physics classes than I took for computer science. I did not want
    to do that.
  sec: 1617
  time: '26:57'
  who: Dashel
- line: It was not really interesting, at least not at Microchip. Microchip makes
    old technology for blenders, refrigerators, and cars. The new chips for computers
    are made by Samsung, Intel, and TSMC. You are not at the front edge of the field,
    but the data was there.
  sec: 1642
  time: '27:22'
  who: Dashel
- line: When you do something and get a good result, you get the heat. When I finished
    the risk project and had the risk per tool per area, my supervisor was happy.
    I decided to add a page with basic stats like range, mean, max, standard deviation,
    and some prediction just to add spice.
  sec: 1675
  time: '27:55'
  who: Dashel
- line: He was very happy with that. It was not only the idea of predicting that in
    two weeks at this pace a tool would have an 85% chance with a margin of error,
    but you know you have a problem with a tool already. Now you are watching the
    tool to make sure that between 3 and 12 days you need to run a check.
  sec: 1713
  time: '28:33'
  who: Dashel
- line: If the measurements are where they should be, you can run the quals. If we
    stop processing due to an issue, we can wait a little. But you know what is probably
    going to happen in the future and you can plan for it. They were very happy with
    that. I thought this is something good; I can do more of this stuff.

  sec: 1785

  who: Dashel
- line: I went to Arizona State University for a master's in computer science. I think
    someone in my class told me about it. We were studying for a logic class using
    a weird language from a European university. I was talking about machine learning,
    and he said I should check it out.
  sec: 1817
  time: '30:17'
  who: Dashel
- line: I checked one of the public videos about the courses. Another time I decided
    to wait to learn more. One day I decided to check it out because 95% of internet
    content is not good for people beyond the beginner level. When you go more advanced,
    there is not a lot of good stuff.
  sec: 1873
  time: '31:13'
  who: Dashel
- line: I had finished my undergrad. I went to the GitHub page and thought it was
    good, but I decided to wait until the course began in September because I wanted
    the cohort experience. I wanted to be more engaged with the course, to feel the
    pressure of homework and asking questions.

- header: 'Applied Curriculum: Deliverable ML Beyond Jupyter Notebooks'
- line: I wanted to have that interaction. Waiting was a really good decision. It
    is so far the best course ever for me. I have access to DataCamp, Coursera, and
    LinkedIn Learning through my school, but in comparison, the quality of DataTalks
    is sometimes not even close.
  sec: 1942
  time: '32:22'
  who: Dashel
- line: The structure is the best for learning. It is not easy if you are not following
    along. You guys change the answers, and each new cohort starts fresh; you cannot
    check the previous one. I think that is good because it keeps you engaged. It
    gives you a push to continue when you get tired or something does not work.

    was using a Mac and had issues running it. It was a pain, and I could not run
    it. I moved to a PC and finished there. I remember talking with you on Slack,
    and you answered. The idea of having people in Slack to answer questions is awesome.
  sec: 2074
  time: '34:34'
  who: Dashel
- line: The Q&A works really well. For students, I really admire that the person teaching
    the class, with that many students, is able to be there and answer. It makes a
    huge difference. The material is taught better than on other platforms. Technology
    changes, and the models change with it.
  sec: 2155
  time: '35:55'
  who: Dashel
- line: The practicality of DataTalks is the huge difference. I finished a course
    on Coursera from a huge university, but you cannot use that course to do something;
    you just have some knowledge. I took a six-month boot camp in Mexico in Spanish.
    The issue with that university and others is that everything stays in a Jupyter
    notebook.
  sec: 2190

  who: Dashel
- header: 'Production Focus: Flask REST API, Docker, and Google Cloud'
- line: You know how the algorithm works and how to write a random forest regressor,
    but it never goes beyond the notebook. You run an inference and get a result,
    but it is just in a Jupyter notebook. The difference with DataTalks is that the
    goal is for the person to use it in real life.
  sec: 2249
  time: '37:29'
  who: Dashel
- line: You learn to put a model into a Flask application, get a result, and create
    a REST API with simple authentication. That gives you the idea that you can write
    this and it works. It is a huge difference to be able to use cloud providers like
    Google Cloud and integrate tools into the process.
  sec: 2272
  time: '37:52'
  who: Dashel
- line: This makes a huge difference in the quality of the course. When you finish,
    maybe you do not get a job right away, but it gives you the ability to do a really
    good project that shows you can do the job. It gives you the tools to write something
    good and nice that works in a company. It is not just a notebook; it is something
    real.
  sec: 2310
  time: '38:30'
  who: Dashel

    a game changer. I did the ML Zoomcamp and the MLOps course too. It is awesome.
  sec: 2346
  time: '39:06'
  who: Dashel

    were coming from COVID, and I had gone to Mexico. I got access through the school

    They had the paper and the data.
  sec: 2392

    data. I finished the project, put the API on Render, and told my friends they
    could send a request to get the data. Everybody said, "Oh, it is live and working.
    How did you do it?" This included people with PhDs and master's degrees.
  sec: 2428
  time: '40:28'
  who: Dashel
- line: They were impressed. I remember when I did my master's in data mining and
    inference, we did everything in a Jupyter notebook. You write the result, and
    it is just a paper and a notebook. When you finish the project, nobody can use
    it. It is just on your computer. If nobody uses your machine learning model, it
    does not matter.
  sec: 2468
  time: '41:08'
  who: Dashel
- line: DataTalks gives you the ability to make your stuff matter. You can put an
    API online and say, "Format the JSON this way and you get the result." You have
    three months to use it for free on Google Cloud. The process you teach includes
    how to use Google Cloud, set up a VM, set up Anaconda, and use containers.
  sec: 2510
  time: '41:50'
  who: Dashel

    notebook can finally use it. You are not getting that at a university. The courses
    on YouTube do not go to that depth.
  sec: 2544
  time: '42:24'
  who: Dashel
- line: Thank you a lot for such kind words. When it comes to machine learning, I
    remember my education was about how algorithms work, implementing algorithms,
    and a lot of mathematics. For me as an engineer, I want to make things available.
  sec: 2569
  time: '42:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: I want people to use it, right? That is the thing I learned at Microchip without
    looking for it. I remember my supervisor telling me, "It is good that you know
    how to predict that. How do I get that data? How do I get this result?"
  sec: 2600
  time: '43:20'
  who: Dashel
- line: If nobody uses the prediction, it does not matter. Everybody needs to know
    what is going on. I was just doing that. Usually, the idea was to know that beforehand.
    I was still in school, and my supervisor was kind enough to guide me through the
    process.
  sec: 2618

  who: Dashel

    to use Terraform."
  sec: 2676
  time: '44:36'

    That is awesome.
  sec: 2727
  time: '45:27'
  who: Dashel
- line: When it comes to Terraform, you said it is sometimes easier to use the web
    interface. While that is true, I have found that with AI coding tools, I can ask
    Cursor to create a Terraform file for me. It creates the file, and you just apply
    it.
  sec: 2752
  time: '45:52'

    enter, and it compiles. Some tools will even apply the plan for you. It is amazing.
  sec: 2774

    too.
  sec: 2801

    like cars; every one of them will get you from point A to point B.
  sec: 2846

  sec: 2933
  time: '48:53'
  who: Alexey

    I think it was a terabyte. It worked really well. The dataset had about 50 different
    types of butterflies.
  sec: 2941
  time: '49:01'
  who: Dashel
- line: There was one dataset that was light and another that was the whole thing.
    I downloaded the whole thing to make a better prediction. In the end, TensorFlow
    worked well with neither of them. On the small dataset, it worked just like the
    clothing dataset in the course. With ResNet, 85% accuracy does a good job.

  sec: 3022
  time: '50:22'
  who: Dashel
- line: I also do not like it, but it seems more popular now. People have been asking
    to switch to PyTorch. I see many students redo the course module in PyTorch instead
    of TensorFlow. I thought I might record a webinar to show how to do it in PyTorch.
  sec: 3030

  sec: 3113

    projects I did not finish. You start doing something and stop in the middle. I
    could finish them because the course is really good.
  sec: 3144
  time: '52:24'
  who: Dashel

    do not have to pay for DataCamp for a year to get this knowledge. On other platforms,
    you will have the knowledge but only be able to work in a Jupyter notebook.
  sec: 3164
  time: '52:44'
  who: Dashel
- line: When you finish, you will be in the same place. The hardest part is not making
    the model; it is using the model. You need to make the thing you built usable
    for others. You need to be able to deploy it.
  sec: 3189
  time: '53:09'
  who: Dashel
- header: 'Full-Stack ML Skills: Docker, VMs, Databases, and Deployment'
- line: In our field, it is more complex. Doing a machine learning model is not enough
    anymore. You need to know Docker, connect to a database, know a little cloud,
    deploy it, and know what a VM is. All that stuff is really important because it
    is the way you will solve the problem.
  sec: 3203
  time: '53:23'
  who: Dashel

    know how you solved the problem. If you know how to solve world hunger but do
    not tell anyone, there is still no solution.
  sec: 3228

    it will be different now with the M4. I remember having issues with the car dataset.
  sec: 3265
  time: '54:25'
  who: Dashel

    had a bunch of cars. I was doing the dummy variable encoding with get_dummies.
    The dataset was too wide, with too many variables.
  sec: 3287

    an error because I was not doing it the way shown in the videos. I remember a
    student from Brazil gave me a Python package that used KNN for encoding. It worked,
    but I did not get the same results.
  sec: 3315

  who: Dashel
- header: 'Time Commitment: Homework Strategy and Active Video Learning'

    too many variables. It is not hard; if you have a week you can do it. If you think
    you will do the homework in two hours, you are wrong.
  sec: 3362
  time: '56:02'
  who: Dashel
- line: The idea is not just doing the homework. The homework is there to help you
    understand what you learned. I usually did the code along with you. The videos
    were about an hour and a half, and then I started the homework by myself.
  sec: 3388
  time: '56:28'
  who: Dashel
- line: I tried to do it without watching your videos first. If I had an issue over
    and over, I would go back to the video. It was not impossibly hard, but it was
    hard enough to make me learn new things. It was not so easy that I did not want
    to watch the video.
  sec: 3420
  time: '57:00'
  who: Dashel
- line: It was challenging. Some stuff was easier, but some required more time. The
    cloud part was where I had to spend more time, slowing down the videos. I think
    the course is very balanced for the level I was at.
  sec: 3449

  who: Dashel
- header: 'Community Value: Rapid Help, Code Reviews, and Study Groups'
- line: If you do not know Python, it will be awful. If you do not know any programming
    language, you will need to spend at least five hours a day and watch the video
    twice. If you are at an intermediate level in Python, it strikes a balance. The
    Slack community is awesome.
  sec: 3487
  time: '58:07'
  who: Dashel
- line: The community in DataTalks is just awesome. Your question has probably been
    answered in the Q&A. If not, somebody will answer you. Nobody will just give you
    the answer outright. I wish we had this type of Slack in university.
  sec: 3522
  time: '58:42'
  who: Dashel

    in 10 minutes. I even studied a couple of times with a guy from Brazil. We made
    a study group. I remember talking with one person in Spanish who helped me directly.
    It was good.
  sec: 3552
  time: '59:12'
  who: Dashel
- line: Okay. Well, we should be wrapping up. Maybe the last thing I want to ask you
    is how did you manage to stay motivated? This is a long course with challenges,
    from September until the end of January, about four or five months. What would
    you recommend other people do to stay motivated?
  sec: 3595

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Motivation Techniques: Public Learning and Project Accountability'
- line: For me, it was the public learning on Slack. Seeing messages pop up on your
    phone, knowing people are doing it, helps. Think that in one or two months you
    will be done. When you finish, you will have at least two great projects to show
    future employers.
  sec: 3631
  time: '1:00:31'
  who: Dashel
- line: You will have a set of skills that allow you not only to understand machine
    learning but to do something with that knowledge. You will be able to really solve
    a problem. You will be able to deploy a project and give it to your neighbors
    to use.
  sec: 3667
  time: '1:01:07'
  who: Dashel

    is a huge learning experience because you have to reproduce their work. That happens
    in real life. Do not miss the community.
  sec: 3702
  time: '1:01:42'
  who: Dashel
- line: If you feel it is hard, just talk with people. You will see it is never easy
    for anyone. Life happens; you get sick or busy. If it is very hard, ask questions.
    Somebody will answer and give you resources. In my experience, somebody might
    even call you and go step-by-step.
  sec: 3783
  time: '1:03:03'
  who: Dashel

    hang out in Slack and say, "Hey, it is really hard," and you will have all the
    support you need.
  sec: 3815
  time: '1:03:35'
  who: Dashel
- line: I am really thankful for all the students who help each other. If it was just
    me, I would not be able to do this. When everyone is going through the same material
    and experiencing similar problems, you share and help each other. This is a great
    thing to see and it helps me manage my time with thousands of students.
  sec: 3833
  time: '1:03:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: As I said before, that is one of the distinctions. If you take a course on
    DataCamp, it is just you. When you finish, you will not have a real project because
    you work in their sanitized environment. In DataTalks, you have a real project
    with messy data.
  sec: 3873
  time: '1:04:33'
  who: Dashel
- line: You have to do all the steps. People will evaluate you, and you will see what
    others are doing. You have that support, the videos, and Slack. That is a huge
    difference. When somebody asks me why they should take this course, I say just
    take it and you will be fine.
  sec: 3901
  time: '1:05:01'
  who: Dashel
- line: You will have all the knowledge you need. You do not have to watch endless
    hours of random YouTube videos. You only have to watch one course. If I want to
    learn something like Terraform now, I do not search on YouTube. I go to DataTalks,
    to the third module. It is one stop, with good quality, and I can use it right
    away.

- line: It is real, not like a tutorial where you finish and still do not know anything.
    Many tutorials are the same thing with different people. This is really good.

  who: Dashel
- line: Okay, thank you a lot. We should be wrapping up. Thanks a lot for joining
    us today, for sharing your experience and your story about your career and how
    you discovered the course. I personally liked all the nice things you said about
    the course.
  sec: 4000
  time: '1:06:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is very pleasing to hear and will be very helpful for us. When we edit
    this, we can make posts on social media about your experience. This will help
    others decide to join our course. So thanks a lot for doing that.

- header: 'Teaching Ambition: Creating High-Quality Spanish ML Content'
- line: No, thank you. I really was not expecting you to contact me to talk about
    my experience. I have really good things to say. I tried to create similar content
    in Spanish because there is not a lot of high-quality material in Spanish.
  sec: 4056
  time: '1:07:36'
  who: Dashel
- line: When I received the email, I was surprised. I told my wife, and she thought
    it was crazy but good. I have been a teacher for classical music, software, and
    Python. Having a good teaching structure is important. Some people make tutorials
    but do not know how to teach effectively.
  sec: 4089
  time: '1:08:09'
  who: Dashel
- line: That knowledge is sometimes missing. With DataTalks, everything is there.
    The homeworks and projects are perfect. I was thinking it is a good way to do
    it because, teaching in schools, you are usually tied to a book. The way you do
    it is very good; I thought you must have been a teacher.
  sec: 4145
  time: '1:09:05'
  who: Dashel
- line: Well, I have a second degree as an English teacher, but we never studied pedagogy.
    I guess it is something I learned on the job.

- header: 'Upcoming Offerings: AI-for-Developers, React, and LLM Coding'
- line: The job you have been doing is amazing with that. I have been waiting for
    the next course about using React with machine learning or AI dev tools.
  sec: 4228
  time: '1:10:28'
  who: Dashel
- line: We will start the AI for Devs course in November.
  sec: 4254
  time: '1:10:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: I want to take it with you because I know it will be good. I know React, but
    I know I will learn a bunch of new stuff.
  sec: 4267
  time: '1:11:07'
  who: Dashel
- line: The idea there is not to learn React, but to use AI to write React code without
    knowing React. It is about LLM-powered coding. You can produce React code without
    initially needing to know it deeply.
  sec: 4279
  time: '1:11:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can get started without deep knowledge and learn as you build more applications.
    It is a good practice.
  sec: 4298
  time: '1:11:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think one thing that happens with people is they feel they need to know
    everything. When you watch videos, you feel you do not know anything. I wrote
    applications at Microchip in a scripting language called GSL for JMP software.
  sec: 4312
  time: '1:11:52'
  who: Dashel
- line: I wrote three or four applications that people used. If you ask me how GSL
    works now, I do not remember. I do not even put it on my resume after using it
    for two years. It is something people need to feel more comfortable with.

- header: 'Closing Remarks: Course Endorsement and Next Steps'
- line: Okay. Yeah. We should be wrapping up. Thanks a lot for doing this, and thanks
    everyone for joining us. It was fun. If you decide to join our updated modules,
    we will see you there soon.
  sec: 4369
  time: '1:12:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. I think I will. I think I will. I think I will. I am interested in the
    new stuff.

context: 'A single through-line: the episode is about a hands‑on, end‑to‑end journey
  into applied machine learning — a multidisciplinary career pivot powered by self‑education
  and cohort/community support that takes messy, high‑frequency industrial data through
  pragmatic tool‑building, model development, explainability tradeoffs, and MLOps
  (APIs, containers, Terraform, ONNX) into real production impact, with a commitment
  to teaching and scaling that practice to others.'
