transcript:
- line: This week, we will talk about a data product manager. We have a special guest
    today, Sara. Sara is a product manager at Meroxa, which is a company that builds
    data platforms that help software teams orchestrate and integrate data into their
    data-driven applications. Previously, Sara worked as a product designer for companies
    including Sora, Checkr, Change.org and Zendesk. Welcome, Sara.

- line: "Before we go into our main topic of \u201CBecoming a Data Product Manager\u201D\
    , let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey\
    \ so far?"
  sec: 87
  time: '1:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Where do I even begin? I guess I can start with \u2013 I made a lot\
    \ of transitions in my career, but one thing I've always known is that I wanted\
    \ to work in technology. For me, the entry point was actually a technical support\
    \ role at a large shared hosting company. After a handful of years in that role,\
    \ I felt pretty stuck. That company was based in Utah, and while there is quite\
    \ a bit of opportunity there in technology, there wasn't as much as I had hoped\
    \ for. There wasn't a variety of companies where I could say, \u201CHey, I can\
    \ work for this company and learn something new.\u201D A good friend that I was\
    \ working with at the company actually convinced me to move to San Francisco and\
    \ said, \u201CHey! If you want opportunity, San Francisco is the place to be.\
    \ I'm moving out there.\u201D He had just received an offer to work at a cloud\
    \ computing company and he was like, \u201CCome out with me and we'll figure it\
    \ out together.\u201D So I did the unthinkable and it was literally a decision\
    \ that I made within two weeks. I packed up all my stuff and we literally drove\
    \ out in the middle of a winter storm and moved to San Francisco."
  sec: 97
  time: '1:37'
  who: Sara
- line: "When I arrived in San Francisco, I didn't have anything lined up. But I was\
    \ comfortable with that. Through the generosity of friends and connections, I\
    \ was able to pick up a few technical gigs here and there. I'm going to fast forward\
    \ a bit to when I eventually landed a product support role at a company called\
    \ Zendesk. That's where my career actually made the biggest shift. At the time,\
    \ I had already been working with a lot of companies that use Zendesk for their\
    \ helpdesk and helping them curate their helpdesk experiences, so they can help\
    \ their customers. So it was working a lot around helping them design experiences\
    \ that could then ultimately result in \u201COh! Customers know where to go in\
    \ order to get this information or this information.\u201D We helped them brand\
    \ that experience and make it a bit more familiar."
  sec: 97
  time: '1:37'
  who: Sara
- line: "I ended up reaching out to the chief creative officer at the time. I was\
    \ actually trying to refer a friend for a design position. But I had mentioned\
    \ to him that I had a passion for design and technology. I showed him just a few\
    \ of the projects that I had worked on. Fast forward and I was suddenly in a room\
    \ interviewing for a product design role. And I got it. This was a huge opportunity\
    \ and I just feel so lucky. From there, my career grew. I went on to work for\
    \ a B2C company called Change.org \u2013 who are one of the world's largest online\
    \ petitioning platforms. Then I went to work for a company called Checkr, which\
    \ is a background check API company. Then I worked for a couple early stage companies.\
    \ So Sora, which is an HR data platform and then I arrived here, at Meroxa."

- header: "Product designer\u2019s responsibilities"
- line: "That's quite a journey. So, as a designer, what kind of things did you do?\
    \ When I hear \u201Cdesigner\u201D I imagine somebody who designs furniture or\
    \ tells you what your apartment should look like. I imagine that you were a different\
    \ kind of designer, right? What kind of things did you need to take care of? How\
    \ are the elements arranged on the website and things like that?"
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I love interior design and all of that, but the type of design I was
    doing was product design. A lot of that was taking product requirements and building
    user experiences through interface design. That involves quite a bit of user research,
    user testing, figuring out how customers expected to interact with our technology,
    the outcomes they were expecting, iterating a billion times, and trying to figure
    out what it was that helped their customers along.
  sec: 323
  time: '5:23'
  who: Sara
- line: So do you have to be good at design? Do you have to have a good taste to be
    a product designer?
  sec: 365
  time: '6:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think you have to have a foundational understanding of technology \u2013\
    \ you need to really care about customers (the people that you're serving.) I\
    \ feel like the more visual aspects that come in \u2013 that play a part in product\
    \ design \u2013 all of that can be learned. Depending on the size of the company,\
    \ you can usually get away with using an existing design system or component library.\
    \ You don't have to worry too much about things like, \u201COh, well, what color\
    \ should this button be? What kind of display should I use for this?\u201D So,\
    \ I would say, yes \u2013 you should have an eye for design. But it really comes\
    \ down to this: the best designers I've always known are the ones whose interests\
    \ are deeply rooted in solving problems for their customers."

  who: Sara
- header: "Data product manager\u2019s responsibilities"
- line: What do you do now, as a data product manager?
  sec: 424
  time: '7:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That's a great question. I actually work pretty similarly to how a regular\
    \ product manager would work. I guess the only difference here is that I'm working\
    \ on data products and not just feature products \u2013 or what people traditionally\
    \ think of as feature products. I do a lot of similar work around spending time\
    \ on understanding customers. For me, as a PM working on data products, that means\
    \ talking with and interacting with data professionals any chance I get. The goal\
    \ behind that is to understand things like \u201CWhat are the core responsibilities?\
    \ What are the problems that you're aiming to solve? What challenges do you run\
    \ up against? How do you get around them?\u201D"
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Sara
- line: "For a lot of my conversations, they often go towards more tactical aspects\
    \ of how they take requirements from all over the business and turn it into actionable\
    \ data. When I say actionable data, I mean data that's driving their applications\
    \ or infrastructure, or in some cases used in data analysis. From there, I take\
    \ a lot of my learnings from those conversations, or any other information I might\
    \ have, and start developing an understanding of the problem that we're trying\
    \ to solve and how we might do that, and help them accomplish that. The thing\
    \ I found specifically with data teams, is that not everything I learn necessarily\
    \ points to an obvious answer. I find that, depending on the type of company,\
    \ the type of requirements that they lay in front of their data team \u2013 that\
    \ really determines how that team operates and what the organizational motions\
    \ are for that team. Are they just building pipelines for data analysis? Or are\
    \ they powering their applications with real-time data? And why is that?"
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Sara
- line: "From there, I basically take all that information and occasionally reach\
    \ for some of the tools that they're using in order to figure out \u201COkay,\
    \ what's not working here? What are some of the pitfalls of the technologies and\
    \ tooling that they're using?\u201D Then I take all those findings, present it\
    \ to the internal stakeholders and partners that I have within our company, and\
    \ we align on whether or not this is the right problem to be solving, or if there's\
    \ something more that we discovered. Basically, it's just understanding data teams\
    \ and how they operate, and then formulating a hypothesis on the problems that\
    \ they're experiencing. Then further ideating on a couple of solutions and how\
    \ we think we can help them or formulate new approaches."
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Sara
- line: Yeah, that's quite interesting. I know nothing about product designers. But
    you described your responsibilities as a product designer previously, where you
    would also do a lot of user research. That would involve talking to users and
    understanding their problems, and then thinking about how you can actually solve
    these problems. Right? Or maybe I misunderstood you. But it seems like there are
    some similarities between what you're doing now and what you were doing previously
    as a product designer. Is that right?
  sec: 598
  time: '9:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, absolutely. Oftentimes product designers and product managers work\
    \ in close collaboration during this phase \u2013 I guess you can call it a \u2018\
    product discovery phase\u2019 \u2013 where we're really getting in the weeds with\
    \ some of our customers, or potentially prospective customers, to understand what\
    \ it is that they're trying to do. \u201CWhat is the problem?\u201D Then we just\
    \ validate some of our assumptions around the solution that we will eventually\
    \ embark on."
  sec: 629
  time: '10:29'
  who: Sara
- line: "So, \u2018product discovery phase\u2019. What other phases are there?"
  sec: 660
  time: '11:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Following product discovery, it's not just about the customer development\
    \ piece \u2013 there's also market research, researching the tooling, as I had\
    \ said before. Sometimes it's a little bit of data analysis, if we have data at\
    \ our disposal to kind of formulate an understanding of the problem. When you\
    \ say \u201CWhat's the rest of the process?\u201D Do you mean as the product designer,\
    \ as a product manager?"
  sec: 667
  time: '11:07'
  who: Sara
- header: Planning with the team
- line: "Well, I guess, when you said \u2018product discovery phase\u2019 I thought,\
    \ \u201COkay, that's just maybe phase number one and there could be other phases.\u201D\
    \ I assume there is some sort of process. So first, you do product discovery,\
    \ and then you do probably some other things. That\u2019s what I was thinking."
  sec: 698
  time: '11:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. So let me go into the process of planning with the team. A lot of that\
    \ I kind of covered \u2013 where we present our findings to stakeholders and partners\
    \ and we align on whether or not the problem we're trying to solve is the right\
    \ problem. From there, if the team is aligned and everything's a \u2018go\u2019\
    , we go into the process of working cross-functionally with engineering teams,\
    \ as well as designers, if the product solution happens to have an interface.\
    \ We really just go through a process of ideation. That involves a lot of rough\
    \ prototypes, like, \u201CHere's this specific goal that we're looking to meet.\
    \ How can we accomplish XYZ? How can we accomplish a specific experience that\
    \ we're targeting?\u201D"
  sec: 711
  time: '11:51'
  who: Sara
- line: "From there, we go through a couple reps of, \u201COkay. How confident are\
    \ we in the solution?\u201D Before that point, we try to figure out, \u201COkay.\
    \ Well, how are we going to measure the success of this?\u201D We generally have\
    \ success metrics in place to kind of articulate, \u201CWhat is it that we're\
    \ trying to accomplish here? How do we measure that against something?\u201D Sometimes\
    \ it's an actual metric like, \u201CWe want to see XYZ happen.\u201D Or sometimes\
    \ it's \u201CThe customer should be able to do this and they should be able to\
    \ do it effectively.\u201D"
  sec: 711
  time: '11:51'
  who: Sara
- line: "From there, we go through the process of engineering, \u201COK. We're going\
    \ to build this thing.\u201D We go through a few reps of demoing along the way.\
    \ Depending on the dependencies that are needed for the specific feature, development\
    \ can take anywhere from a few weeks to a month."
  sec: 711
  time: '11:51'
  who: Sara
- line: "Then I go through the process of product management, where if we run into\
    \ any potential like \u2018gotchas\u2019 and have to reevaluate how we're implementing\
    \ the solution, I coordinate with the team to make sure we can get through those\
    \ phases. Then it's the product launch process, where we work cross-functionally\
    \ with the \u2018go to market\u2019 teams of smart product marketing, potentially\
    \ other product stakeholders, design, etc. We kind of generate all the things\
    \ that we need to do in order to get the product to market. Then we go through\
    \ the release process. That\u2019s kind of the short description."
  sec: 711
  time: '11:51'
  who: Sara
- line: "Yeah, interesting. So it\u2019s the product discovery phase, then the planning\
    \ phase, then ideating, and then starting to think how you\u2019re going to implement\
    \ this thing and setting up KPIs. Then you actually deliver the thing with the\
    \ engineering team and then go through the process of launch after this thing\
    \ is engineered/created and actually release it. Did I get that right? All the\
    \ while, you as a product manager need to think about all these phases \u2013\
    \ all these steps \u2013 of the process, right? As a designer, previously, you\
    \ were mostly involved in the product discovery phase? Or were you involved in\
    \ other phases as well?"
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Mostly the product discovery, and then the execution phase, where we're iterating
    and developing solutions.
  sec: 903
  time: '15:03'
  who: Sara
- header: Design thinking and product design
- line: "I heard about this thing called \u2018design thinking\u2019 \u2013 is this\
    \ in the ideation phase? When you think, \u201COkay, here's the problem.\u201D\
    \ and then you think about how you can solve it. Do you, as a product manager,\
    \ also need to know these kinds of things and use them or not?"
  sec: 910
  time: '15:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: It really depends on the product manager. Some rely on the partnership with
    the product designer to guide them through that process. Some actually have a
    really keen sensibility for it. I think it really depends on the background and
    expertise of the product manager, but it's generally not the expectation. They
    should have an understanding of whether or not the experience actually delivers
    on the goals that they've set, or the requirements that they've set. But it's
    not always a requirement.
  sec: 926
  time: '15:26'
  who: Sara
- line: But from what I understood, having experience in product design is definitely
    helpful for transitioning into a product management role, right? Because there
    is some overlap, especially this product discovery phase and other things. How
    did you become interested in product management?
  sec: 963
  time: '16:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I've always been super fascinated with how companies work, and more importantly\
    \ with how they go about building products. I've always preferred to work in super\
    \ close partnership with product managers, as a designer. I\u2019ve always found\
    \ that I was never satisfied just fulfilling my own part. In particular, I was\
    \ super interested in working cross-functionally alongside our engineering teams,\
    \ understanding the systems driving behind whatever we were designing and building,\
    \ as well as the process of measuring success of a feature product. It wasn't\
    \ just enough that we launched something, it also included thinking, \u201COkay.\
    \ Well, how successful was this product release? Are customers able to get done\
    \ what they need to? Are they able to achieve whatever the product is meant for\
    \ them to do?\u201D Then, if not, \u201CWhat are some areas of measurement that\
    \ we can start iterating on? We realized this, but now what?\u201D This is a very\
    \ simplified example, but if we take a generic funnel \u2013 \u201COh, people\
    \ dropped off at this point in the user experience. Okay. Well, why?\u201D You\
    \ can then generate a series of hypotheses. You can go back to customers and you\
    \ can talk with them, and then develop an understanding and enhance that feature\
    \ down the road."
  sec: 986
  time: '16:26'
  who: Sara
- line: So you thought that you wanted to have a larger scope and work in cross-functional
    teams? Was it clear for you that you needed to go down this road of going into
    the product management role? How did you realize that this was actually what you
    needed? Because you already had experience working with product managers, right?
  sec: 1075
  time: '17:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. It's actually interesting. A few companies back, I was really pushing\
    \ the product team to conduct experiments. I was like, \u201CExperiments are super\
    \ easy.\u201D I earned that experience when I was at a B2C company and we had\
    \ a rigorous growth strategy. So that's where I entered into like, \u201COoh,\
    \ what's A/B testing? How can we effectively use data to drive our business decisions?\u201D\
    \ So, a few companies ago, I was really pressuring the product team, like, \u201C\
    Hey, maybe we can test this hypothesis out as an experiment? What kind of data\
    \ do we have at our disposal? How can we measure this?\u201D I remember the VP\
    \ of product at the time approached me and was like, \u201CI've never heard a\
    \ designer advocating for data, ever.\u201D She's like, \u201CI would be interested\
    \ in talking more. I think you would be a great PM. We should talk about it.\u201D\
    \ I didn't make the transition back then. But it ended up working out. I ended\
    \ up making the transition further down the road. So yeah, that's what kind of\
    \ led me into it."
  sec: 1104
  time: '18:24'
  who: Sara
- header: Data PMs vs regular PMs
- line: Why data PM specifically? Or it just happened?
  sec: 1178
  time: '19:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: "There is a reason. Throughout my career in product, I spent a lot of time\
    \ talking to various people in different fields, industries, roles \u2013 from\
    \ different backgrounds. And I often ask the question, \u201CHow do you go about\
    \ making decisions?\u201D Every answer is a little bit different, but one thing\
    \ that they all have in common is data \u2013 every single one. The problem I've\
    \ found is that most people who work outside of data teams generally don't have\
    \ access to know-how, or have the know-how to leverage that data. Oftentimes,\
    \ they're struggling to meet their objectives while not having effective ways\
    \ to measure the success of their projects. That then leads to a multitude of\
    \ problems down the road. Either they're working on the wrong thing, or maybe\
    \ they're underdelivering on something that they should be focusing on a little\
    \ bit more."
  sec: 1184
  time: '19:44'
  who: Sara
- line: "I wanted to learn a lot more around how data teams operate and how they can\
    \ take, oftentimes abstract, requirements from all over the business, synthesize\
    \ the data and make it actionable. To me, that was super interesting. Especially\
    \ the last company that I worked for, which was an HR data platform \u2013 a lot\
    \ of HR professionals are working with massive amounts of PII. So understanding\
    \ the compliance implications around that involves asking \u201CHow do you store\
    \ that data? How do you make sure that it's secure? How do you make sure that\
    \ the data that you're receiving in your HRS tool is correct?\u201D Because a\
    \ lot of times, there's a lot of various different sources of data that are coming\
    \ in and you have to rely on humans as part of that data entry. So how do you\
    \ make sure that the data that you're receiving \u2013 that you're using to interface\
    \ with your employees \u2013 is correct? That\u2019s what kind of led me into\
    \ my interest in data."
  sec: 1184
  time: '19:44'
  who: Sara
- line: "Maybe it's a gross oversimplification, but from what I understood \u2013\
    \ a data product manager is a product manager that works with data teams or works\
    \ inside a data team. This is correct, right?"
  sec: 1307
  time: '21:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 1321
  time: '22:01'
  who: Sara
- line: "Are there any other differences between a more traditional Product Manager\
    \ and a Data Product Manager? Apart from things that you mentioned \u2013 that\
    \ you need to know what PII stands for and that you need to think about data quality\
    \ and other data things?"
  sec: 1322
  time: '22:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I'm relatively early in my career, so I'm still figuring that out. I also\
    \ feel like there are a couple different interpretations that I've read about\
    \ as to what a Data PM is. I've heard some people say that it's part data analysis\
    \ \u2013 you are also an analyst as part of your role. I've heard that sometimes\
    \ you're a data scientist as well. So, to answer that question, I'm not sure how\
    \ to answer it, honestly. I'm still in the initial phase of learning how to be\
    \ a decent Data PM."
  sec: 1341
  time: '22:21'
  who: Sara
- line: You said that you need to be a bit of a data analyst. Do you need to know
    things like SQL and to be able to go fetch the data you need, and build some dashboards?
    Or you still rely on somebody else to do that?
  sec: 1380
  time: '23:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I guess it really depends on the makeup of your team. But I would say that\
    \ it would be a pretty hard requirement. [laughs] You need to know how to get\
    \ the data and to check the work and make sure that whatever output you're getting\
    \ is what you expected. I did quite a bit of learning. I learned SQL. I took a\
    \ few courses in data engineering \u2013 I took some data camp courses to kind\
    \ of understand some of the fundamentals. I think all of that is super important\
    \ \u2013 to develop an understanding and to build some context around the tools\
    \ that you're building."
  sec: 1394
  time: '23:14'
  who: Sara
- line: So, SQL and also bit of coding, I guess. You said you were taking some courses
    about data engineering. For that, you probably also need to know some Python or
    something else, right?
  sec: 1435
  time: '23:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have not learned Python yet.
  sec: 1450
  time: '24:10'
  who: Sara
- line: So you were just watching these courses to understand what problems data engineers
    have to deal with? Right?
  sec: 1452
  time: '24:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yep.
  sec: 1459
  time: '24:19'
  who: Sara
- line: That's interesting. But SQL would be something that you use quite often, right?
  sec: 1460
  time: '24:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I use it quite a bit.
  sec: 1466

  who: Sara
- header: Skill requirements for Data PMs
- line: "We have a question from Virginia. \u201CWhat skills should you have to become\
    \ a data product manager?\u201D You mentioned one of them is SQL. What are some\

    \ lot of data teams spend a lot of time educating various cross-functional teams\
    \ on how to leverage data. In a lot of discussions that I've had, specifically\
    \ with data engineers, I feel like they operate in isolation at a lot of companies.\
    \ I'm starting to see that a lot of teams are integrating data into their product\
    \ teams. But for a really long time, from what I've seen, a lot of data teams\
    \ are in service of product, in service of marketing, in services of business\

    \ there was a lot of whack-a-mole in their role. I guess it was interesting to\
    \ me to understand that largely, even though there are a lot of teams that heavily\
    \ rely on data, how little professionals in various fields truly understand it.\
    \ Also how much work goes into educating those different business partners on\

    \ we go into all the points that I had explained before, like their responsibilities,\
    \ problems that they to solve, etc. Because our product is real-time data, we\
    \ talk a little bit about CDC and the applications within their current data stack,\
    \ if applicable. So we'll lean in on that a little bit. But we document everything.\
    \ Everything is recorded for note-taking purposes. Then we go through the process\

    the customers? Are they coming from the engineers? Are they coming from everywhere?
  sec: 3531
  time: '58:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Gotcha. It's a culmination of all those things. Obviously, we have a company
    and business and product strategies that we're running. A lot of the opportunities
    that we go after are things that we prioritized, which engineering and product
    leadership have defined for the team. Then someone like me, who's an individual
    contributor, we take that and go through the motions of validating whether or
    not it's the problem to be solved.
  sec: 3543

- line: "We do all the research and then come back to the team and say, \u201CHey.\
    \ These are my findings. We still think this is worth going after.\u201D A lot\
    \ of the idea generation is coming from engineering leadership, at least right\
    \ now. But that doesn't necessarily mean that a feature idea purely comes from\
    \ them, because through our research and building an understanding of problem\
    \ space, that might change how we approach a feature or whatever we end up releasing\
    \ at the end of the day."
  sec: 3543
  time: '59:03'
  who: Sara
- line: So if the engineering leadership comes up with an idea, it doesn't mean you
    immediately run and implement it. It first goes through the validation stage and
    you actually ask the customers to get some feedback from them. So that's the process.
    I guess you just have some sort of backlog with ideas and you try to prioritize
    that backlog. Then you pick the most promising ones and go through this process.

    machine learning and data science stuff or mostly about analytics and data engineering
    stuff?
