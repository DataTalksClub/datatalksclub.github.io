title: Make an Impact Through Volunteering Open Source Work
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about volunteering and open source work. We have a special
    guest today, Sara. Sara is a Google Developer expert in machine learning, a Google
    PhD fellow, and also a co-founder of AI Wonder Girls. She likes to demystify AI
    to empower individuals with tools and mindsets that require building solutions
    that matter to the community and humanity.
  sec: 103
  time: '1:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: We met with Sara in October, I think, at a conference in Porto. It was an
    amazing conference. We had a very nice chat. Sara was talking about what she does
    and I thought “She would be an amazing guest.” And here we are 3, 4, 5 months
    after that, finally. [chuckles] So, welcome to the interview.
  sec: 103
  time: '1:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you.
  sec: 154
  time: '2:34'
  who: Sara
- header: Sara’s background
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. As always,
    thanks, Johanna, for your help. Before we start – before we go into our main topic
    of open source work and volunteering – let's start with your background. Can you
    tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 157
  time: '2:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. I got interested in AI in my first engineering year, back in 2016.
    We were part of an interesting journey called “Beyond Engineering” (educational
    engineering) where we had to contribute our engineering skills to help the locals.
    And that's actually what pushed me to start going this volunteering road, because
    I enjoyed it so much – giving back to the community and my skills that I wanted
    to do it as well. But from there, I started learning about what AI is. And obviously,
    like everyone, I started with Andrew Ng’s course, Machine Learning from Stanford.
  sec: 176
  time: '2:56'
  who: Sara
- line: That's how, after that, I got into [inaudible] deep learning [inaudible],
    so on and so forth. On the side, I was volunteering my skills with Omdena AI,
    and then got an interesting internship from STEM-Away. That's how I actually got
    to where I am now [chuckles] doing my PhD in AI applied to help. One of the reasons
    why I actually wanted to do a PhD was to get deep learning research –applied research
    in industry. Obviously, if you're going to be doing research, you do need some
    kind of research intensive – that's a PhD for you. [chuckles]
  sec: 176
  time: '2:56'
  who: Sara
- line: And what is your background? What were your studies about?
  sec: 263
  time: '4:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Actually, in our engineering, we were doing computer science. Our major
    was called Computer Science and Emerging Technologies Engineering. In our last
    year, I did a Big Data Engineering specialization.
  sec: 266
  time: '4:26'
  who: Sara
- line: And then you liked it and you wanted to do more AI [Sara agrees] and this
    was a way…
  sec: 284
  time: '4:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, in that same year (in 2017) I was interested… I was actually part of
    a Big Data Challenge for EEE. When we did that internship, I was like, “I really
    want to do this.” I was enamored by computer vision because I'm a vision person,
    most of the time. That's how I got interested in computer vision, and then from
    computer vision, I was really interested in the medical field. I watch a lot of
    medical dramas. That's how I wanted to do AI Applied to help in mind.
  sec: 288
  time: '4:48'
  who: Sara
- line: Grey's Anatomy?
  sec: 329
  time: '5:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, I kind of watched that, but that wasn't my first choice. I usually prefer
    [inaudible] when it comes to doctor dramas because they're more thorough.
  sec: 332
  time: '5:32'
  who: Sara
- line: Yeah, I also know Scrubs, but I guess it's also not really a very medical
    show, right? [Sara agrees] [chuckles] Okay, so your focus is on AI and healthcare,
    right? [Sara agrees] So what is your PhD about?
  sec: 346
  time: '5:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's about deep multi-modality learning for COVID-19 and IDT diagnosis. Practically,
    I am trying a bunch of CNM models and vision transformers. I mix and match, depending
    on the disease, different modalities. For example, for COVID, chest X-ray with
    CT – I feed them to the CNMs or the models I'm comparing to do a benchmark and
    see which models outperforms and which models for example… Which modality is actually
    much more efficient to our searching model than another? Why? And is it normal?
    For example, is it what doctors usually rely upon more than the other modality
    available on the modalities? That's practically, in simple words, what I'm doing.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Sara
- line: How long have you been doing this?
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, this is like my fourth year. This is my final year. I'm just wrapping
    up the writing part.
  sec: 418
  time: '6:58'
  who: Sara
- line: Final year, okay. So now you're almost finished? Right?
  sec: 425
  time: '7:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. No, no, I'm finished. I haven't done any experimentation for almost a
    year. Yeah.
  sec: 431
  time: '7:11'
  who: Sara
- line: So you've been writing papers for a year?
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it’s more like I have been writing papers from the start of my PhD. My
    first paper was ready by… I believe it was November or something. It was ready,
    as it was circulating around journals. Because, by the way, the paper that was
    published just recently, just last year and this was the first paper that was
    written, all the other papers that have already been published, but it was still
    roaming around.
  sec: 443
  time: '7:23'
  who: Sara
- header: On being a Google PhD fellow
- line: Ah, so it took a bit of time. [Sara agrees] You're also a Google PhD fellow.
    [Sara agrees] What does that mean and how did you get it?
  sec: 473
  time: '7:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Actually, one of the things we don't have in Morocco, sadly, for now
    – we don't have funding for research. One of the things I had to do was find a
    funding source – a scholarship or something to help me support my studies. Way
    before that, I was involved in a lot of Google stuff, like with the GDG (Google
    Developers Groups). I knew they had a program called Google PhD Fellowship. I
    applied to it. I… What can I tell you? The thing is, if you want to apply for
    aid and you want to have a chance to be selected, please make sure that you focus
    on something they care about. For example, try to figure out what they're researching,
    especially, for example, a searching field – if you're doing it for healthcare.
    Figure out what they're interested in. Then the second thing is, it has to touch
    upon a SDG goal, like helping you or your community. And it has to help your community.
  sec: 482
  time: '8:02'
  who: Sara
- line: That means if you're in Morocco, or if you're in a certain region, it has
    to help your region do something – it's going to be useful if people leverage
    that research or something. I think that's why I got it, but I believe strongly
    that most of the reasons why I really got it was not just around the proposal,
    but also, obviously, my supervisor. And the second thing is all of the works I
    have already done way before applying to it. I have done a lot of volunteer work;
    I have touched a lot – I've been [involved with] all kinds of different AI and
    applied it to different domains. So I think that's one of the reasons why I got
    it. So what is it all about? Usually, in the fellowship – you can think of it
    like a scholarship because it kind of is like a scholarship. They give you money,
    right? For example $10,000 per year. By the way, they increased that – now it's
    $12,000. But usually it’s $10,000 a year for three years, depending on the region.
  sec: 482
  time: '8:02'
  who: Sara
- line: For example, Africa, this is what we have. I believe in the US, they only
    give them for one year, because usually they do have funding. What do they give
    you on top of the money, is they also give you a Google mentor and it's up to
    you to leverage this mentor or not. I am a very independent person. [chuckles]
    So I did almost everything by myself. Sometimes, when we had our meetings, I was
    like, “What do you think of my proposal?” “Is it relevant or not?” And then he
    would be like, “Yeah, it's interesting. You can go ahead with it.” That's practically
    much of our meeting. [chuckles] That's what I do in our meeting. Well, apart from
    that, there is the PhD Fellowship Summit that I invite you to – it's a virtual
    Summit, where obviously, there are all of the Google PhD fellows gathered together.
    Then Googlers talk about what they're doing in Google, in the research aspect
    – obviously, about AI.
  sec: 482
  time: '8:02'
  who: Sara
- header: Sara’s volunteer work
- line: Interesting. You mentioned that one of the reasons you got this was the cause,
    and that it was helping the local community. [Sara agrees] Not only that, but
    also, because of all the previous work you had done – all the volunteering work,
    and that you applied the AI to a lot of things. Can you maybe tell us more about
    that? What kind of volunteering work have you done?
  sec: 668
  time: '11:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: My first volunteering work was with Omdena – it was around the detection of
    post-traumatic stress disorder. In that project, we kind of, as always… I'm not
    sure if you know this, but in AI, most of the time, we have the problem with data
    – we have the problem of computational resources. We didn't have the data at the
    time. We kind of had to get creative regarding where we got it from. We were a
    bunch of AI engineers collaborating together to help figure out from certain discussions
    if a person had PTSD or not. We developed a chatbot for that.
  sec: 698
  time: '11:38'
  who: Sara
- line: For example, if we believed that that person had post traumatic stress disorder,
    we suggested resources based on DSM-5 and CAPS-5 (these are standard psychiatric
    guidelines that we referred to). Obviously, most of the time, we always refer
    them to the doctor, because with AI, you can never trust it.  This is one of the
    points. Apart from that, from then on, I started volunteering with Omdena more.
    I actually volunteered with their second project about trash out, which was about
    detecting if a certain trash is recyclable or not, using computer vision. For
    example, you have some kind of trash, and then you figure out if it's recyclable
    or not. Because every region in the world has its own regulations, on top of figuring
    out if it was recyclable or not, we had to figure it out… It depends on what type
    of actual trash it is, depending on the region. That was my second project with
    Omdena.
  sec: 698
  time: '11:38'
  who: Sara
- line: My third project was with Fruit Punch AI, and it was around detecting our
    cervicals. In our spine, we have curved because seven cervicals and we had to
    segment those. What they wanted us to do was to segment these cervicals so that
    they could actually plot a searching function where they… They tried to know if
    this movement that I'm doing right now is normal. If it is a normal movement.
  sec: 698
  time: '11:38'
  who: Sara
- line: In the neck only, right?
  sec: 848
  time: '14:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Yes. They were trying to figure out if… For example, when someone had
    surgery to replace one of these cervicals, was the movement still the same as
    it is in normal settings? Because, what happened was that, when they replaced
    one of these cervicals, the “meat” kind of sticks to the new cervicals, and the
    neck doesn't move as normally as it could. So they wanted to know what the difference
    was? What was the factor that was helping us do all of this movement, and figuring
    out a solution for that.
  sec: 849
  time: '14:09'
  who: Sara
- line: That was my third project. Then like all the other projects that came after
    that were related to my internship, where I started to do it… It was an online
    internship – this was my first online internship ever [chuckles] with STEM-Away.
    Actually, we had to figure out what type of topic a certain post can go to. So
    when you have a couple of forums like, for example, Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange
    – you have people discussing a lot of topics. So, for example, you might have
    someone saying a certain discussion and you might want to classify which topic
    this might be for. For example, if it’s AI, is it computer vision, is it using
    deep learning, or something like that? So that was what the internship was about.
    I started being a mentor from an intern – from a project lead to a mentor in that
    setting, and then creating content for people to learn AI.
  sec: 849
  time: '14:09'
  who: Sara
- line: That's amazing, so many… Going back to this Omdena – the first project was
    about detecting PTSD and you implemented a chatbot for that, right? [Sara agrees]
    I imagine… Where can you even get the data about that?
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, so we got it from… Someone  in the university had a friend in the military,
    and they contacted them, and they said we could use that data. At that time, if
    I remember correctly, IBM was interested in developing chatbots for military people.
    Because, mostly, they are the ones who suffer most from PTSD. I mean, they go
    through traumatic events almost every day. So they were interested in developing
    a machine learning model and that's why the data was available. So we can say
    we struck luck. But, for example, for the Trash Out, what we did was… We already
    had some data. But, obviously, if you're doing segmentation, you need more data
    [chuckles] than, for example, just a couple… 100 is not enough, right?
  sec: 965
  time: '16:05'
  who: Sara
- line: What we did was leverage open images – there's a huge [cache] of Google open
    source open images. What we did was pick the trash from that. We picked trash
    from Google images. We kind of had to get creative around how to collect data.
    This is what happens in every volunteering challenge I have entered. Normally,
    this happens with people who… Even businesses that can't afford to buy data –
    they get their own data from somewhere. So you have to get creative around where
    you can find that data. In research, this happens a lot, especially if you don't
    have funding. It's hard to find data.
  sec: 965
  time: '16:05'
  who: Sara
- header: Finding AI volunteer work
- line: How did you actually come across this project from Omdena? How did you find
    this PTSD project (the first one)?
  sec: 1061
  time: '17:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a good question. From my LinkedIn. [chuckles] When I was back in my
    first year, the one where I discovered that I was interested in AI, the whole
    time, I was complaining about opportunity. When I got into AI, I was really… I
    knew I needed to get a PhD or a Master’s, so I can further my studies and develop
    the skills. Because what we had in Morocco was still kind of… We didn't have experts.
    We had only a few people who actually knew about AI and mastered it. So I needed
    to get more expertise, and I wanted to go abroad. One of the things I was always
    complaining about was, “Why do we not have opportunities to further our studies
    and get funding and scholarships, and all of that?” So what I developed was a
    kind of reflex of searching for opportunities.
  sec: 1068
  time: '17:48'
  who: Sara
- line: Right now, I use my Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn just for opportunities
    hunting. Whenever I see someone posting something interesting – that's why I actually
    send a lot of LinkedIn requests. I have people from all over the world with different
    opportunities that they post from time to time. You can think of it like a task
    or habit now – I scroll everyday through all of my LinkedIn feed (or Facebook
    feed) for an opportunity. Although now I kind of know where the treasure trove
    is, thanks to the mailing lists. [chuckles] So it's easier to get opportunities.
    But before, that's how I actually got across LinkedIn, by… Actually the Omdena
    thing by Rudradeb (his name is a bit difficult to pronounce). He is the founder
    of Omdena. He was posting about his… I believe it was their second challenge,
    where they were detecting rooftops. That's how I learned about Omdena, and I was
    like, “Yeah, sure. It will be interesting to use my skills and help in that way.”
    And that's how I came across the PTSD challenge.
  sec: 1068
  time: '17:48'
  who: Sara
- line: Okay. So, social media, right? You follow relevant…
  sec: 1197
  time: '19:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: People. Interesting people.
  sec: 1202
  time: '20:02'
  who: Sara
- line: Yes. And they post relevant stuff and you follow on that – you connect with
    them and you ask, “Hey, I want to take part.” Right? [Sara agrees] That's cool.
    But can’t… Sometimes, for me, when I open LinkedIn, it can be a bit overwhelming.
  sec: 1205
  time: '20:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it is. That's why you kind of need to be very specific around who you
    follow. You need to be mindful… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1225
  time: '20:25'
  who: Sara
- line: And what you like, right?
  sec: 1237
  time: '20:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. And you need to be mindful of how much time you're spending. For example,
    for me… Actually, to be honest, I developed the bad habit of scrolling. Not just
    scrolling, for example, sometimes I'm just holding my phone. I'm always doing
    this [shows thumb scrolling motion]. Scrolling, right? One time, I was reading
    a book – this was around during startup. I was on a train, and I wanted to move
    to the next page. So instead of turning the page… [chuckles]
  sec: 1238
  time: '20:38'
  who: Sara
- line: It didn’t work, right? [chuckles]
  sec: 1274
  time: '21:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, you know – it's a bad habit. Right now, what I'm doing is cutting off
    all social media from my phone. But I check them out on my laptop. Usually, my
    laptop is only for work. So if I do it, I do it only for five to ten minutes,
    and then go out to do my work. [chuckles]
  sec: 1275
  time: '21:15'
  who: Sara
- line: I guess if you like these posts about relevant opportunities, then LinkedIn
    will surface suggestions next time you open it.
  sec: 1296
  time: '21:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, suggestions and recommendations. Sure. Yeah. By the way, Facebook is
    a great place to find opportunities as well. But please, don't follow irrelevant
    people and think that you will get anything interesting from that. Try to see
    where, for example, it's about specifically the topic you’re interested in. For
    example, for me, I'm interested in computer vision – let's say in health care
    for now, I will only join Facebook groups that talk about that specifically. And
    I will make sure that it's not a Facebook group that is full of irrelevant posts.
    Sometimes it can be about a topic, but it has nothing to do with what they're
    posting about.
  sec: 1304
  time: '21:44'
  who: Sara
- line: I noticed that what Twitter recently started doing is – in addition to people
    who I follow, they also started mixing in popular content. [Sara agrees] Which
    is things like puppy videos, or things from movies or quotes or whatever.
  sec: 1349
  time: '22:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: And ads – lots of ads.
  sec: 1368
  time: '22:48'
  who: Sara
- line: And ads, yeah.
  sec: 1370
  time: '22:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: But, I mean, everyone is trying to rip some money off people. That's why,
    I guess, they're being like that.
  sec: 1373
  time: '22:53'
  who: Sara
- line: I mean, ads, I understand. Ads are sometimes relevant, right? If the algorithm
    is good, then they show relevant ads. Okay. I don't mind that. But puppy videos?
    It’s like they just want to get me to stay on the platform. Who doesn't like puppies,
    right?
  sec: 1381
  time: '23:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [chuckles] Just be careful how much time you spend there. Twitter is
    a great place if you're a researcher because most researchers hang out there.
    That their fabulous place – at least it used to be.
  sec: 1399
  time: '23:19'
  who: Sara
- line: Well, I remember Yann LeCun once wrote, “I'm leaving Twitter. I'll never come
    back.”
  sec: 1415
  time: '23:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, yes. It was the mastodon era.
  sec: 1421
  time: '23:41'
  who: Sara
- header: Sara’s Fruit Punch challenge
- line: Yeah, but he's still there. Right? [chuckles] Okay. So this is how you found
    these opportunities – through social media. So you found Omdena, then you took
    part in another challenge with Omdena, and then there was this FruitPunch.AI,
    which is a similar platform, right? Or what was that?
  sec: 1424
  time: '23:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it's just that the setting is a little bit different. For example, Omdena
    gathers all of us AI engineers together and leaves… We do have meetings, but it
    leaves the freedom for us to work on what we want, or what is relevant to what
    we want to achieve. But for Fruit Punch AI, it's more structured. For example,
    they have a team for every task – they're the ones describing the task very specifically
    and then if you want to join a specific task, it's already a task there. You don't
    have to come up with the task yourself.
  sec: 1448
  time: '24:08'
  who: Sara
- line: So Omdena just gives you a general problem [Sara agrees] and then it's up
    to you how exactly to approach this and what kind of tasks you have. While at
    Fruit Punch AI, it's more structured like you would have at work. Somebody could
    be a sort of “product manager” or a business person who translates the requirements.
  sec: 1490
  time: '24:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, they are the ones who do that. They are the ones who translate the requirements
    – they define the problem into actual specific tasks. At Omdena, they tell you,
    “Here's a problem. Here are parts of the problem that we want to solve. Here are
    our objectives.” But in terms of who is going to do what, what the specific tasks
    are, and everything like that, it's up to the AI engineers to figure it out. But
    then I think it's because of the public.
  sec: 1519
  time: '25:19'
  who: Sara
- line: Fruit Punch AI, they really target people who are still beginners, but for
    Omdena, they target people who are already advanced. You have to have done at
    least two to three projects in AI in order to be able to really navigate the challenge.
    Because it's really hard when you have a lot of experts around you and you're
    intimidated to do anything if you're not familiar with AI.
  sec: 1519
  time: '25:19'
  who: Sara
- line: Does that mean that if I'm a beginner, I cannot take part in Omdena challenges?
  sec: 1580
  time: '26:20'
  who: Alexey
- header: How to take part in AI challenges
- line: You can! That's the thing, you can. They won't block you. [chuckles] It’s
    just that it’s going to be very overwhelming. But people usually are very nice.
    If you're not shy, and if you ask for help, everyone will most surely help. People
    are really nice – everyone is willing to help and ready to help.
  sec: 1585
  time: '26:25'
  who: Sara
- line: Okay. Let's say I want to join a challenge – a similar challenge from Omdena,
    from Fruit Punch AI, from something else, from some other company.
  sec: 1604
  time: '26:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Join us! [chuckles]
  sec: 1617

- line: We're a group of ladies interested in AI, from different walks of life. There
    are people who are tech and people who are business-related. We get together and
    we find a challenge that's interesting for us –a hackathon, competition, you name
    it. We get together and then work on it. That's it!
  sec: 1622

  who: Sara

  sec: 1645
  time: '27:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Well, right now, I'm not sure if any of us… Because we have a bunch…
    The name is the same but we have different teams. Any team can – you get at least
    five ladies together, or three, and then we should do something interesting. There
    are people who are interested in health care, like me. [chuckles] Most of them,
    there's something related to health care. I share the link in our WhatsApp group
    and I'm like, “Ladies are you in? Who's in?” And then we get together, we pump
    up our first meeting, figure out what they want from us – from a challenge or
    the hackathon.
  sec: 1647
  time: '27:27'
  who: Sara
- line: Obviously, one of the things we really care about is judging criteria. We
    figure that out first. Then we figure out what they are interested in us helping
    them solve. Then we brainstorm together, we come up with a couple ideas to explore,
    we gather data around it. Is it feasible? If it's feasible, we move on and then
    we start coding. If it's not, then, obviously, we move on to the next idea until
    we find what we're looking for. We have won a couple of challenges. Actually,
    from the day we started, we kept winning until now – sometimes we don't win. [chuckles]
  sec: 1647
  time: '27:27'
  who: Sara
- line: I have so many questions about winning and challenges. But I want to take
    a step back.
  sec: 1730
  time: '28:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Go ahead. Go ahead.
  sec: 1734
  time: '28:54'
  who: Sara
- line: Yeah. So the way it works, as I understood it – there is already a community,
    this WhatsApp group of ladies, who are interested in AI and doing something with
    this. There is already a community and there is not necessarily a problem that
    you want to solve yet. Right? Then somebody (it could be you or could be somebody
    else) says, “Let's work on this problem.” And then they reply, “Yeah, let's work!”
    And then you start analyzing this problem, start checking if it's even possible
    (if it's feasible to solve it). Is there data?
  sec: 1739
  time: '28:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Then you go through this process and you understand, “Okay, this is feasible.
    This is possible. The data is there. Let's work on that.” And then you spend a
    bit of time (a few weeks, let’s say) working on that. There’s also an objective,
    I guess. Once you understand, “Okay, we reached the objective,” or maybe, “We
    did not reach the objective because of (reasons).” Then you finish the project
    and then the process restarts.
  sec: 1739
  time: '28:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: You submit. And then it goes up once again.
  sec: 1800
  time: '30:00'
  who: Sara
- line: Submit where?
  sec: 1804
  time: '30:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, if it's a hackathon, usually you'll be submitting your solution
    to the hackathon. If you check out the post, they have a couple of hackathons.
    We choose one. One of the things that we're very specific about is that the challenge
    has to at least touch one SDG goal. It has to have an impact. That's why we are
    all there. We're interested in impact – in using our AI skills for impact. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1807
  time: '30:07'
  who: Sara
- line: So the way I understood it (and it's probably what you’re saying) is that
    you always come up with problems yourself. But you also mentioned hackathons.
    I guess the same communities, the same WhatsApp group, where somebody could say,
    “Okay, I came across this hackathon. Let's take part.” Right?
  sec: 1836
  time: '30:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Yes.
  sec: 1855
  time: '30:55'

  sec: 1856

  sec: 1864
  time: '31:04'
  who: Sara
- header: Hackathons
- line: Can you tell us about one of the hackathons?
  sec: 1868
  time: '31:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For example, our first hackathon was around medical imaging. It was
    from Microsoft and Stratica. Actually, that was the first one that started everything.
    Previously, I really wanted to be part of hackathons. I was amazed by people who
    got together and came up with a solution and then won something by the end of
    it [chuckles]. I really wanted to do it. I tried it before – it didn't work. But
    this time, I was like, “This is really a cool hackathon. We have a bunch of ladies
    gathered together interested in AI.” So I said, “Let's try my luck.” I copy/pasted
    the link into the WhatsApp group, and I was like, “Ladies, there's a really super
    cool hackathon. Would you be interested, by the way, in taking part in it?” That's
    how 8 ladies got interested. They reached out and said, “Let's do this.”
  sec: 1871
  time: '31:11'
  who: Sara
- line: We created our own Discord, created our own channel, and started exchanging
    ideas around how we could participate and what we could offer. We based it, obviously,
    on the description and the judging criteria. Usually, in these hackathons, especially
    if it's from a reputable source, they have mentors. They always provide you with
    mentors. Because this was around medical communication, they did provide doctors.
    So we had a meeting with a doctor and we understood their needs. He told us, “We
    already have AI tools, but we would like it if the AI notified when it was finished
    its task.” For example, if it was going over a chest X ray, going over a radio
    and a modality and then notified them about it. Obviously, it should help them
    actually write the report.
  sec: 1871
  time: '31:11'
  who: Sara
- line: One of the issues that usually… It’s not an issue, but one of the things that
    makes it so difficult to do their job is that – if you remember, in the time of
    COVID, they had a lot of people coming in. Because almost everyone was touched
    by it, right? So they were overwhelmed in the radiology section. A radiologist
    normally has only eight minutes to read the scan and then do the report. So what
    they wanted us to do was to expedite this part – to actually have the AI come
    up with the report, and then the radiologist can actually go over the report and
    fix it, if possible. So that was kind of the final solution that it was about.
    That’s it – we figure out what the mentors want from us, we review our idea with
    them, and then keep refining it. Obviously, when you have a couple of engineers
    put together, most of the time, the solution only comes near the end of the hackathon.
    [chuckles] You know how we love to work at the last minute. So that's kind of
    how we usually do it.
  sec: 1871
  time: '31:11'
  who: Sara
- line: The whole month where there are sometimes meetings and sometimes talking about
    the solution, and then in the last week, we’re all rushing and putting it in front
    of us to be able to deliver the solution we agreed on. Most of the time, we kind
    of tried to deliver as much as we could. That means, for example, for the medical
    imaging, we did not only take the red radiology detected (it was about hand fracture)
    – does the patient have a hand fracture or not? Delivered the report, we also
    provided a dashboard so they could see all the cases that were coming in and all
    the details that you can find in a DICOM file. That would be things like gender,
    demographics – anything you can think of.
  sec: 1871
  time: '31:11'
  who: Sara
- line: And then we provided what we call “future work”. That is things like improving
    the platform, the UI of the platform, the visuals and the delivery, and then sending
    the message over to their phones, tablets, whatever they have their hands on.
    In almost all of our hackathons or the challenges we work on, we never provide
    just one solution. That's actually the power of numbers, because most of the time,
    we're 5-8 people. We have the luxury of having everyone focus on an aspect that
    could be added. So we don't work on one solution – we work on several solutions
    in one package. That's the reason why we win. [chuckles] Obviously, we respect
    the judging criteria and a lot of other stuff.
  sec: 1871
  time: '31:11'
  who: Sara
- line: Do I understand correctly…? There's actually a question that reads, “What's
    the key to winning a hackathon?” So let me try to summarize what you said and
    then maybe we will add more. First of all, you have a mentor, and you need to
    get the most from this mentor to really understand what they want from you. These
    people will tell you what kind of things you need to do. Right? [Sara agrees]
    So they will help you understand the criteria. They will help you to understand
    what exactly you need to give at the end.
  sec: 2158
  time: '35:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Wait. By the way, they won't tell you. You need to get it out of them. [chuckles]
  sec: 2192
  time: '36:32'
  who: Sara
- line: Yeah, yeah. Of course. So it's not like they just tell you “Oh, here. By the
    way, this is how you do this.” So you ask. You will tell us how to do this, but
    let me finish the summary. Then the second thing is, you don't focus on one single
    thing. Once you figure out, “Okay, this is the problem. This is the solution,”
    you then explore other solutions and you think, “Okay, there are two-three potential
    things we can do. How can we put them in one package – to form one solution from
    them?”
  sec: 2198
  time: '36:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: And then you split into subgroups and work on these sub-solutions and then
    present it as a whole thing. So that's the key to winning – understanding requirements,
    talking to your mentors, and presenting multiple solutions. Is there anything
    else? What else would you add?
  sec: 2198
  time: '36:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You can think of it like a business. In business, you obviously have
    clients, and you have an offer. Right? So one of the key criteria in business
    is to understand your client – to be able to provide them with the offer that
    is going to suit them, right? This is very similar in hackathons or challenges
    or anything you're doing. So you need to understand the judges. So what do the
    judges care about? You first need to know who they are, if it's possible. Otherwise,
    you need to read through the lines. What matters to these people? What is it that
    they are stressed about that you really want to get up? So this is the most crucial
    part. And you need to be very careful of the judging criteria. So what do they
    want? What are they going to be giving notes on? For example, if they care about
    inclusion – nice!
  sec: 2259
  time: '37:39'
  who: Sara
- line: In your presentation, make sure you leverage the fact that you're an amazing
    eight ladies from all over the world [chuckles] and working on AI. This is a winning
    point in one of the judging criteria, for example. So if they care about something
    specific – let's say they care about the environment – figure out a way to add
    environments to your solution. So figure out how to leverage what they're looking
    for, what they care about, as judges – as people – and then, as organizers of
    the hackathon. If you try to figure out what they want out of the hackathon, that's
    the best way to win – to understand what they want and deliver on it, as best
    you can. That's the winning criteria.
  sec: 2259
  time: '37:39'
  who: Sara
- header: Things people often miss in AI projects and hackathons
- line: That's smart. Is there something that most people miss? I guess if there is
    a list of criteria, then most people try to… “Okay, they care about the environment.
    Let's set something…” Is there something that most people miss?
  sec: 2370
  time: '39:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 2385
  time: '39:45'
  who: Sara
- line: You don't?
  sec: 2386
  time: '39:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, there is. There's one thing actually that we all miss. It's the fact that
    we say, “I can't do this.” So what I invite you to do is not to think about the
    fact that you can't do this, but think about what you can do with what you have.
    For example, let's say I want to build a model that detects if someone has hair
    loss or not through, for example, some kind of data from bio (not from images).
    It's difficult if you don't have the data. But what if you got creative around
    it? You really have to have that data? Isn't there some kind of other place where
    you can find similar data? Or you can… With LLMs right now, you can create your
    own data. Because what they're looking for is for you to show them that it's possible
    to be done. In a hackathon, they're not looking for the final solution.
  sec: 2387
  time: '39:47'
  who: Sara
- line: That's not possible. When you have one to two months, you can only come up
    with an MVP. Right? That's what you want to do. Focus on how you can build the
    MVP and don't think about, “I don't have the means.” For example, if you lack
    computational power, there is Goggle, there is Colab. Leverage the resources you
    have. Get creative around which you can build. This is one of the reasons why
    we usually fail in hackathons – people give up too early, because when they get
    into the solution, they're like, “Oh, my God! What did I get into? This is not
    possible to be done.” But that's not how you should approach it.
  sec: 2387
  time: '39:47'
  who: Sara
- line: So the state…
  sec: 2498
  time: '41:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: The mindset.
  sec: 2500
  time: '41:40'
  who: Sara
- line: Right. The mindset should be not, “It's not possible,” but “How can I do something
    that brings me closer?” Right? And then it could be just maybe taking a step back
    and then exploring other ways to do this. Instead of getting data, you generate
    the data, or as you said…
  sec: 2501
  time: '41:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Or get it from social media, research papers…
  sec: 2523
  time: '42:03'
  who: Sara

- line: So what if I'm the least creative person on Earth? How do I go about being
    creative when it comes to getting data?
  sec: 2527
  time: '42:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a cool question. Well, thanks to generative AI, you have ChatGPT, you
    have Gemini, you have all kinds of AIs to help you get creative. You can just
    go around and say, “I want to build this solution.” Just tell it everything you
    have as a problem. “There is no data. I have never worked on this before. I only
    have experience with basic machine learning models. How can I win this hackathon
    with the following judgment criteria?” Give it all the descriptions and let it
    run wild. The only thing you have to do is pick the solution that you feel most
    comfortable with.
  sec: 2535
  time: '42:15'
  who: Sara
- line: Yeah. So, basically just tell the Chatbot all you know about the problem.
  sec: 2577
  time: '42:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, sure. What do you want from it? This is just one way. If we didn't have
    AI, how can you do that? One of the best ways is… One of the things I forgot to
    talk about is your team. You need to pick the right people in your team. In your
    team, there is a need for someone to be creative. There is a need for someone
    to love doing things – someone who is going to build the actual solution. There
    is a need for someone who is a little bit technical – they don't have to 1000
    percent know how to do it, but they at least have to know how to do something.
    So your team is one of your assets. If you can't, or if you're not creative, but
    you want to get ideas – simple. There are a couple of ways you can do it.
  sec: 2589
  time: '43:09'
  who: Sara
- line: First things first. You can go to Reddit, figure out what people mainly complain
    about in that subject area. Here you go. Here's your idea. There's a lot of complaints.
    Just pick the one that you find the most relatable to the hackathon or challenge
    or research. If you're doing research, by the way, this is the same thing. Whatever
    project you want to start, even a startup, go do some market research. Try to
    understand what people are complaining about and leverage that to come up with
    a solution. This is one of them.
  sec: 2589
  time: '43:09'
  who: Sara
- line: Usually if you're in this field, related to it, you might want to start reading
    research papers on a weekly basis, or at least follow people who do so. For example,
    I'm necessarily a huge fan of reading typical research papers. I only love reviews
    – thorough reviews – but I don't usually read the normal papers. But I do follow
    a lot of people who read papers. Practically all researchers I'm interested in,
    I follow them. There are enthusiasts – people who are interested in researching
    specific topics and they share about it. So the only thing I have to do is scroll
    through my feed and here I am. I know practically everything that there is to
    know about the latest stuff happening. [chuckles]

  sec: 2759
  time: '45:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's good. Let’s take fake news. The only thing I'm gonna do is go to Google
    Scholar and type “NLP, fake news”. Then I will get a couple of papers, suggestions,
    and based on your preferences, you can rank by date. Then you can check out their
    papers. Someone you like – their papers you like – try to figure out if they are
    on Twitter. If they're not on Twitter, try to figure out if they're on LinkedIn.
    So try to figure out the people that you’d like to subscribe to and just follow
    them.

    click on “follow,” please make sure that you check out all of their feeds to be
    sure that it aligns with your values. Otherwise, you might get some very bad,
    expected stuff.'

  who: Alexey
- line: If you don't have the budget, for example, to attend a conference (because
    sometimes it's expensive) what you can do is go to the conference you like, and
    then see the speakers list. Usually they provide the program for free – you can
    just check it out and see the talk that you like. By the way, try your chance,
    copy/paste the title and their name and see if the talk has been recorded – if
    it's on YouTube, or if it's even shared on social media. Or just Google it and
    see if it's shared. Obviously, watch it, see if you like it. If you like it, then
    follow that person. Otherwise, move on. I mean, just research. Use your creativity.

    projects?”
  sec: 2922
  time: '48:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Like, what…? Oh, yeah. Sure. Let's say, for example, there's an Omdena challenge.
    They have a lot of challenges, by the way, and you can check them out. In different
    areas, and they touch different SDG goals. Let's say you like the challenge. One
    of the first things we do is read about the challenge. Just know what it is, what
    you're going to do and how comfortable you're going to be with it. You can think
    of it like applying to a job. Usually, when you're applying to a job, you need
    to figure out what they want from you and you need to adapt your CV to that.
  sec: 2932
  time: '48:52'
  who: Sara
- line: I don't think they asked for a CV, but they will be doing an interview. When
    they're doing an interview, think of it like… you don't need to think of it like
    a job interview, so be very relaxed. It's just volunteering, they're not going
    to pay you. This helps to calm the nerves when you know they're not paying you.
    [chuckles] So just pitch yourself. Just tell them… Let's say, for example, it
    was around PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). I was never a psychologist or
    anything like that. But I'm a huge fan of the medical field. And I'm a huge fan
    of human behavior in general. So when they asked me why I wanted to join, I just
    talked about my passion. I just kept mumbling, “Here is why.” Just be direct.
    When you're talking, try to showcase how relevant your skills are to what you're
    applying for.
  sec: 2932
  time: '48:52'
  who: Sara
- line: For example, if you have done NLP before, even though it's not in healthcare,
    you can mention that. What they want to see is just the fact that you have already
    done this. They don't want you to get into the challenge and then stay stuck.
    Because you will see a lot of people rocking it and going hard on the tasks, but
    when you’re coming up with a solution and you're stuck and looking at them, not
    doing anything. They want to make sure that you at least have the basics to be
    able to navigate around the river.

- header: Why it’s worth doing volunteer projects
- line: I’m wondering, what do you actually get from participating in these projects?
    It's not paid, so you're getting some experience, I assume. What’s in it for you?
    Why do you take part? Why would I want to take part? What do you think?
  sec: 3059
  time: '50:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. I will be talking about impact and then practical. Let's start with
    practical. When you're trying to search for an internship and they tell you they
    are doing X or Y, they will be giving you specific tasks to do, right? When you
    get in, they don't give you that. They give you something completely unrelated
    most of the time, or at least they will give you something that is similar, but
    it's not really what you signed up for. With volunteering, you get to choose what
    you want to apply to. Actually what they tell you is going to be done is 100%
    what is going to be done (and a little bit more). You're going touch that and
    then touch a couple more other things that you might be excited about for growth.
    This is one.

  who: Sara
- line: In internships, I'm not sure if it's this case everywhere around the world,
    but some of them are paid – most of them are not. You don't get paid either way.
    [chuckles] For internships with an organization, what they usually end up giving
    you is a statement that you did indeed intern with them. That is also the case
    with Omdena or Fruit Punch or any kind of other volunteer platform – they will
    give you a certificate saying that you actually did participate in the challenge
    or volunteer work or whatever. Let's now talk about employment. Usually, in employment,
    one of the things that will be required from you, apart from the certificate,
    for example, is people they can talk to.
  sec: 3081
  time: '51:21'
  who: Sara
- line: People from the volunteering side will be super happy to actually help you
    get a referral – refer you to jobs or even vouch about your skills, especially
    if you did well. If you contributed and you were active, they will be super happy
    to recommend you and even actually help you find jobs. In the corporate world,
    getting them to do your referral is like trying to push them to wet someone. [chuckles]
    It's really difficult.
  sec: 3081
  time: '51:21'
  who: Sara
- line: In volunteering, you meet people from all over the world. You don't just meet
    people who have worked on one issue or very specific issues – they have worked
    on different things. They have a different broad view –different mindset, different
    cultures. So you get to actually play the role you want. For example, you might
    be the team lead, or you might be a project manager, you might be something that
    you want to doб but in an organization, they can’t give you that position because
    “you don't have to experience, you don't have what it takes to do that”. In volunteering,
    you have flexibility – in a typical job setting, you don't. That's actually one
    of the main advantages. In a work setting, impact is not what is important, most
    of the time – it's actually profit, or the tasks required by the employer. In
    volunteering, the most important thing is actually impact. If something doesn't
    have an impact, most likely, we will scratch it from our list. These are all the
    benefits,
  sec: 3081
  time: '51:21'
  who: Sara
- line: So, experience, connections, and then impact. I guess you also feel good because
    you helped some social cause, right? [Sara agrees]
  sec: 3302
  time: '55:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: And soft skills! These are actually highly vulnerable, but we don't usually
    care much. If you're in an organization, they might not give you the chance to
    present a project, talk about it and then debate it with your peers. But in a
    community, when you're volunteering, you have a bunch of people that you can talk
    to, you get to practice your communication, you get to practice presentations
    (if you want to do that). If you're a non-English speaker and you want to practice
    it, you get the chance to practice your English. Actually, that's one of the reasons
    why so many people think my English is good – it's because I have been collaborating
    with a lot of people and talking in English.

- header: Opportunities for data engineers and students
- line: Right now, in DataTalks.Club, we have a course about data engineering. There
    is a question, “Do you know any opportunities for data engineers?” If I'm a data
    engineer, or if I'm studying to become a data engineer, can I also apply for these
    Omdena projects? Or are they more for data scientists/AI people?
  sec: 3365
  time: '56:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. When you're doing this volunteering work, remember that a task is broad.
    What you want to do is relate to how you want to do it. They're not going to force
    you to do something. This is one of the perks about it. If you're interested in
    data engineering – let's say that in engineering, one of the most important things
    is actually picking the right data and preparing it. You could go ahead and say,
    “I will start a task around data engineering – preparing the data for the data
    scientists or AI or ML people to actually fully leverage it.” You can do that.
    The only thing… [cross-talk]
  sec: 3390
  time: '56:30'
  who: Sara

  sec: 3435
  time: '57:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: By the way, in this volunteering work, most of the time, the data is a huge
    mess. So it's a great experience for you to learn the real mess of data and to
    deal with it.
  sec: 3437
  time: '57:17'
  who: Sara
- line: You mentioned that in one of the hackathons, you also built a dashboard –
    not only a model, but also a dashboard. [Sara agrees] In order to build the dashboard,
    you need to have the foundation. You have to have the data in the right form,
    such that you can present it. This is something that data engineers usually do.
  sec: 3451
  time: '57:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but usually, for example, when you're doing this with everyone in AI
    engineering, you learn a couple of skills that have nothing to do with your title.
    That's actually one of the things that are really cool – you get to touch up on
    all the parts that you might want to explore. But normally in an organization,
    they won't give you the chance to touch it because you don't have the skills.
  sec: 3467
  time: '57:47'
  who: Sara
- header: Sara’s newsletter suggestions
- line: We don't have a lot of time. There’s one last question. You mentioned that
    when you were looking for opportunities, and when you still look for them… I asked
    you, “How do you usually find these opportunities?” And you said, “Social media,
    but right now, I'm cutting down on that. I'm only doing it on a desktop.” But
    you also mentioned that you're subscribed to a newsletter, where you get these
    opportunities from. Can you mention which newsletters these are?
  sec: 3497
  time: '58:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For example, WIML (Women in Machine Learning). They keep posting every
    day about opportunities – PhD opportunities, PhD students opportunities, job opportunities
    for all expertise levels. So please subscribe to their Google Groups mailing list.
    Also NeurIPS has its own mailing list, but NeurIPS is only active during the conference
    days. That's where they usually share about opportunities. They might request
    you to send in your CV so they can send you these specific opportunities. Apart
    from that, there are a couple of great newsletters, but it's for French people
    – for people who are in France or know how to speak French. There are a couple
    of great research newsletters.
  sec: 3527
  time: '58:47'
  who: Sara
- line: There are a lot of them. Just Google them and then you'll find them all over.
    They have great opportunities as well. But there are a couple of other newsletters.
    For example, your newsletter also provides information about opportunities sometimes.
    Just subscribe to newsletters that are AI-specific, especially for communities.
    Usually communities are the ones who share relevant job offers and opportunities.
    But if it's a one-person newsletter about something specific, they might not share
    about them, because that's not their interest. It's not what their audience wants
    from them.

    your experience with us. It was very motivating. I'm sure you managed to convince
    a few of the listeners to actually give it a try. So thanks a lot for doing that.
