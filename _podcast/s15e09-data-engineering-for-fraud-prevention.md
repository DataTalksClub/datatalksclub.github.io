short: Data Engineering for Fraud Prevention
title: Data Engineering for Fraud Prevention
transcript:
- line: This week, we will talk about data engineering and fraud detection. We have
    a very special guest today, Angela. Angela is a data engineer working at Sam's
    Club with their fraud team. She has four years of experience as a data engineer,
    and she's currently specializing in machine learning for fraud prevention. She
    works on designing and maintaining the data for a machine learning system that
    identifies fraudulent transactions. Welcome to the show!
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, glad to be here.
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Angela
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared, as always, by Johanna Bayer.
    Thanks a lot, Johanna, for your help. Let's start.
  sec: 153
  time: '2:33'
  who: Alexey
- header: Angela's background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of data engineering and fraud prevention,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 161
  time: '2:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, for sure. I've been a data engineer for about four years now. I started
    out in Sephora as a data engineer, where I worked more with e-commerce and marketing
    tools but then I later… [cross-talk]
  sec: 170
  time: '2:50'
  who: Angela
- line: That's the store for selling cosmetics, right?
  sec: 180
  time: '3:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. Luxury, cosmetics – those types of items, yeah. Then I moved
    over to Sam's Club about… I want to say about a year back or so. So it's going
    to be two years coming up next year. I've been working within the fraud space,
    which is definitely a bit different, but still with machine learning. You can
    still utilize it, it's just in a different aspect.
  sec: 184
  time: '3:04'
  who: Angela
- line: So I know what Sephora is, because every time I go to a shopping mall, I can
    smell that Sephora is nearby. But what about Sam's Club? What do you do there?
    As a company, what does it do?
  sec: 213
  time: '3:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sam's Club is like Costco – it's a wholesale company. It's actually owned
    by Walmart. Walmart is general ecommerce, but Sam's Club would be considered to
    be a wholesale store, where you can buy things in bulk.
  sec: 225
  time: '3:45'
  who: Angela
- line: What's a wholesale store? I have no idea. [chuckles]
  sec: 240
  time: '4:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's just bulk items. You can buy cases of sodas, and if you have large events
    going on, it's really helpful. They also sell other things like electronics and
    stuff like that. But I think it's considered wholesale because you're able to
    buy things in bulk. A lot of restaurants and other businesses would work with
    Sam's Club.
  sec: 243
  time: '4:03'
  who: Angela
- line: Okay, let's say I want to buy a can of soda (Coke) I can only buy a whole
    pack?
  sec: 270
  time: '4:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. It has to be more of a bulk item rather than a single-use can.
    Yeah.
  sec: 280
  time: '4:40'
  who: Angela
- line: So instead of one chocolate bar, it's like 100, right?
  sec: 288
  time: '4:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. It would be at least a case.
  sec: 292
  time: '4:52'
  who: Angela
- line: Yeah, I think I saw stores like that. They all sort of require you to be members.
    Maybe it's your competitor – Metro. At least… I don't know if they're a competitor,
    but this is what I see in Germany and other countries in Europe. The stores are
    called Metro. Usually, when you enter the store, they ask you for some sort of
    paper proving you are a company or whatever. It's not like you're an individual
    who wants to buy chocolate for cheaper – they want you to be a company, as their
    client.
  sec: 297
  time: '4:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: In this case, with Sam's Club, we allow anybody to be a member. It's really
    helpful for homes that have a lot of people in it, or maybe have a lot of roommates.
    So those are different types of use cases where [going to] a wholesale store would
    make sense. I actually do purchase some items from Sam's Club – usually, protein
    bars or protein drinks, or even specific types of sodas that I can't find anywhere
    else that are far more expensive as a single-use [can].
  sec: 335
  time: '5:35'
  who: Angela
- line: Yeah, I would also buy protein bars in bulk. [chuckles] I buy a lot of them
    anyway. [chuckles]
  sec: 370
  time: '6:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly! Yes. It's cheaper that way because they're far more expensive [as
    single items].
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Angela
- header: Angela's role at Sam's Club
- line: So, as a data engineer, what do you do there? You mentioned fraud.
  sec: 382
  time: '6:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I specifically work within the fraud realm. A lot of the time, as within
    any company, as a data engineer, I will be working on maintaining their data pipelines,
    their different types of jobs, such as batch, or real-time jobs, trying to make
    sure that, if the business requires a specific field or specific dataset – trying
    to design that data set for them. If there's specific analysis involved with our
    machine learning models, making sure that we have dashboards and data feeding
    into those dashboards, where we're able to easily understand our metrics, from
    both the ML level and the business level.
  sec: 388
  time: '6:28'
  who: Angela
- line: I'm not sure into how much detail you can go, but I was just wondering, in
    the case of these wholesale stores, what kind of fraud is there? Does somebody
    pay with stolen credit cards? Things like that?
  sec: 438
  time: '7:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. That's a pretty good use case. It's very similar to credit card
    companies where we're trying to understand if someone steals your identity, or
    someone steals your credit cards, and they start purchasing from Sam's Club, how
    can we prevent that fraud? In addition, there are specific policies that exist
    within different companies, such as different return policies, or different shopping
    policies, where we might notice a trend of member abuse and we might want to block
    that.
  sec: 458
  time: '7:38'
  who: Angela
- line: For example, if I buy a pack of protein bars, eat half of them, and try to
    return the rest, then it would be fraud, right?
  sec: 493
  time: '8:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly.
  sec: 501
  time: '8:21'
  who: Angela
- line: Okay. So what do you do there? Maybe you can tell us in more detail – what
    kind of… I guess, when it comes to fraud detection, you want to react as quickly
    as possible, right? Your pipelines need to be real-time, right? Maybe you can
    tell us a little bit more about what exactly happens when you implement some of
    these use cases?
  sec: 504
  time: '8:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, for sure. We have a batch job that runs on a daily basis that will actually
    make calculations for our feature engineering. We have the batch jobs for our
    feature engineering jobs and that data would then be used during our real live
    system, where if a member is making a purchase, there will be a call to our fraud
    system that will make a decision on whether or not, based off of the criteria
    of that transaction, if it is fraud or not. So depending on what we end up sending,
    that portion is definitely live – us sending that request. If it is fraud, then
    we will block them from making that type of transaction. If it's not fraud, then
    they'll be able to make that transaction.
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Angela
- header: The usefulness of knowing ML as a data engineer
- line: I'm just wondering – in your case, you work with machine learning. Do you
    need to know a lot of machine learning yourself? Or are you more focused on… For
    you, it's more like, “This is the use case and I focus on the data pipeline. I
    know that there is some machine learning happening – there are data scientists
    who deal with that – but I mostly work on making sure that the data is always
    there for these data scientists to consume.”
  sec: 588
  time: '9:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: I do also work on some portion of getting the metrics evaluations during the
    real-time process. We do end up sending our request and our recommendations out.
    Then after we do that, we'll want to make a calculation based on how the model
    is currently performing. So anything that has to do with more of an operational
    side, or more of the deployment and handling after the deployment – that's on
    my team. My team consists of both data engineers and machine learning engineers.
    We deal a lot with machine learning operations as well as data pipelines and creating
    dashboards for our ML metrics. Our data scientists do tend to focus more on the
    model development itself.
  sec: 614
  time: '10:14'
  who: Angela
- line: So you're a part of the engineering team and then there is also the data science
    team.
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Yeah.
  sec: 679
  time: '11:19'
  who: Angela
- line: And by “your team,” you mean you are leading this team? Or do you work in
    this team as a data engineer?
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I work on this team as a data engineer – my lead is a machine learning engineer.
    I work within that team itself.
  sec: 689
  time: '11:29'
  who: Angela
- line: How much machine learning do you need to know for this? Do you need to know
    any [at all]?
  sec: 703
  time: '11:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Having a good background in machine learning for this role is actually really
    helpful. I think it makes it helpful to understand how to do certain analyses,
    but it isn't necessarily required. I work on the side of both analysis and maintaining
    the pipelines themselves, but I have some members who will work on setting up
    the pipelines, working with Kafka more so, and working with those types of access
    and databases. I think with my machine learning background, I do end up working
    on analysis and ad hoc queries. The main thing that I work with is considered
    the network model, so a lot of the stuff that I end up doing is trying to analyze
    the performance of that network model and other tasks around that.
  sec: 710
  time: '11:50'
  who: Angela
- header: Angela's career path
- line: Maybe I forgot, but I don't think you mentioned your background. So what is
    your background? I know that you also do something with NLP, right? I assume your
    background actually does involve machine learning. You know it, but at work, you
    are more focused on the engineering part, right?
  sec: 768
  time: '12:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I actually majored in cognitive science with an emphasis on human-computer
    interaction and artificial intelligence, which, I want to say, is more user experience-focused,
    as well as more AI-focused. But I had a minor in computer science. During my undergrad,
    I focused a lot more on working with big data and understanding the impact of
    that. I did end up majoring in natural language processing. I think for a lot
    of NLP, currently, machine learning has been one of the more recent approaches
    that I find to be very useful – like the transformer-based models and more recently,
    ChatGPT. So I've gotten some experience with that.
  sec: 791
  time: '13:11'
  who: Angela
- line: Just curious, if you focused on NLP and machine learning, how and why did
    you end up doing data engineering?
  sec: 842
  time: '14:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. When I was at Sephora, that was one of the roles that I ended up working
    towards. I think a big reason why I tend to work with data engineering is because
    I really love the importance of data within the ecosystem of NLP and ML. A lot
    of times people don't really understand that data really is the root of these
    processes. Even ChatGPT – in order for it to be able to be ChatGPT, it should
    have been trained on a bunch of data, there must have been pipelines that were
    scraping the data, putting that data into its training loop, and being able to
    maintain it on a daily basis as well. They are probably also getting requests
    on a daily basis, where they're having to consume that data and then be able to
    analyze the performance of their models, and then use it for their new methodology
    of reinforcement learning using humans' feedback. So data is really a part of
    all the ecosystem.
  sec: 854
  time: '14:14'
  who: Angela
- line: That's really a big reason why I like to focus on data engineering – because
    I feel like I don't necessarily have to work on the model, but it lets me understand
    what's going on with the models themselves. Maintaining the data, in my opinion,
    is one of the most critical components that you can have. If there are any failures,
    if there are any quality issues, your system will fail, and your system will have
    issues, and your models won't really work. So you might think your models are
    working perfectly fine but if your data is not there, they're they're going to
    fail.
  sec: 854
  time: '14:14'
  who: Angela
- line: Did you join Sephora as a data engineer, or did you first join as a data scientist
    and then transitioned?
  sec: 954
  time: '15:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's interesting, I actually joined as an intern – as a continuous process
    improvement intern. So I worked with... [cross-talk]
  sec: 962
  time: '16:02'
  who: Angela
- line: Continuous process what, sorry?
  sec: 968
  time: '16:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Continuous process improvement intern.
  sec: 971
  time: '16:11'
  who: Angela
- line: What does that mean? [chuckles]
  sec: 974
  time: '16:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I thought the same thing when I joined. They told me that I was going
    to be identifying how to streamline processes. So I learned more about diagramming
    and system design. I used a combination of system design to identify pain points
    within whatever system they were [using].
  sec: 975
  time: '16:15'
  who: Angela
- line: Process modeling?
  sec: 1000
  time: '16:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, yes.
  sec: 1002
  time: '16:42'
  who: Angela
- line: I remember seeing something like BMPN – business process modeling notation
    or something like that. Did you need to do these things?
  sec: 1003
  time: '16:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I did end up having to learn about... I would talk to people about their
    business process, how they would work with a specific tool, and the issues that
    they would have with that tooling, and based on that, I came up with different
    suggestions or more of a holistic view of what was going on.
  sec: 1015
  time: '16:55'
  who: Angela
- header: Transitioning from data analyst to data engineer/system designer
- line: So it's a bit higher-level work than being a software engineer because you
    need to analyze the whole system and then document it and then understand how
    it works and propose improvements. Okay, this is what you joined to do, but how
    did you end up doing data engineering? Because it sounds even less… not relevant,
    but… It's like data science and what you were studying is closer to data engineering
    than that, probably. But maybe it's just my ignorance.
  sec: 1038
  time: '17:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah – I then worked as a data analyst for the company and then they were
    hiring for data engineering internally, so I was then able to talk to that manager
    and he was willing to hire me on as a data engineer because I wanted to work more
    with a tech stack. As an analyst, I was working more with things like Tableau,
    I was trying to build out how we could consolidate data sets and databases together
    in order to get different metrics for the team that I was working with, which
    was basically like data engineering in a way. That's when I really wanted to make
    that move.
  sec: 1077
  time: '17:57'
  who: Angela
- line: Honestly, I would say, that the system design, has been only useful when I
    have to document the type of pipelines that we've generated and created. So if
    we're noticing that data is going from point A to point B, creating that pipeline
    has been something that I've – and documenting how that pipeline looks – is where
    that skill has come in. So more on the architect side of things, if anything.
  sec: 1077
  time: '17:57'
  who: Angela
- line: Okay, so this knowledge does help you be a better data engineer.
  sec: 1146
  time: '19:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's more of thinking about the overall big picture. I think it's also
    helpful when thinking about things like the timing of data engineering jobs –
    there are a lot of questions you have to ask when you're first working to create
    a data engineering job, like who your stakeholders are, because then that can
    affect the timings of when your data engineering job should occur, and etc, etc.
    So there are definitely things to consider when trying to work with it.
  sec: 1155
  time: '19:15'
  who: Angela
- header: Best practices for system design and data engineering
- line: Okay. Well, what we talked about – the system design – I think this falls
    into the category of having good documentation that describes this. The other
    thing you mentioned – knowing who the stakeholders are – is also helpful. I'm
    wondering, what are the general best practices that you need to follow when you
    are a data engineer in order to make sure that the thing you're working on actually
    makes sense, is reliable, and working well? So apart from having good documentation
    and knowing who the stakeholders are, there are probably other best practices.
  sec: 1188
  time: '19:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, absolutely. I think that goes to the type of data that you're hosting,
    how much data you're passing through, whether it's… I think, when you're looking
    at database design, that's where good principles really come in, and understanding
    the type of data that you're working with because then that affects... For instance,
    if you're working with dynamic data, you're going to be wanting more of a document-based
    database.
  sec: 1230
  time: '20:30'
  who: Angela
- line: If you're working with data that's more static, you're going to want something
    more relational. In addition, once you understand the type of data that you're
    working with as well, it'll help you figure out the type of model that you have
    – if you're working with network-based data, that's a network model, and you want
    to use something like neo4J and when you're working with relational, then you
    have to decide whether or not you want to use STAR schema or Snowflake schema,
    and whether or not that really applies in your case.
  sec: 1230
  time: '20:30'
  who: Angela
- header: Working with document databases
- line: You mentioned this document database – if the data is more dynamic, then you
    need to document the database (if it's static/relational). I was wondering, what's
    your experience with document databases? Because I heard very mixed messages about
    things like Mongo, DynamoDB, or other more “document databases. What's your experience
    with them?
  sec: 1290
  time: '21:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: I've only worked, currently, with relational databases – specifically, Cassandra,
    Redis, those types – and then I've worked a bit with network-based databases,
    like Elasticsearch and those types of datasets.
  sec: 1317
  time: '21:57'
  who: Angela
- line: So Elasticsearch is more like a network-based [database]?
  sec: 1337
  time: '22:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly.
  sec: 1340
  time: '22:20'
  who: Angela
- line: Oh. Okay. I always thought of Elasticsearch as more of a document database,
    because you index a document.
  sec: 1342
  time: '22:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think you can, but I think the way that we've used it… Yeah, we've
    used it with indexing as well. I think since I've worked with it with network-based
    data. But yes, it's indexed and it has a specific structure there. So I think
    that's why I kind of think about it more as a network, even though we probably
    just adjusted our network data to be more document-based.
  sec: 1350
  time: '22:30'
  who: Angela
- line: Can you give an example of how exactly you put a network (and what kind of
    network) you would put in Elasticsearch?
  sec: 1376
  time: '22:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: So this would be like Wikidata.
  sec: 1384
  time: '23:04'
  who: Angela
- line: Wikidata?
  sec: 1388
  time: '23:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For the Amazon Alexa Prize competition – I've worked on that for my
    Master's program – and even more recently, just for mentoring a couple of students.
    They work with Elasticsearch to be able to store their entity-based data. For
    instance, let's say you want to store information about books, like the author
    of a book, then you also want information about the year that book was created
    – we would want to store that book name as a document, and then it's relations
    within that database as well. So when the system's actually running, we're able
    to easily retrieve that information using different SPARQL queries.
  sec: 1389
  time: '23:09'
  who: Angela
- line: There was a lot of information… I think I've heard SPARQL before, but maybe
    for those who did not… First, you mentioned Wikidata, right? What is Wikidata?
  sec: 1444
  time: '24:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Wikidata is actually built on top of Wikipedia. Wikidata has information regarding
    different entities. It's similar to Wikipedia, where you'll have editors of this
    network graph. To be able to gather this information, you need to be able to use
    this query-based language called SPARQL. It's very similar to SQL, but it has
    its own specific way of relating relations and entities together, and even getting
    inverse relations from the graph itself. So it's just a different way of querying
    data, based on the structure that it has.
  sec: 1459
  time: '24:19'
  who: Angela
- header: Working with network-based databases
- line: From what I remember about Wikidata – you have Wikipedia, and the data on
    Wikipedia is not structured. Most of the time, it's just free text somebody put
    – an article about Game of Thrones, the book, for example. In the book, usually,
    people just write some information, and there is this table that is kind of structured,
    but it's free text – who the author is, when the book was written, and so on.
    There is a bunch of information there.
  sec: 1503
  time: '25:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Wikidata is an attempt to get this information from unstructured (or semi-structured)
    data and put it in a machine-processable format such that you then can just run
    a query [on it]. Can you give an example of a query that you can run? For example,
    with books.
  sec: 1503
  time: '25:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Just select the book name, and then you would just use the relation of “what
    is book” and then that's where you'll do “?book” and then the relationship for
    that. Then you'll have the actual book name here. Because if not, then you'll
    just get the entity node. So that's what you want to grab. So you'll just push
    back “book name”.
  sec: 1565
  time: '26:05'
  who: Angela
- line: I'm just wondering what kind of queries in addition… For example, I have this
    Game of Thrones book and I want to find all the other books by the same author,
    and then I can easily express that. Or books that were published in the same year.
  sec: 1599
  time: '26:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so you'd want to do some sort of filtering statement, where you'd want
    to then filter by year, and have that specific year there or that specific name.
    That's exactly what we ended up trying to do – during the conversation, you might
    want to bring up other books related to Game of Thrones like, “Did you read the
    following sequel (the next book)?” Or “Have you read this book, which was [published]
    in the same year?” Then you would want to construct your queries to be able to
    filter these books based on the year and then send those titles back. Then you
    would just grab one, to then talk about it with the user. Then, if you want to
    pick it even further, you can do filtering on top of the genre itself. Let's say
    you want year and genre, to make it a bit more relevant, you would just alter
    your SQL query to be able to filter for that information and then give you that
    list of books to then recommend.

    are different books (or just objects in general). Then we know that these books
    have links between each other and the link could be something like the author,
    right? For example, there is the entity, “George Martin,” and there is the entity
    “book,” and then we know that the relation between these two entities (these two
    nodes) is that George Martin is the author of this book. Then there is another
    entity, “year of publishing” and we know that “Okay, this book was published in
    this year,” and so on.

    know. Maybe you actually do that – I don't know into how much detail you can go
    there. You probably don't want to reveal how your flood prevention system works,

    you have there.

    to other transactions using specific correlations that can be similar to one another.
    Let's say we want to get all the transactions and we want to see if maybe there's
    a trend with the products involved. Maybe we want to get all the similar transactions
    with similar products and then based on that, if there are specific transaction
    networks where we notice that these transaction networks and these products have
    been related to certain fraud cases, then we might want to maybe use this as an
    additional vector, or use this as like additional information.

    we have products, we have customers – all these things are nodes in this network.
    Then we know, “Okay, there is this transaction with this number that involves
    this customer – it involves these sorts of products.” Then we have this network.
    We see all the customers, we see all the transactions. We know, in some cases,
    what the fraud cases are. We know, “Okay, this transaction was fraudulent.”
  sec: 1816

  who: Alexey
- line: What that gives us is access to other transactions that are similar and maybe
    they're fraudulent, too. Maybe this customer (or customers) that are similar to
    this customer bought this product – maybe these transactions are also fraudulent.
    Then we can send them to our machine learning model for checking. Is this how
    it works?
  sec: 1816

  who: Alexey

    very vague, and nonspecific. Because you could just add it as a layer based on
    this type of network criteria that we would send to the model. Or you could even
    use it as an additional feature. Or you can use it during your analysis and if
    there's a very specific trend going on, where specific combinations of member
    and transaction networks, maybe you'll want to block certain transactions from
    happening based on the networks that are created.

  sec: 1916

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a great question. Usually, we do get that information about whether
    or not this is a stolen credit card, or whether or not this is a fraudulent transaction.

    ended up looking towards.

    have this information, the Coke is already gone.

    make this even better?”

    something, then we might have specific protocols in mind that would get flagged.
  sec: 1995

    fast – how do you design a system with these requirements in mind, such that when
    somebody tries to pay with a stolen credit card, the security guard can get notified
    immediately? How should the architecture look for this sort of system?
  sec: 2014
  time: '33:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would assume that it wouldn't necessarily start with a machine learning
    check, to be honest. I would assume that there would be specific roles, which
    I guess could be machine learning if it's role-based. But we could start with
    specific roles in mind, looking at those checks, and then you would have to work
    with your front-end team to be able to actually show some sort of signal to your
    cashier, which can then be triggered to your security worker, or which will then
    flag a sort of wave of different protocols. So I'm assuming it would have to be
    multiple systems trying to communicate with each other based on that one call.
  sec: 2038

  sec: 2086

    batch jobs allow us to – we've already made the calculations themselves, and then
    we're able to bring forth that information. Then, in addition, within our system
    itself, we'll make real-time calculations based on information within the payload.
    That will happen almost instantaneously.

    I don't know if it makes sense to talk about it in a podcast format – it's probably
    very difficult to understand all that. But I'm wondering – in this case, you use
    a network database, but sometimes you can just use a relational database, right?
    Maybe in some cases, it will work even faster, instead of traversing all these
    nodes. You know in advance what kind of queries you will use, so you build your
    relational database in such a way that it's very easy and fast to answer these
    queries.
  sec: 2133
  time: '35:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm wondering, how do you make a decision on which database to use for a specific
    use case? Should you go with key value store? Should you go with document store?
    Should it go with a traditional relational database? Do you have a rule of thumb
    or maybe some criteria you use for evaluating this decision?
  sec: 2133
  time: '35:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think that's where your type of data comes in. If you notice that
    it's not going to ever change, your schema will probably remain stagnant, then
    relational will probably be the better case to go with. If you're noticing that
    dynamic – that's when you have to actually think about the document. I've never
    worked with dynamic data. But that is, from my experience, the criteria for that.
    Then in terms of more of the key value store, it's just a matter of what the use
    case that you're working with is and whether it actually makes sense for that
    type of data point that you're trying to capture. Because if in the end, you're
    just trying to put everything into tables, I can't see why you can't use a relational
    database.
  sec: 2195
  time: '36:35'
  who: Angela
- line: But if you need a specific type of analysis, or a specific type of structure
    for your data – I think that also depends on the structure of your data as well,
    actually, because we've mentioned like unstructured versus structured. With structured
    data, that's perfect for a relational database, especially if it's static. That's
    a specific criterion for those types of databases. But with unstructured data,
    you can always find a way to take unstructured data and turn it into structured
    data, which is possible, such as taking it from... maybe you have like a JSON.
    But if there's an additional layer on top of it, that's where I think you have
    to rethink the type of database that you're working with, or maybe get a bit more
    creative there.

    it's a good database, but there are not so many people who have a lot of experience
    working with this database.” Sometimes what happens is when you hit some problem
    with this database, it's a lot more difficult to find a workaround. Did you have
    to experience something like that? Or for your use case, it was actually a good
    decision to use Neo4j, instead of, let's say, Postgres?
  sec: 2291
  time: '38:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think for our use case, it makes more sense to use Neo4j, only because of
    the type of visualizations that you can be able to do with this. I would say that
    you could definitely have some problems in terms of understanding how to query
    your data correctly. But I think if you're working with data where it's pretty
    understandable and pretty easy to work with and your relations aren't necessarily
    too complex, it could be really helpful in trying to understand the type of networks
    that are being formed.

    by clicking. [Angela agrees] This is probably useful for… In the company where
    I previously worked, we also had an anti-fraud department. In addition to machine
    learning engineers, data scientists, analysts and so on, who would work on solutions,
    there were also anti-fraud specialists who were not super technical – they were
    more like domain experts – and they were one of the stakeholders (the users) of
    this tool.

    Just by looking at some data, they need to make a decision like, “Should we ban
    this user? Or should we set them free?” For them, it was important to actually
    be able to open a graph like that and traverse it to see, “What are the other
    connected users?” In your case, it's something similar.

    trying to visualize the network graph. We can always give them tables that can
    easily try to give them sort of that snippet of information. But there's a lot
    more complexity on their side and a lot more time that they end up spending having
    to look at this data in a more tabular format.

    so I think maybe we should cover them. The first question is, “How much software
    engineering is required when you work as a data engineer?”
  sec: 2450
  time: '40:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think there are good software engineering principles that you should be
    able to hold when working as a data engineer. Because we do end up working a lot
    with either Scala or Spark – Spark is probably one of the biggest libraries that
    I've worked with. I specifically work with PySpark. But in my previous company,
    we worked entirely with just Scala Spark. So you should be able to at least work
    with these different languages and be able to construct your code in a way where
    it makes sense. I think, generally, as a data engineer, you should also think
    about the different types of testing that you might want to complete. I think
    software engineers really know how to create good unit tests to really test the
    system as a whole.
  sec: 2469
  time: '41:09'
  who: Angela
- line: But we would have to think about it from the data engineering perspective
    like, “How can we add in data quality checks within our pipeline on top of the
    dataset that you're creating itself?” So if you want to add in null checks, if
    you want to add in checks for the specific date types, or specific types within
    your schema to make sure that there's no failure there – that's where having a
    really good ability of using test and looking for different libraries is really
    helpful. So there are definitely software engineering principles and practices
    that you'd probably want to utilize with data engineering.
  sec: 2469
  time: '41:09'
  who: Angela
- line: So what you said is that there is quite a lot of software engineering knowledge
    that you need to have – all these programming languages, testing, best practices
    – but there are other things in addition to that, which are data quality checks,
    null checks, etc. Would you say a data engineer is something like a specialized
    software engineer – one who specializes in data?
  sec: 2563
  time: '42:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think that's a great way of putting it. As a software engineer, usually
    people think about the application or the system like, “How could it fail?” So
    you then have to put on a different hat and instead of thinking about the application,
    you think about the data itself. So yeah, that's a that's a perfect way of putting
    it.
  sec: 2588

- header: Data quality check tooling
- line: Just curious, what kind of tools do you use for these data quality checks?
  sec: 2608
  time: '43:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can use something like Great Expectations. You can also build your own
    types of unit tests, or your own framework if you'd wanted to. Great Expectations
    is one of the ones that always comes to mind for me, but I'm pretty sure there
    are other third-party companies or toolings that have that in place. Even if you
    look at other data profiling tools and stuff like that, they might also have a
    layer of data quality. Even cloud services like Google BigQuery, they have data
    quality checks integrated within their platform itself. So you don't necessarily
    need a specific library or to add in those tests, but you need to identify how
    you can start adding in those tests into your pipeline.
  sec: 2613
  time: '43:33'
  who: Angela
- line: So as a data engineer, you need to be aware that these things are important,
    and you need to think about them when you design your data pipeline so that you
    don't forget to include the data quality checks.

  sec: 2681
  time: '44:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a really good question. I think one of the most challenging tasks is
    when 1) Your job fails and you don't know what If your job is failing. Usually,
    as an entry-level data engineer, when you're first starting out, you're not really
    sure how a job specifically works – that's when you have to really look into your
    log files to understand whether it's the code. Because if it's the code, then
    it's probably a bug or a fix that you need to make. Is it a schema change that
    happened not because of you, but because of your incoming source of data? If your
    source has changed, I think that having that visibility is difficult sometimes
    because it can cause your job to fail. If, when calling your database, it's having
    issues with... maybe your database is failing because there are too many requests
    at a time and maybe it's processing too much data, so maybe you need to think
    about whether you need to make this an independent job.
  sec: 2691
  time: '44:51'
  who: Angela
- line: So when your job fails, it really makes you have to think very creatively
    and understand why it's failing, what's going on, and whether it might be a bigger
    improvement that needs to be made during that time. I think that's one of the
    biggest challenges as a data engineer – we might make certain configurations based
    on the data load that we've tested with within the testing environment, but once
    we actually identify how many of the jobs that we actually have running concurrently,
    in parallel, and just these different aspects that could actually affect your
    system. Then you'd have to start reconfiguring, and re-optimizing your jobs –
    maybe it's an optimization within the code level. I think that's one of the biggest
    struggles as a data engineer – just trying to identify what the best solution
    is for the job that I'm working on.
  sec: 2691
  time: '44:51'
  who: Angela
- header: Debugging and finding the root cause of a failed job
- line: You mentioned multiple reasons why a job can fail. The first reason is the
    code – there is a bug in your pipeline, in your PySpark job or in your script.
    Then there may be a schema change – there's upstream data that you consume and
    then the team that is producing this data changes something there. There could
    be an issue with that database – the database that you write to or the database
    that you read from. I think you're only scratching the surface here. There can
    be so many other reasons why it could fail, right? It could be an error in the
    code, as you mentioned. It could be an error in the data – maybe there is an erroneous
    record that goes through your pipeline. There is a null somewhere and you expect
    a number – all of a sudden, your entire job fails just because of that record.
  sec: 2816
  time: '46:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: There could be millions of reasons like that. Debugging (finding the root
    cause) could be a nightmare. I remember that. I understand why it's one of the
    most challenging things to do. So do you have an algorithm to figure out what
    the root cause is? How do you usually go about that?
  sec: 2816
  time: '46:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Usually, once you actually get accustomed to your jobs and the type of errors
    that you see, there tends to be a trend in how you solve them. I really think
    it comes with experience, because I think when you first start out as a data engineer,
    you're not really sure about these types of errors. But once you've actually worked
    with these jobs, you become familiar with them, then you start noticing, “Oh,
    it's probably a database issue,” or “Oh, it's probably something with my code.”
    There are also some times when your job doesn't fail – your job works perfectly
    fine, but the data is incorrect because of the upstream team. Maybe you're just
    not getting a column correctly anymore.
  sec: 2901
  time: '48:21'
  who: Angela
- line: So it's very much a trial and error process, but once you understand the errors
    that you're working with and the data that you're working with, you can figure
    out the trends and the patterns pretty easily, I would say. I think if you're
    still struggling with it, I would suggest creating some documentation with common
    error types that you're seeing and then identifying what the solutions were to
    actually solve them. If you create really good documentation for your jobs, which
    you should, then you can create run books for how to actually solve them pretty
    easily so that not only you, but anyone within your support team, can be able
    to solve these issues pretty easily.
  sec: 2901
  time: '48:21'
  who: Angela
- line: That sounds like a great piece of advice for any data engineer, and specifically,
    Junior data engineers who just started. When you have a task that is failing and
    your job is to figure out why – if they try to do what you just said, maybe you'll
    spend a few days trying to figure out what's happening, but if you document everything,
    and if you also document how to fix this problem next time, the entire team will
    be so glad.

    what the question was. “What kind of tools do you use on a daily basis?”
  sec: 3023
  time: '50:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: I specifically use GCP, and Databricks. I've worked with Cassandra and I work
    with TablePlus to be able to connect to that. I work with PySpark probably every
    day. I've worked a bit with Pandas, but I don't have to use that quite often within
    this current role. However, I know some people who love using Pandas as well,
    especially with the new PyArrow implementation change that they recently made
    with that. I primarily work with PySpark and GCP cloud services. I've worked with
    Dataproc and BigQuery.
  sec: 3037
  time: '50:37'
  who: Angela

  sec: 3083
  time: '51:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's kind of like… I know Azure has a similar cluster configuration,
    where you're able to run your job and your clusters that way. Dataproc is more
    of a “managing your clusters” tool. But I know they also have serverless management
    now within that tooling as well. That's something that people should look into
    as well because that's pretty powerful – having jobs that don't necessarily require
    servers.
  sec: 3119
  time: '51:59'
  who: Angela
- line: So in this case, let's say we have a PySpark script (PySpark job) and we want
    to execute this job on a specific piece of data. Typically, the way it works is,
    that you need to have a Spark cluster where you can execute this job. Then you
    need to provision all these machines, you need to configure it, and Dataproc makes
    it easier. I didn't work a lot with ПCP – I worked with AWS. In AWS, there is
    a thing called ElasticMapReduce (EMR). Basically, by clicking a few buttons, you
    can get the Spark cluster and then you can execute.
  sec: 3124
  time: '52:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: The serverless thing that you mentioned is – instead of worrying about provisioning
    all these clusters and then managing them somehow, you just say, “Hey, Google.
    This is my PySpark job. Execute it somewhere. I don't care where.” And then it
    just executes stuff. That sounds pretty convenient.
  sec: 3124
  time: '52:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. Right. I think that's hopefully going to be the future of data
    engineering jobs because it seems like that would be probably the most ideal way
    to go.
  sec: 3187
  time: '53:07'
  who: Angela
- line: I remember when debugging a Spark job, it's not always easy to, first of all,
    make sure that you have enough computers there (enough executors), then select
    the proper machines for the job, then make sure they have enough memory and all
    that – you could spend days tuning this. With serverless, I guess, it's just much
    easier. You mentioned that there is a PyArrow change in pandas. Do you know what
    that is? What kind of change was made?
  sec: 3198
  time: '53:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. With Pandas, it's now running with PyArrow, so it's supposed to be a
    lot more efficient when it's running. Before I think Pandas wasn't running in
    a distributed fashion, so it was running a lot slower for that reason. But with
    PyArrow, it provides the ability to run in a distributed fashion, which is quite
    helpful. Because if you're just running something on a single instance, and you're
    working with Big Data… I also think one of the biggest issues with Pandas is that
    it does have a cap with the data size that it works with. I'm not sure if PyArrow
    somehow handles that differently, but from my understanding, that's one of the
    drawbacks of using something like Pandas – you won't necessarily be able to load
    all of the data into a single frame. But PyArrow is more of allowing it to be
    run at a faster rate.
  sec: 3239
  time: '53:59'
  who: Angela
- line: In a gist, it just became faster because of some internal changes. [Angela
    agrees] That's cool. You also mentioned another tool that you use regularly –
    Cassandra. I'm wondering, what are the use cases for Cassandra? Because for Cassandra,
    maybe my information is outdated, but you actually need to have a cluster, again
    – a cluster that you manage. Or maybe you get a managed cluster from somewhere.
    I'm wondering, “Okay, what is it good for? For what kind of use cases should I
    consider using Cassandra?

- line: Cassandra is like a relational database. So if you're working with structured
    data, if you're working with data where it's relational (it can be in tabular
    format) that's where it can be helpful. I believe it's also fault-tolerant and
    it's really good with scalability. But you're right, it does need the clusters
    – you do need a cluster to be able to run a Cassandra database.

- line: So it's good for analytics or for transactional? I guess for transactional,
    you should use something else. But the main use case is more analytical stuff,
    right?

  who: Alexey

- line: Okay. Well, another question is, “How much of a challenge is it to get data
    from external sources?”
  sec: 3379
  time: '56:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a really good question because I think it depends on what you mean
    by “external sources”. For us, it could be, even though our data is internal within
    the company, maybe you're working with an external team. So it's being able to
    identify what teams that you need to work with in order to get the different datasets
    within your database so then your analysts have that access as well. It can be
    difficult to find the person and then find good documentation on that data in
    terms of how to use it properly. I think that's probably a very difficult thing
    to look at.
  sec: 3391
  time: '56:31'
  who: Angela
- line: Then, if you're working with businesses outside (third-party services), let's
    say, within my company, maybe we're working with a third-party fraud service,
    where they're also running a fraud check. We would want to be able to get that
    information into our system somehow and be able to read that in. Then there's
    that layer of getting the documentation from their team to be able to understand
    what's going on. I think one of the issues with that is just making sure that
    you're getting the data on a daily basis and nothing from their side changes.
    In general, I think working with any external teams, or any external third-party
    service, to get data – or even through something like an API call – one of the
    worries of a data engineer is, “Is their data going to change at any point without
    me knowing?” Or “Is this data not going to be able to be consumed after a period
    of time?”
  sec: 3391
  time: '56:31'
  who: Angela
- line: So there are different talks that have to go on in terms of creating that
    type of data contract and understanding how their external teamwork works, as
    well as understanding, “Is this data going to be on a batch basis at a specific
    time? Is this something that's real-time or occurs every four or five hours?”
    And then understanding how that would impact your analysis and your jobs and all
    of that? Yeah, I think working with external teams does bring in some difficulties,
    definitely in terms of, “Who do I talk to? Where do I get this data? How often
    will I get it? Will this data ever change?”
  sec: 3391
  time: '56:31'
  who: Angela
- line: So it is challenging, and you need to think about… you mentioned data contracts.
    You need to somehow understand how exactly the data should look, and you need
    to make sure that it doesn't change. The API that is already there does not change
    all of a sudden – what used to be a number does not become a string or whatever,
    right?
  sec: 3543
  time: '59:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly.
  sec: 3566
  time: '59:26'
  who: Angela
- line: I already hear the bells from a church nearby, which means that it's actually
    time we wrap up. There are a few more questions. Maybe my question to you is if
    it's okay that people reach out to you somehow and ask these questions.
  sec: 3569
  time: '59:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn, and I'll definitely answer
    from there.
  sec: 3588
  time: '59:48'
  who: Angela
- header: Angela's resource recommendations
- line: Yeah, thank you. Well, maybe the last one before we wrap up. We talked about
    many things. We covered many topics. Are there good resources – it could be courses,
    books, or articles, that you recommend to our listeners if they want to find out
    more and learn more about these topics?
  sec: 3596
  time: '59:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: My biggest suggestion – I love the O'Reilly books. I definitely suggest getting
    the data engineering best principles – so more of an overview book. I don't want
    to specifically say a specific book type in case people have their preferences.
    But I think getting something that's more data of engineering overview, getting
    something that's more of Designing Data-Intensive Applications – I think that's
    a specific O'Reilly book that I would definitely recommend. Then definitely something
    with PySpark, SQL, to be able to always look those types of questions up during
    your interviews.
  sec: 3617
  time: '1:00:17'
  who: Angela
- line: I think I read this Designing Data-Intensive Applications book like two times.
    I think if I read it a third time, I'll still find a lot of information there.
  sec: 3662
  time: '1:01:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, absolutely. It's definitely a good one.
  sec: 3672
  time: '1:01:12'
  who: Angela
- line: Okay, Angela, thanks a lot for joining us today. That was really great talking
    with you today. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today – for watching and
    asking questions. I guess that's it for today and have a great rest of your week!
