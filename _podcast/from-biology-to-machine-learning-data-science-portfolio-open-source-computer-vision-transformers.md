- header: 'Episode Introduction: Continuous Learning in Data Science (guest Isabella
    Bicalho)'
- line: This week, we’re talking about continuous learning in data science. Our guest
    is Isabella, a machine learning engineer and data scientist with three years of
    hands-on AI development experience. She also has a background in computational
    research, contributes to open-source projects, and runs a newsletter showcasing
    women’s accomplishments in data science. Welcome, Isabella!
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you so much. I’m very happy to be here.
  sec: 418
  time: '6:58'
  who: Isabella
- header: 'Career Overview: Transition from Biology to Machine Learning'
- line: The questions for today’s interview were prepared by Johanna Beer. Thanks,
    Johanna! Isabella, let’s start with your career journey. Can you tell us about
    it so far?
  sec: 421
  time: '7:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have a somewhat unusual background. My first degree was a bachelor’s in
    biological science, and I always wanted to be a bioinformatician. Luckily, my
    university allowed me to take courses from other departments, so I enrolled in
    computer science classes like data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented
    programming.
  sec: 435
  time: '7:15'
  who: Isabella
- line: After that, I did a master’s in bioinformatics, where I was introduced to
    machine learning. Around that time, the machine learning boom started, and I never
    looked back. It completely changed my career, and I realized how much I loved
    it.
  sec: 435
  time: '7:15'
  who: Isabella
- line: So, was your shift to machine learning intentional, or was it more of a coincidence?
  sec: 499
  time: '8:19'
  who: Alexey
- header: Statistics as Gateway to Machine Learning; Progression to Transformers
- line: It was a mix. I always liked data and thought I’d become more of a data engineer.
    Statistics was my gateway into machine learning. Once I understood distributions
    and linear modeling, it naturally led to functions and, eventually, advanced techniques
    like transformers.
  sec: 509
  time: '8:29'
  who: Isabella
- line: I was in the right place at the right time and fell in love with it. If I
    had started with a passion for machine learning, it might have felt overwhelming.
  sec: 509
  time: '8:29'
  who: Isabella
- line: Where did you study?
  sec: 552
  time: '9:12'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Education: University of Maranhão and University of Marseille'
- line: I did my bachelor’s in Brazil at the University of Maranhão and my master’s
    in France at the University of Marseille.
  sec: 554
  time: '9:14'
  who: Isabella
- line: Are you originally from Brazil?
  sec: 569
  time: '9:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I am.
  sec: 572
  time: '9:32'
  who: Isabella
- line: Your last name doesn’t sound French.
  sec: 573
  time: '9:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I’m not French at all! But I’ve been living here for about four years.
  sec: 577
  time: '9:37'
  who: Isabella
- line: Do you speak French?
  sec: 587
  time: '9:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I do.
  sec: 588
  time: '9:48'
  who: Isabella
- line: Did you learn it before moving to France?
  sec: 589
  time: '9:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I learned French before moving to France. I wouldn't have dared to move
    without speaking the language—it’s very hard.
  sec: 592
  time: '9:52'
  who: Isabella
- line: Especially if it’s not Paris. I lived in a small city in France, and it’s
    very difficult to get by with just English.
  sec: 597
  time: '9:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I used to live in Marseille, and it’s different because it’s such a tourist
    hub. You’d hear people speaking Arabic, English, and German on the streets, especially
    in the summer. It could get a bit crazy when cruise ships docked, and the city
    would fill up with tourists. I remember not being able to find water in the supermarkets
    because the city wasn’t equipped to handle the influx.
  sec: 608
  time: '10:08'
  who: Isabella
- line: Marseille is unique in that sense, but when it comes to administrative work,
    you really need to speak French.
  sec: 608
  time: '10:08'
  who: Isabella
- line: We also noticed on your LinkedIn profile that you’ve done several internships
    while studying, including one at INRIA, which is quite well known. I’m familiar
    with them because I started there. What did you work on at INRIA? And can you
    explain what INRIA is?
  sec: 643
  time: '10:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'INRIA Internship: Biomarkers and Immunotherapy Prediction'
- line: INRIA is a French research institute. Its full name translates to the National
    Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology. They originally focused
    on automation, but that term has evolved to mean AI in their context.
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Isabella
- line: Before starting my internship, I didn’t know much about INRIA. I learned just
    a week prior that they were involved in projects like Scikit-learn, which made
    me feel a lot of pressure—I realized I was joining a big name.
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Isabella
- line: I got the internship through a career development module in my master’s program.
    They invited professionals to share their career paths, and a researcher named
    Sebastian gave a talk. He was a mathematician who applied his expertise to biomarkers
    and cancer research. I had done my bachelor’s thesis on biomarkers, so I reached
    out to him afterward, expressing interest in his work. He invited me to do an
    internship, and I worked with his team for two months.
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Isabella
- line: We developed models to predict patient responses to immunotherapy for a specific
    type of lung cancer, using just a simple blood draw. It was an incredible experience
    because I was part of a small, collaborative team. We worked in an open space,
    so if I had a question while coding, I could ask someone and get immediate feedback.
    It was enriching and rewarding, and I’m still friends with some of the people
    I met there.
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Isabella
- line: Is INRIA based in Paris?
  sec: 810
  time: '13:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, the team I worked with had recently moved to Marseille. Originally, they
    were based in Bordeaux, which is on the coast.
  sec: 811
  time: '13:31'
  who: Isabella
- line: I’m not sure where Bordeaux is.
  sec: 826
  time: '13:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Think of France as a hexagon. Bordeaux is on the lower left corner, near the
    Atlantic coast.
  sec: 829
  time: '13:49'
  who: Isabella
- line: I’ve heard of Bordeaux but haven’t been there. Even though I lived in France,
    I only know the places I visited. Does INRIA focus exclusively on machine learning
    and AI?
  sec: 840
  time: '14:00'
  who: Alexey
- header: INRIA's Role in AI Research and France's AI Ecosystem
- line: No, they also conduct statistical and foundational research. However, they’ve
    gained a lot of recognition in AI and machine learning because they’re at the
    forefront of the field. For instance, they co-published research on algorithms
    like SPAtting or SPlaTting—I can never remember the exact name.
  sec: 865
  time: '14:25'
  who: Isabella
- line: France has been heavily investing in AI innovation, and INRIA benefits from
    that. The government is very supportive of AI research.
  sec: 865
  time: '14:25'
  who: Isabella
- line: When I think about AI in France, I think of companies like Mistral. It seems
    like France has become a hub for AI innovation. In contrast, there aren’t many
    similar companies in Germany.
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s partly because President Macron has been very proactive about promoting
    AI. France has several prominent companies, like Mistral, Hugging Face, and startups
    like JustCallToo, which focuses on evaluating large language models. Paris is
    definitely becoming an AI hub.
  sec: 918
  time: '15:18'
  who: Isabella
- line: Your LinkedIn profile says you’re currently a self-employed machine learning
    engineer. What are you working on?
  sec: 943
  time: '15:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Freelance Work: Recommendation System & Knowledge Graph Automation'
- line: I’m working full-time as a freelancer. I can’t disclose the company I’m working
    with due to an NDA, but I’m building a recommendation system. Specifically, I’m
    automating the process of generating knowledge graphs for a company, which has
    direct applications in insurance.
  sec: 955
  time: '15:55'
  who: Isabella
- line: It’s quite different from what I’ve done in the past, but I’ve been wanting
    to freelance full-time for a while, so I jumped at the opportunity when it came.
  sec: 955
  time: '15:55'
  who: Isabella
- line: You’ve been freelancing full-time for about three months now, right?
  sec: 994
  time: '16:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, but I’ve done freelancing before, mainly as a data scientist.
  sec: 1000
  time: '16:40'
  who: Isabella
- line: So, you’ve been freelancing for a while, but now your focus has shifted. What
    did you do as a data scientist before?
  sec: 1005
  time: '16:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Before this, I worked on a project for a company that involved aggregating
    and processing georeferenced open-source data. Sometimes we used machine learning,
    but other times it was more rule-based, using classical database merging systems.
    The goal was to generate maps for specific regions of interest. It was very data-focused,
    unlike my current role, which is more model-focused.
  sec: 1017
  time: '16:57'
  who: Isabella
- line: Did you start your career as a freelancer?
  sec: 1058
  time: '17:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I began in a research-based position. I wanted to gain research experience,
    but I realized it wasn’t for me.
  sec: 1060
  time: '17:40'
  who: Isabella
- line: Research is fascinating when you see the final papers and results, but on
    a day-to-day basis, I found it unsatisfying. I prefer engineering, where I can
    work toward a clear deliverable or final product. Freelancing allows me to balance
    both aspects—engineering and a bit of research.
  sec: 1060
  time: '17:40'
  who: Isabella
- line: Did you pursue a PhD while working as a researcher?
  sec: 1120
  time: '18:40'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Pivot: Choosing Engineering Over a PhD'
- line: I started a PhD but decided it wasn’t for me.
  sec: 1132
  time: '18:52'
  who: Isabella
- line: So, after deciding against a PhD, you transitioned to freelancing instead
    of joining a company as a full-time employee. Why?
  sec: 1137
  time: '18:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do at first, so freelancing gave me the opportunity
    to explore. With freelancing, you change projects often, meet new people, and
    experience how different companies operate. That variety and hands-on experience
    were exactly what I wanted.
  sec: 1160
  time: '19:20'
  who: Isabella
- line: Freelancing seems more challenging because you need to find clients, and companies
    usually expect a certain level of experience from freelancers. Wouldn’t it have
    been easier to get a full-time job first? It feels like freelancing is a harder
    path, but you skipped the traditional route entirely. That’s quite interesting.
  sec: 1188
  time: '19:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was a bit stressful to be a freelancer. Sometimes you need to actively
    look for clients, find offers, and contact people. However, I don't think it's
    as difficult as people make it out to be. It's just a different skill set. Looking
    for a traditional job can also be quite challenging.
  sec: 1238
  time: '20:38'
  who: Isabella
- line: Eventually, I want to have a full-time job in a company, but only after gaining
    more hands-on experience. For now, freelancing works well for me because I enjoy
    working on different projects and exploring various topics. Being a freelancer
    allows you to focus on what you can immediately offer a company, and if you like
    learning new technologies, it's a great way to stay up to date. You have the flexibility
    to learn independently and apply new knowledge to your projects right away.
  sec: 1238
  time: '20:38'
  who: Isabella
- line: That's interesting. How did you find your first client? You were doing a PhD,
    realized it wasn't for you, and decided to try freelancing. What was your first
    step?
  sec: 1327
  time: '22:07'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'First Freelance Client: CV Visibility and Networking'
- line: I quit my PhD when I felt it was time. I decided to either look for a job
    or try freelancing. I posted my CV in several places since I was already planning
    to move from Marseille to Lyon.
  sec: 1342
  time: '22:22'
  who: Isabella
- line: One day, while I was at the supermarket, I got a call from someone looking
    for a freelancer. They explained what they needed, and I said yes. A week later,
    I had my first client. It all happened very quickly.
  sec: 1342
  time: '22:22'
  who: Isabella
- line: That’s an interesting story.
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I wish it were more exciting, but it’s pretty straightforward. I optimized
    my LinkedIn profile, posted my CV everywhere, and that was it.
  sec: 1390
  time: '23:10'
  who: Isabella
- line: In a way, that’s a good thing—it shows that it doesn’t have to be overly complicated,
    right?
  sec: 1407
  time: '23:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly.
  sec: 1415
  time: '23:35'
  who: Isabella
- line: You also had a strong profile, right?
  sec: 1417
  time: '23:37'
  who: Alexey
- header: Leveraging Open-Source & AI for Good to Gain Experience
- line: Yes, and I was lucky to have worked on projects outside academia. For example,
    I participated in an AI for Good project coordinated by Antina, which involved
    geospatial technologies. When the client called, I already had relevant experience
    because of that project.
  sec: 1419
  time: '23:39'
  who: Isabella
- line: The same goes for the machine learning part. I had joined a few open-source
    projects to gain more practical experience with machine learning. When the opportunity
    came, I had the skills needed. It was a mix of luck and effort on my part.
  sec: 1419
  time: '23:39'
  who: Isabella
- line: It sounds like more than just a little effort. Balancing an AI for Good project,
    learning new skills, working in academia, and pursuing a PhD is a lot. Finding
    the time and motivation for all of that takes dedication, doesn’t it?
  sec: 1483
  time: '24:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: It does, but open-source work can be so enjoyable that it doesn’t feel like
    effort. Many projects have incredibly passionate and supportive people. That energy
    keeps you motivated and excited to contribute.
  sec: 1513
  time: '25:13'
  who: Isabella
- line: In open source, there’s often less pressure compared to academic settings
    or boot camps. Deadlines and expectations are more flexible, and you can approach
    tasks with a sense of playfulness. You experiment, learn, and share ideas, which
    makes the process much more engaging and fun.
  sec: 1513
  time: '25:13'
  who: Isabella
- line: Can you tell us more about these open-source projects? How did you get involved?
  sec: 1585
  time: '26:25'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Hugging Face Community Course: Computer Vision Contributions & Review'
- line: The first project I got deeply involved in was Hugging Face’s community course
    on computer vision. I stumbled upon it on their Discord server. Someone mentioned
    creating a channel for the project, so I joined. There was a spreadsheet for contributors,
    and I signed up.
  sec: 1590
  time: '26:30'
  who: Isabella
- line: For the next three months, I spent my evenings writing about computer vision,
    reviewing pull requests, and working with others. I made great friends through
    the course—connections I wouldn’t have otherwise.
  sec: 1590
  time: '26:30'
  who: Isabella
- line: The AI for Good project happened because someone I met through this course
    invited me. That led to more connections and other interesting projects. Once
    you know people with shared passions, ideas naturally flow.
  sec: 1590
  time: '26:30'
  who: Isabella
- line: It sounds like the key takeaway is to be active in communities and open to
    opportunities. You see something that resonates, jump in, and participate.
  sec: 1722
  time: '28:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. It can feel scary at first, but once you take the initial step, you
    realize it’s manageable.
  sec: 1742
  time: '29:02'
  who: Isabella
- line: Especially with community projects, starting something new can be daunting.
    But working alongside others provides structure. You take one step at a time,
    and it becomes clear what to do next.
  sec: 1755
  time: '29:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. In a community, people naturally take on roles. Some focus on
    editing and organizing ideas, while others track deadlines. Personally, I’m not
    great at deadlines outside of work, so I really appreciate it when someone keeps
    us on schedule.
  sec: 1778
  time: '29:38'

    you have a broader role?
  sec: 1821
  time: '30:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: I worked mostly on the first module, which covered the basics of computer
    vision and image processing—how computers even "see" images, and the classical
    techniques used. Later on, I became a reviewer for the course. We reviewed many
    of the other units. The course was structured so that once everyone finished their
    work, they made a pull request. Then, there were a lot of pull requests to review,
    so we would step in when available. I also contributed to sections like "Introduction
    to Transfer Learning." By the time I joined, most of the advanced topics were
    already taken, and the introductory topics were still open. So, I worked on one
    of those.

    degree and the beginning of my academic career involved computer vision. So, I
    was already quite familiar with it.
  sec: 1889

    course like that, so you don't feel like an imposter?
  sec: 1903
  time: '31:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Teaching & Communication: Simplifying ML Jargon for Learners'
- line: That's a great question. I was very comfortable with the topic I worked on,
    but there were definitely people with less experience than me. They did a great
    job, though. Sometimes they would ask, "I don't understand this. Can you recommend
    a paper or a book to help?" Even if they weren't experts in the field, they put
    in the effort to research. And since there was always someone more knowledgeable,
    we were able to guide each other and review each other's work. There were also
    people reviewing the pull requests, which helped catch mistakes or clarify things.
    So, while not all topics are beginner-friendly, I believe there's always a part
    of a project that is.
  sec: 1917
  time: '31:57'
  who: Isabella
- line: Right. And when you're experienced in a topic like computer vision, some things
    might seem obvious to you, and you might not take the time to explain them. But
    someone with a fresh perspective might find it confusing and ask how you transitioned
    from one concept to another.
  sec: 1975
  time: '32:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. That's one of the things I love about teaching. When you work on
    something every day, you forget that what you find intuitive might not be obvious
    to others. When students ask questions, it makes you realize that not everyone
    has the same level of knowledge. It forces you to slow down and explain things
    more clearly. Also, machine learning has a lot of jargon, and sometimes terms
    are used interchangeably when they don't need to be. For someone starting out,
    it's especially important to break things down simply and clearly.
  sec: 2007
  time: '33:27'
  who: Isabella
- line: Let's say I want to find a project to contribute to—perhaps an open-source
    project. Where would you suggest looking for these opportunities? Could it be
    random communities, or are there specific places where people can get involved?
  sec: 2051
  time: '34:11'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Finding Open-Source Opportunities: Communities, Docs, and Local Chapters'
- line: Well, first, if you use a specific open-source model or library, they likely
    have a Slack or Discord community. A good place to start is by joining those and
    seeing what others are working on. You can also check out the issues on GitHub.
    Often, there are easy issues to fix. If you're using a library regularly, you
    may spot something that's not optimal, and you could open an issue or propose
    a fix. Just be polite and open about it, and things will work out. Another good
    place is documentation. Sometimes, projects explicitly ask for contributions to
    documentation, which is a great place to start because everyone wants to contribute
    to the code, but no one wants to write documentation. Starting there can give
    you a good experience. On the community side, I think Omten A is a good place
    to look for projects. They organize local chapters where you can get hands-on
    experience with a machine learning project in a low-pressure environment. Training
    is usually provided in these courses, and everyone works together to review a
    couple of notebooks. I think those are two good places to begin.
  sec: 2081
  time: '34:41'
  who: Isabella
- line: When I think of contributing to open-source, I usually think of tools like
    Scikit-learn, Pandas, or NumPy. When someone says, "You can contribute to open-source,"
    I think, "Okay, I'll go to the GitHub issues for Scikit-learn and fix something."
    But now, after hearing you talk about contributing to open-source projects, I
    realize there are different kinds of projects—it's not just about working on tools,
    but using those tools to solve other problems.
  sec: 2204
  time: '36:44'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Types of Open-Source Projects: Code, Data, and Applied Solutions'
- line: Exactly. Open-source has many dimensions. There are open-source codebases,
    open-source data, and open-source tools. Contributing to open-source tools is
    great, but it's also one of the most overwhelming places to start. If you look
    at a big library like NumPy and check out their issues, you’ll often see that
    someone else is already working on it. That doesn't mean you can't contribute,
    but the smaller libraries are often more welcoming to new contributors. Open-source
    data is also overlooked, but it’s valuable. If you can contribute to a project
    with open-source code, data, and a final product, that’s something really special.
  sec: 2246
  time: '37:26'
  who: Isabella
- line: You mentioned the community course on Hugging Face. I assume it was also an
    open-source project, which is very close to what we do at DataTalks.Club. We use
    GitHub for our courses, so everyone can contribute. While it's not open-source
    in the same way as a tool like Pandas, it’s still open for learning and contribution.
  sec: 2303
  time: '38:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it's great. I’ve participated in some boot camps, mostly for specific
    models I was interested in. I really appreciate it because finding good, reliable
    sources of information has become more difficult. If you search something on Google,
    the first pages are often filled with entries that look like they were generated
    by AI, and they’re not very helpful. But when you find content made by people
    who truly understand the topic and put in the effort, it really stands out.
  sec: 2334
  time: '38:54'
  who: Isabella
- line: Right. And when it comes to projects, we talked about courses. You mentioned
    that one of the places you found your project was through Omten A, right?
  sec: 2371
  time: '39:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that’s where I found my project. Actually, one of the people I met during
    the first project invited me to organize another chapter with her. In December,
    we’ll be organizing a chapter on Green Space Segmentation in Frankfurt. If anyone
    is interested, they’re welcome to join us. I’d be happy to welcome them!

- line: What exactly is that?
  sec: 2412
  time: '40:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s essentially identifying areas like gardens or forests in the city. For
    example, using satellite images, we can identify green spaces. The most commonly
    used satellite for this is Sentinel-2, which orbits Earth and provides free images.
    There are also high-quality drone images available. The challenge is processing
    these images to create a segmentation map of the city—identifying where the gardens,
    forests, and other green spaces are. The goal is to map this back to ground truth
    data. Right now, we're benchmarking different strategies, from CNNs to transformer-based
    approaches, to see which one works best. It’s a bit ambitious, but we want to
    find a solution that’s both effective and practical.
  sec: 2412
  time: '40:12'
  who: Isabella
- line: The issue is that sometimes research models perform well in theory, but in
    real life, they’re not as usable because they require a lot of computational resources.
    For example, if predicting one image takes an entire day, it becomes unfeasible
    for most people. Our aim is to get the green space map out there, but we also
    want to find a way that others can replicate it in other cities efficiently.

    With platforms like Dina, there’s no expectation of working long hours. You can
    contribute a few hours a week, maybe after work or during the weekend, and collaborate
    with others to solve the problem. It’s a great way to learn new skills without

- header: 'Soft Skills from Collaboration: Communication and Prioritization'
- line: Exactly. There are many ways to build your portfolio. But as I’ve grown in
    my career, I’ve realized that employers also look for soft skills. They don’t
    just want someone who’s great at their job but can’t work well with others. When
    you work on these projects, you naturally pick up soft skills. If 80 people are
    working on the same project, you need to communicate effectively, stay organized,
    and manage your time. It's a great way to learn how to navigate situations like
    receiving a lot of messages at once and figuring out how to prioritize tasks.
    These are critical skills in engineering and data science. The mindset you bring
    to the job is just as important as your technical skills.
  sec: 2608

    But on a project, there are people with experience who can guide you, right?
  sec: 2671
  time: '44:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. You get to work with people who have more technical expertise,
    and in applied projects, experts in the field often join to help. For instance,
    in a previous project on grass segmentation, we worked with people who specialized
    in grass monitoring. They were eager to help because it also benefited their work.
    It’s a great environment because you're exposed to people with different types
    of expertise.

    get insights is to reach out to someone with that job title on LinkedIn and ask
    them questions. It might be intimidating, but worst case, they don’t reply. Best
    case, you get some great advice. In projects like Dina, communication is more
    informal, so it’s easier to ask, “What do you actually do in your job? What does
    a typical day look like?” This kind of direct interaction is valuable because
    many people entering data science don’t fully understand the different roles,
    and job titles can be confusing.

    and eventually, the number of active participants drops from 80 to 25?
  sec: 2874

    part of the nature of these projects.

    and those who leave often return when they have a better understanding of what’s
    involved. It’s okay to step away if your circumstances change. There's no penalty
    for realizing you can’t commit, but you still gain valuable experience from the
    project. Realistic expectations are key.
  sec: 2909

    people want to contribute but don’t know the terms. For example, a complete beginner
    might not know what "push to the branch" means. You have to be clear and patient.
    Some people need more guidance, and that's fine. I once worked with a 17-year-old
    student who didn’t know where to start, so I asked him to look up five models
    on the Hugging Face hub and check their performance. He didn’t mind doing this
    because he had the time, and in the process, he learned a lot. It’s a great way
    to collaborate and learn from each other.

- line: Yes, that's true. But in my experience, especially since I also teach AI,
    I’ve found that when people go too deep into ChatGPT, they get less out of it.
    For example, if you ask it a very advanced question, like how to validate a segmentation
    model, ChatGPT will give you an advanced answer even if you ask it to simplify.
    It's about vocabulary and understanding—the answer might be there, but you might
    not fully understand it.
  sec: 3094
  time: '51:34'
  who: Isabella
- line: I experience this problem myself. When I’m working on things I’m familiar
    with, the answers usually make sense because I already have the foundational knowledge.
    But for things I’m new to, like Arduino, which involves hardware, ChatGPT sometimes
    gives me advanced answers that I can’t apply. I end up needing to break things
    down step by step and ask a lot of questions. After having ten separate chats,
    it gets overwhelming.
  sec: 3129

    and I had an issue with my audio. I asked ChatGPT how to fix it, but it gave me
    terrible advice. I thought, “Okay, this isn’t helpful.” I had to go look for forums
    or better sources.

    on women in data, which is a broad field—everything from data analysis and visualization
    to machine learning. It’s something I’ve been reflecting on for a while, especially
    after working with Denny in the past. Around Christmas last year, I thought about
    doing something similar again, and I started researching women in data. I realized
    the best way to contribute was by sharing stories of women working in the field.
    So, on the Substack, we interview women in data science and machine learning,
    asking how they got started, what they’ve learned, what they like about their
    jobs, and what advice they have. We’ve been doing this for about 10 months, since
    launching in January.

    definitely connect with her.
  sec: 3363

    more accessible. When you do group work, it can get messy after a while, and people
    change their schedules. So, I wanted to do something that would have a broader
    impact. It’s also a way for me to give back to the community and amplify more

    lot of skepticism at the beginning. She had to prove that the tool worked and
    that you could use it for automated data analysis. Over time, people reached out
    to her to learn more and even invited her to workshops. Our second-to-last issue
    covered a woman working in fake news detection, a project she developed as part
    of a Google fellowship. We've featured a variety of profiles, including someone
    who works in AI ethics and sustainability. She spoke about how AI was once seen
    as experimental, lacking mathematical rigor. Back then, people didn’t take AI
    seriously, but that’s certainly changed now. One of the most touching stories
