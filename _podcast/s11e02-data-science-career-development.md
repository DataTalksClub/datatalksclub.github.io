title: Data Science Career Development
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about data science career development. We have a special
    guest today, Katie. Am I pronouncing it correctly? Katie?
  sec: 93
  time: '1:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, Katie. Katie Bauer.
  sec: 103
  time: '1:43'
  who: Katie
- line: '[chuckles] Hi, Katie. Katie is a data science leader known for her writing
    and thinking about data careers and managing effective data teams. She is currently
    the head of data at GlossGenius. [cross-talk]'
  sec: 105
  time: '1:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: There’s another tongue twister. [chuckles]
  sec: 119
  time: '1:59'
  who: Katie
- line: GlossGenius [chuckles] Katie is leading software platforms for beauty professionals
    in the US salon and studio space. Previously, she was on Twitter's infrastructure
    team and responsible for the analytics organization. I think you also worked at
    Twitter and a bunch of other places. Welcome.
  sec: 123
  time: '2:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you for having me. I’m very excited about this conversation today.
  sec: 143
  time: '2:23'
  who: Katie
- header: Katie’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of developing a data science career, let's
    start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 147
  time: '2:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. Like a lot of people who ended up working in data science in the early
    20-teens, I originally got into the field because I was looking for a way to not
    have an academic career. [chuckles] I was going to be a linguist for a while,
    and then decided that I would rather do something different for a little bit.
    I thought maybe I would go back but I ended up not doing it. I came out to the
    Bay Area after finishing school to work in tech and the role I ended up in, ended
    up being very data-centric. Over time, I just kind of became an all-purpose data
    person.
  sec: 159
  time: '2:39'
  who: Katie
- line: I started off as a business analyst, did a lot of report building and automation,
    improved my coding skills and eventually became a data scientist. I’ve worked
    on production ad targeting algorithms and then eventually made my way over to
    social media for a large part of my career. I was one of the first data scientists
    at Reddit. I was there for a long time as an individual contributor and eventually
    became a manager, working mostly on consumer product concerns there. Then, I eventually
    moved over to Twitter, where I ran a small organization focused on the infrastructure
    organization, and really kind of measuring the ROI on the company's technology
    decisions.
  sec: 159
  time: '2:39'
  who: Katie
- line: Throughout all of that I've been very self-reflective, I guess [chuckles]
    spent a lot of time thinking about careers and all the different forms and shapes
    they can take. I've watched my peers make a lot of choices that were different
    from me as well. I have really come to believe that data is its own distinct career
    path and it has a lot of different ways in and a lot of different ways out that
    are unique to it. You don't really see the same sorts of things in PM careers
    or software engineering careers.
  sec: 159
  time: '2:39'
  who: Katie
- line: Right now, you're not in social media anymore? Or are you?
  sec: 273
  time: '4:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. [laughs]
  sec: 276
  time: '4:36'
  who: Katie
- line: GlossGenius is not in social media.
  sec: 278
  time: '4:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it's a B2B SaaS company – sort of a mixture of B2B SaaS and payments.
    It is software that helps individual (and I guess now teams) salon owners to run
    their business. It does a lot of back office stuff, helps them manage appointments,
    schedules, take payments – it's something that really allows them to focus on
    the artistry of what they do and not have to worry about the admin. It's something
    that actually gives people a lot of social mobility, too. It's a really good company
    from a social standpoint.
  sec: 281
  time: '4:41'
  who: Katie
- line: It's interesting to see how SaaS businesses develop. There is some very generic
    software, but it's not really well-tailored to the needs of a specific niche,
    like beauty salons. So then there are companies like yours that appear and help
    in this industry. That's really cool. And what do you do there as the head of
    data? It's the head of data, right?
  sec: 316
  time: '5:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That is my title – the head of data. Broadly, my job is making sure
    that the company is getting the most out of its data. Data is a strategically
    valuable asset and it's something that can both be used to improve the operation
    of the company, and also to potentially deliver value directly to the company's
    customers. Right now, I am in the process of building a best-in-class data team.
    I am hiring, so if anyone is interested in coming to work for this company, you
    should let me know. But the main focus right now is really kind of getting the
    team stood up, maturing our operations, and then figuring out how we would grow
    and scale and make GlossGenius a better company.
  sec: 340
  time: '5:40'
  who: Katie
- line: Who are you hiring? What kind of roles?
  sec: 382
  time: '6:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Product analysts, marketing scientists and analysts, and analytics engineers.
    So lots of different things.
  sec: 385
  time: '6:25'
  who: Katie
- line: How many was it? You said them quite fast? I understood product analysts,
    analytics engineers and marketers – marketing analysts. Right?
  sec: 391
  time: '6:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, someone who's going to mostly work on data problems related to marketing
    and go-to-market. But statistical skills are especially important in that role.
    For anyone who's involved in this space, attribution has gotten more complicated
    over the past couple of years because of iOS tracking changes. So we definitely
    need someone with good statistical jobs for that role.
  sec: 405
  time: '6:45'
  who: Katie
- header: What is a data scientist?
- line: You don't have any data scientists yet, do you?
  sec: 428
  time: '7:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we're not using that title for now, no. I mean, this is something that
    I could go on about – what exactly “data scientist” means is always an interesting
    question.
  sec: 431
  time: '7:11'
  who: Katie
- line: So what does it mean to you?
  sec: 442
  time: '7:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it's a bit more of a term like “software engineer”. It's kind of a
    broad cover term that can describe a lot of different roles. I've had “data science”
    in my title for most of my career and it's been completely different at every
    company I've worked for. At one point, I was productionizing ML algorithms – I
    have done what a lot of people call “analyst work” under that title. I have written
    data pipelines and done a lot of data engineering under that title.
  sec: 446
  time: '7:26'
  who: Katie
- line: To me, it's more of a description of a broad category of things, and it gives
    you a good idea of what someone is not doing. But it doesn't necessarily tell
    you the specifics. A lot of times, you have to get that more contextually from
    understanding the company, its maturity, the stage of the team – there are a lot
    of other things that give you better ideas of what specifically you will be doing.
  sec: 446
  time: '7:26'
  who: Katie
- line: There's already a question, “How do we apply for a role in your company?”
    I guess you have a ‘careers’ page, right?
  sec: 494
  time: '8:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: We do. If you Google, “GlossGenius careers” you'll probably find it. You can
    also send me a message on Twitter or you can send me a DM on LinkedIn.
  sec: 500
  time: '8:20'
  who: Katie
- header: What is a data science manager?
- line: Well, we just talked about data scientists and you said that this is quite
    an ambiguous term – it can mean anything. Or maybe not ambiguous, but broad, as
    you said. It can mean anything and it usually describes what people don't do rather
    than what they do. But what do data science managers do in this case?
  sec: 513
  time: '8:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: That is a very good question. In some ways, being a data science manager is
    not that different from being a manager for a technical role of any sort. You're
    responsible for building a team that is able to meet your organization's needs
    and solve certain types of problems. A lot of advice that you hear for engineering
    managers can apply to data science management, or data management, analytics management,
    whatever term you want to use. I'm probably going to use the term “data science
    management” for the rest of this conversation.
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Katie
- line: There are particular aspects of the way data teams are organized and the way
    people add value as data scientists that mean you have to approach things differently
    as a data science manager. One of those is – I think one of the biggest constraints,
    really, for people who are running data science teams is that the details in the
    domain context matter a ton. It is really hard to give good specific advice to
    a cross-functional person if you don't really understand their domain, or if you're
    a manager. It's really hard to give someone good specific feedback on their work
    if you're not familiar with the domain. That is a constraint that I think impacts
    data science teams more than almost any other type of technical team. You usually
    have to know the business – you need to have good context for how things work,
    how the company makes money, what you need users to do to make money.
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Katie
- line: That ends up creating an unusual structure on data teams, where you have what
    is often referred to as an “embedded model,” where someone on your data team might
    report to a data science manager or some other kind of data leader, but their
    day-to-day decisions are very informed by who they're working with cross-functionally.
    You may have analysts or data scientists go sit with a product team and essentially
    be a part of that team – a lot of what they do day-to-day is determined by a “dotted
    line manager”. That's someone who is probably a product manager or an engineering
    manager, or like a person in marketing or something – who assigns them tasks,
    or helps negotiate tasks with them.
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Katie
- line: Then the data science manager is someone who is broadly responsible for the
    quality of the craft of data science, and the career growth of a data scientist.
    Another term for this that you hear a lot is a “matrix organization,” where you
    have, essentially, a horizontal team that then goes and sits with certain verticals.
    Another complicated part of this [chuckles] is that if you are a data science
    manager whose team spans many verticals, it can be kind of hard for you to know
    all the details of what everyone is doing. But there are ways of getting around
    that, I suppose.
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Katie
- header: Quality of the craft
- line: In summary – we have, usually, let's say there is a data scientist, or just
    a data professional, embedded in the team. You mentioned this matrix structure
    where this person has a data leader/data science manager and then there is a “dotted
    line manager” – some other manager, usually a product manager or engineering manager.
    And the role of a data leader/data science manager is to help with the quality
    of the craft and career growth. I think we will probably spend most of the interview
    today talking about career growth.
  sec: 718
  time: '11:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: But before that, I wanted to ask you about the first thing – the quality of
    the craft. What does that mean?
  sec: 718
  time: '11:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is something I encounter every now and then, working with maybe a product
    manager. They mostly care about having something they can use as a basis for a
    decision. For them, data is some sort of end product – maybe it's a dashboard,
    it's a report, a model – they receive something. And for them, they don't really
    care how it was created. That's not important to them. But as a data science manager,
    it is your job to make sure it's made well, it's made in a way that's maintainable,
    and it's made in a way that will scale. Those are things that you, as a data science
    manager, are probably responsible for more than almost anyone else.
  sec: 760
  time: '12:40'
  who: Katie
- line: Let's say, the person that you're managing builds a bunch of stuff, they work
    in a domain for a while, and then they go do something else – maybe they leave
    the company, maybe they get promoted into a higher role, maybe they change to
    a different domain. As the manager, you're then responsible for whatever they’ve
    built and you better hope that it was made well [chuckles] because you're going
    to have to either take it over yourself or find someone else to take it over who
    doesn't necessarily have context. Making sure that things are done well and documented
    well, that's also a responsibility for a data science manager that you probably
    should take pretty seriously. But it's not something that other people necessarily
    have the job of thinking about.
  sec: 760
  time: '12:40'
  who: Katie
- line: So it's more like quality control rather than actually going there and making
    sure it's scalable. It's more like, “Okay, I think here this thing will not scale.”
    Or “You might be missing a piece of documentation there.” Things like this, right?
    You might have some sort of a checklist and you go through each point “Okay, we're
    missing this line here. How do we go about fixing that?” Is that right?
  sec: 846
  time: '14:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, just a kind of oversight. You can do it in a lot of different ways.
    Maybe sometimes it's a checklist, maybe sometimes it's setting up a process of
    peer review so that other people have context or can give feedback on something
    – it could be a teammate of that person. But you are responsible for making sure
    that things are done well.
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Katie
- line: Okay, so it's more like establishing a process and then as a part of this
    process, it could be a checklist, it could be a review or any other way of getting
    there. So the job of the manager in this case is making sure that the process
    is there and people follow this process. Right?
  sec: 893
  time: '14:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Doing things to ensure a high level of quality.
  sec: 907
  time: '15:07'
  who: Katie
- header: How data leaders promote career growth
- line: The second point in the responsibilities of data leaders was career growth.
    A big chunk of the responsibilities is to make sure people grow. How do the managers
    usually do this? What kind of tools and processes…? There are probably processes
    for that as well, right? What do they usually do to help people grow?
  sec: 912
  time: '15:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I think the first thing that you should think about when you're a manager
    trying to support someone in career growth is taking inventory of where they are
    at that point in their career. The first dimension you should think about is whether
    they are junior or senior. “Junior” and “senior” might be a literal title that
    your company has, but I'm not going to use it that way in this conversation, just
    because it may mean different things at different companies.
  sec: 938
  time: '15:38'
  who: Katie
- line: There are probably levels within junior and senior that would be meaningful,
    potentially. But those are the two buckets I'm probably going to speak about in
    this conversation. When I say junior, I really mean someone who is still learning
    how to be a data scientist, whereas a senior person has reached what is called
    a “career level” or a “terminal level” – these are terms that are sometimes used
    in management circles to refer to someone who has learned… level.
  sec: 938
  time: '15:38'
  who: Katie
- line: Terminal level… Sounds very strange. [chuckles]
  sec: 997
  time: '16:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, [chuckle] that one sounds a little dangerous, or lethal. But it's really
    where someone has reached a level that – they know how to be a data scientist.
    They can mostly operate autonomously and make good decisions – you don't have
    to necessarily be too involved in their day-to-day work. Once you reach that level,
    at a lot of companies, they're fine with you staying there forever. You can still
    get raises every year for merit or cost of living adjustments, but you're not
    required to grow to a new level. Whereas a lot of times… [cross-talk]
  sec: 999
  time: '16:39'
  who: Katie
- line: That’s what “terminal” usually means, right?
  sec: 1033
  time: '17:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that's what I mean. It's kind of the “end of the ladder”. There may be
    levels… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1036
  time: '17:16'
  who: Katie
- line: So they’re no longer expecting you to grow. For example, a junior is expected
    to grow. If a junior is not growing, then maybe there is a problem. But for a
    senior, it's fine to stay a senior forever.
  sec: 1040
  time: '17:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. There are lots of levels that you could go beyond senior. One of the
    things that's very interesting about reaching a senior point in your career is
    that you really start getting forking paths at the senior level. There's kind
    of only one way to grow as a junior – it's to become a senior. But when you're
    a senior, you have so many other options. You could become a people manager, you
    could start growing into kind of a technical leadership track role – a staff senior,
    staff principle, distinguished – these mean particular things at different companies.
    But they're often something that becomes leadership, but specifically through
    a technical lens.
  sec: 1053
  time: '17:33'
  who: Katie
- line: Another thing that happens a lot for people who hit their career level, or
    their terminal level, is that they end up going and exploring adjacent careers.
    They might go and be a PM, they might become some kind of software engineer, they
    could be a TPM – there are other things that people often branch into. But at
    any rate, the first thing you should think about when you're a manager trying
    to work with someone on career growth is, “Where are they?” Because people need
    very different things, depending on where they are.
  sec: 1053
  time: '17:33'
  who: Katie
- header: Supporting senior data professionals
- line: I guess for a senior, as you mentioned, they're quite independent, they’re
    at the “terminal level” – we are no longer expecting them to grow. But I guess
    people still… they do this data science thing quite well and maybe they have been
    doing this for a couple of years already. And maybe it becomes boring, right?
    The job of a manager is also to keep an eye on this and also help seniors develop.
    Is that right? [Katie agrees]
  sec: 1130
  time: '18:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: So what kind of support do seniors need? From what I see, seniors are technical
    experts on a project – they know everything, they know how to do everything, how
    to fix anything, they help juniors, they talk to product managers. But still,
    even they require some support. Right?
  sec: 1130
  time: '18:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. There are a couple of different ways you can think about it. There is
    the path of a generalist versus a specialist. That's one type of growth that you
    could start thinking about once you hit a senior point in your career. Generalists,
    of course, will be broadly knowledgeable of a lot of different things in the company,
    or maybe a lot of different techniques that are relevant. Specialists, maybe deep
    dive on a particular type of modeling, for example. At a company that does a lot
    of experimentation, or as complicated things like network effects that they need
    to factor in, you could become a causal inference specialist, for example, as
    a form of career growth. That is a thing that you can go very, very deep on.
  sec: 1186
  time: '19:46'
  who: Katie
- line: If I had to give a general purpose piece of advice about growing the career
    of a senior person – very frequently, the thing that you need to do as a manager
    is help them move up levels of abstraction and thinking, and help them see bigger
    picture things a bit more. This has certainly been true of me at different points
    in my career. I also think it's true for management careers – it can be very easy
    to get focused on your day-to-day, be very immersed in the details and not remember
    to take a step back and think about, “Why are we doing this in the first place?”
    Or, “What is the next step of this?” Or, “What are three steps ahead?” Or even
    trying to understand organizationally where what you're doing fits in.
  sec: 1186
  time: '19:46'
  who: Katie
- line: This is something that, if you are trying to grow the career of a senior person,
    is very important to focus on. It can be very easy to just go and do stuff that
    you know and one of the hardest things to do is step back and realize that there's
    a bunch of stuff happening just slightly outside of your space that you might
    be able to add value in that arena or you might have a perspective that's useful,
    or it's just something that you should be aware of because it might impact what
    you're doing right now.
  sec: 1186
  time: '19:46'
  who: Katie
- line: As a manager, how do you help seniors take a step back? What you mentioned
    is that we need to help seniors ask themselves, “Why are they doing what they're
    doing? How does it affect the business in general?” So how do we help them do
    this?
  sec: 1310
  time: '21:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: The two biggest tools I see in a manager's toolkit, in this case, is to increase
    their exposure to leadership and to delegate things to them, whether they think
    they're ready or not. In terms of exposing them to higher levels of leadership,
    or just bigger scope problems, sometimes that is just… Well, before I get into
    this, I'll say that there is definitely a phenomenon that you experience a lot
    as a manager, where something is happening broadly in the company that is not
    quite decided yet and because it is not decided, the thing that people are talking
    about maybe doing – they may reverse their thinking.
  sec: 1333
  time: '22:13'
  who: Katie
- line: Sometimes if a manager seems like they're not talking about something that
    you know is going on, but you can't really figure out what it is, it's probably
    because there's a decision that needs to be made that hasn't been made yet. You
    don't want to tell someone that the decision has been made because then you might
    have to backtrack, and then it's just stressful for no reason. One type of way
    that you start growing senior people is exposing them to some of this ambiguity
    and complexity and helping them learn how to understand it, sit with it, and navigate
    it. Which a lot of times, it's just actually bringing them into situations that
    they've not been in before – making sure you give them a lot of context so they
    understand it constructively, and asking them what they think. Asking them to
    weigh in and preparing them to participate constructively in those environments.
    Some people would think of this as getting people involved in politics, maybe.
  sec: 1333
  time: '22:13'
  who: Katie
- line: “Politics” is also kind of a bad word for what is really just having good
    relationships at the company. Getting senior people to invest in relationships
    with cross-functional peers, with data scientists on other teams who are senior
    – this is a big way to start exposing people to different concerns and different
    levels of abstraction in problems that the company is trying to solve. When it
    comes to delegation – and this one is scary sometimes to do to people on your
    team [chuckles] – a lot of times, as a manager, you are told that your team needs
    to solve a problem. And it can be very vaguely stated, to the point where you,
    as a manager, are not even sure where to start. Even with your context, even with
    your experience. It can be tempting to try and “shield” the team, for lack of
    a better word, by trying to do a lot of that scoping yourself.
  sec: 1333
  time: '22:13'
  who: Katie
- line: One of the best things you can do as a manager is give that to a senior person
    and ask them to start solving that problem. You're giving them responsibility.
    And there are constructive ways to give them responsibility. [chuckles] You don't
    want to just give them some completely open-ended thing that they're not prepared
    for at all. But by giving them responsibility, you are giving them a gift. You
    are giving them the opportunity to be the owner of something that is important.
    It's also important for you, as a manager, to delegate more because that is part
    of how you grow – by growing leaders beneath you.
  sec: 1333

- line: I was about to ask you about juniors, but I noticed that we have had a highly
    upvoted question about choosing the next step for a senior. The question is, “As
    a senior data scientist, how should they think about my future career path? Choosing
    the IC route – lead or staff – versus the management route (data science manager)?”
    What would you suggest? How can you decide if management is for me, or I want
    to be a technical person?
  sec: 1554
  time: '25:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, one thing I'll say is, a lot of career choices at the senior level are
    reversible. So it's okay to go and try something for a little bit. You could go
    try being a manager for a couple of years and if it turns out that it's not for
    you, you can very easily go back to being a senior data scientist, and you be
    a better senior data scientist for having for having been a manager because you'll
    understand a bit more about how organizations work. There is a really good article
    about this phenomenon by Charity Majors of HoneyComb. She's an engineer rather
    than a data scientist, but I think this concept applies. It's called the IC Manager
    Pendulum. I highly recommend it – a very, very good article on this subject.

- line: All of this is to say, if you choose to try management, it is not like a permanent
    decision – you can always go back. But if you want to try out management before
    you actually make that jump, I highly recommend finding ways to essentially be
    responsible for other people and seeing how much you like it. A very common form
    of this is mentorship. Maybe it is an intern that you are responsible for a summer,
    or a more junior person on your team that you lead on a project. And in general,
    leading big projects with more than one contributor is a very good way for you
    to try out being responsible for other people's productivity. This is a thing
    that people don't always think about when they're thinking about becoming a manager
    – sometimes you tell people what to do and they don't listen to you [chuckles]
    and learning how to deal with that constructively.
  sec: 1587
  time: '26:27'
  who: Katie
- line: Not even that you give people orders… It maybe sounds like that's what I'm
    saying – but it's more like “How do you get people excited about work that needs
    to be done and see it as the opportunity that it hopefully actually is?” Or I
    guess if it's just boilerplate work that needs to get done, help them understand
    the value of it, even if it's not exciting and help them feel appreciated for
    having done it. That's really good experience if you're considering people management,
    because there's a lot of things about people management that aren't fun. [chuckles]
    Sometimes it's project management – it's something you're going to have to do
    a lot if you go on the management track so you should definitely explore it if
    you have the opportunity to, at your company.

    there is (as far as I remember) you join a company as a senior, you grow to a
    manager, then you leave the company, you join another company as a senior you
    grow to a manager and you keep doing this until you get tired. Right?
  sec: 1752
  time: '29:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it can be at the same company, too. I've seen people that I've worked
    with step into a management role, they do it for a couple years, and then maybe
    for whatever reason, they decide they want to go back to doing IC work. It might
    be that they have a kid, they want to have a little less responsibility while
    they're sorting out their personal life, it may just be that they have an itch
    to get back to doing hands-on work, and that's a great reason too. There are lots
    of different reasons why you would switch but between the two. It's good to do
    – it keeps your technical skills sharp but you're never too far away from understanding
    how managers think either.

- line: I guess most of the time managers spend not managing seniors, but rather managing
    juniors, right? From my experience, juniors usually need more support. Seniors
    are pretty independent and we need to help them grow, but juniors require more
    support. Maybe let’s start with juniors – how can we manage them? What does it
    actually require for a manager to manage a junior?
  sec: 1810
  time: '30:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I do think you're right to say they require more support. That support
    doesn't always need to come from the manager. I actually think sometimes it's
    good when it comes from other people on the team.

  sec: 1859
  time: '30:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, pretty much. This is a great org design technique if you have the option
    at your company – you spin up a new domain for data scientists to work in, you
    put a senior person there first, and then you add a junior person second, because
    then the senior person can grow from mentoring the junior person and the junior
    person gets a lot of day-to-day support from the senior person. But juniors need
    more support, as you're saying, and thinking about the types of support, I think,
    is maybe a good way to start digging into working with junior people. Since they're
    still learning the craft, there will be a lot of skills-based support that they
    need.
  sec: 1860
  time: '31:00'
  who: Katie
- line: I strongly encourage you, if your company has a career ladder, to look at
    what those things are and have a conversation with the junior people about where
    they are on different competencies. That's a very good way to kind of give them
    more objective criteria. It might be, “Okay, this person needs to learn this programming
    language better or they need to learn how to structure a data pipeline, or maybe
    they need to learn some stat skills.” As a manager [cross-talk]
  sec: 1860
  time: '31:00'
  who: Katie
- line: That's a bit difficult for juniors. Usually juniors come from university with
    a lot of the good, let's say, “modeling skills”, so they know machine learning
    well. But when it comes to all these data pipelines and so on, usually what universities
    do not prepare them to do is those tests and pipelines and so on.
  sec: 1939
  time: '32:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, definitely. There are a lot of boilerplate technical things that they
    just need to learn. And one of the best ways to help people learn that is to give
    them projects where it's required for them to learn that because then it's part
    of their job to learn that thing so it's very easy to make time for it. Another
    big thing that juniors often need to learn, which is kind of what you're getting
    at as well, is how companies work. That's a little bit harder to teach people.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 1963
  time: '32:43'
  who: Katie
- line: A lot of times, actually, as you're talking about different people on a project
    that they're working with, like, “What is that person's role? What type of role
    is that? Like, if they're working with product managers, talking to them a bit
    about, “Well, this is the type of thing that product managers do for a company.
    These are the ways in which they're evaluated, like helping understand their incentives
    and their mental models and why they make the choices that they do.”
  sec: 1963
  time: '32:43'
  who: Katie
- line: That's a very important thing to talk to juniors about, as well. I definitely
    know, early in my career, product managers would make choices that I found absolutely
    baffling and if someone had just explained to me, like “Product managers were
    trying to hit XYZ goal by this amount of time. Ultimately, the thing for them
    is that they need to hit this goal because it enables some other thing we need
    to do in a subsequent quarter.” [chuckles] I would have understood so much better
    how to work with product managers. But no one did that for me. So I think this
    is an important thing as well. [cross-talk]

- line: How do you actually do this? At the company where I work, a junior data scientist
    joined recently. Usually, as a part of the onboarding process, she talked to me
    and then one thing she asked is “How can I grow faster in this company? How can
    I learn better how the company works?” I got puzzled by this, like, “Okay, this
    is not something that juniors usually ask me.” So I was like, “Okay. Well, what
    should I tell her?” What I ended up telling her was something similar to what
    you just said, which is funny.
  sec: 2056

    tell her how exactly to do this. Now I maybe have a chance to ask you, so the
    next time somebody asks me how to do this, I have an answer. [Katie laughs] So
    how should they actually talk to product managers and find out what their incentives
    are and how they make their decisions?
  sec: 2056
  time: '34:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, product managers are people, so you can just ask them to do
    a virtual coffee or a real-life coffee, if you have that option. Just ask them,
    like, “Hey, I'm new here. I'm still learning about this company and about product
    managers. I would love to have a chat with you to learn about your job here and
    learn about your career.” It's something that people usually like to talk about
    and they like being helpful.
  sec: 2114
  time: '35:14'
  who: Katie
- line: Usually, if you give people that context and just say that you want to learn
    about them and what they're doing, they're happy to talk to you about that. You
    could even do a recurring meeting with someone who you work with regularly. That's
    a great way to build a relationship. Find a frequency that actually fits in with
    your schedule, make sure you've got time for deep work, and you have something
    to say. But just building a relationship with those people and talking to them
    about work can teach you a lot about how they think.
  sec: 2114

    manager gave me a piece of advice that I should talk to senior leadership – senior
    product managers, product directors – and ask them what their problems are. And
    the problem that I have is, they are such important people. They're always busy.
    How do I even start? We have a meeting and then it's this awkward silence. What
    do I even tell them?
  sec: 2174
  time: '36:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] It''s a good question. As you work with increasingly senior stakeholders,
    you definitely need to use your time wisely. I recommend just thinking of a couple
    of questions that you want to ask them and going in with those prepared. A general
    way that you could start is just kind of asking them about (this sounds maybe
    a little aggressive) but like, “What are you trying to do at this company? What
    are your priorities? What are your goals? What are you worried about? What are
    you excited about?” You should set the context upfront in talking to a senior
    leader. Like, “I was told I should meet more people. I''m trying to learn more.”'
  sec: 2210
  time: '36:50'
  who: Katie

    I get the same advice to talk to a product manager. In both of these cases, it's
    a similar situation like, “Okay. Now this person is in front of me. What should
    I ask them?” Then I think you said, “Do your homework,” right?
  sec: 2253

  sec: 2253
  time: '37:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] That''s fair. Maybe that''s not how you start. But as you said –
    do your homework. A really good way to start a conversation – look someone up
    on LinkedIn, ask them about particular things on their resume that they''re interested
    in, or even just ask them a general question. You started this conversation today
    by talking about my career trajectory. Ask them how they got into product management.
    Ask them how they became interested in working for the company that you work for.
    That''s a good way to break the ice.'

    I take notes, and then based on these notes, I come up with other questions in
    addition to what we prepared – in addition to the homework that we prepared for
    this interview. Okay. So where were we? We were talking about management helping
    juniors, right? [Katie agrees] [cross-talk]
  sec: 2313
  time: '38:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was gonna say, if I have to, summarize the thing that juniors need the most
    – it is practice and exposure. They need to do lots of different types of work
    to learn the fundamentals and you learn it best by going through the motions a
    couple of times and learning the typical lifecycle of a project, what techniques
    make sense in certain places. It's good to make mistakes and low-stakes ways as
    well, because you often remember mistakes better than you remember successes.
  sec: 2342
  time: '39:02'
  who: Katie
- line: And then exposure – it's good for them to work with a lot of different types
    of people, see different ways that things are done. They can develop their own
    preferences and opinions and as they become increasingly senior, it's their job
    to deploy those opinions, and to use them constructively at the company. So it's
    good to just see a lot of different ways of doing things so people don't specialize
    too early. You should definitely not specialize as a junior person. Because there's
    still a lot of basic things to learn and you might not know what you like yet.
  sec: 2342

  who: Katie
- header: The importance of hiring juniors
- line: I'm just wondering. Seniors are independent, so we need to help them by delegating
    some of the stuff that we need to do – seems like a good deal, right? You just
    have the stuff you need to work on and delegate it to seniors. And then we have
    juniors – we need to spend a lot more time with them. We need to think about “How
    do we help them grow? How do you pair them with seniors? How do we make sure they're
    not getting stuck? How do we make sure they don’t start specializing (like you
    just mentioned)?”
  sec: 2412
  time: '40:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: So why should we even bother hiring juniors? Why don't we just hire an all
    senior team and then delegate all the tasks to them and go drink coffee all day?
    That’s what managers do, right?
  sec: 2412
  time: '40:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [laughs] I mean, some people do think this way. Of course. Some people
    do think that way, where it's like, “We should just hire as many senior people
    as possible.” But it's good to hire junior people. We talk a lot about “build
    versus buy” in the industry broadly. And when it comes to building a team, hiring
    senior people is kind of like buying and hiring junior people is kind of like
    building. You can never hire exactly the person you want. With junior people,
    you're kind of growing them into the next generation of leaders that you need.
  sec: 2459
  time: '40:59'
  who: Katie
- line: Really, one of the best advantages of having junior people is you've got people
    who grow up in the environment that you're in, and they have really good context
    for it by the time they're senior. So they end up being amazing at your particular
    company. But another thing that's really important about having junior people
    is that it helps grow senior people. A senior person can be responsible for a
    lot of different things. They can lead an area, they can make a lot of technological
    choices, but ultimately, at the end of the day, a big part for them of growing
    and scaling themselves is being responsible for more junior people. You get into
    a weird situation if you have an only senior team where people are trying to manufacture
    mentorship opportunities for themselves. They'll awkwardly try to mentor each
    other, or claim that they're the mentor of the other person.
  sec: 2459
  time: '40:59'
  who: Katie
- line: It's just good to have junior people around who can learn from the seniors
    and who the seniors can learn by working with. It's just part of building an organization
    that is sustainable long term. You want to make sure there are people coming up
    and as your senior people do end up graduating – maybe they decide they want to
    go to a different company – you are ready with junior people to rise up and fill
    their spot.
  sec: 2459
  time: '40:59'
  who: Katie
- line: Also, with juniors, they don’t have as much experience as seniors and they
    quite often ask things like, “Okay, but why does it work this way? Why do you
    do it this way and not this way?” Seniors might know but they have to explain
    these things to juniors and while doing this, they also learn, right? I don't
    know if it's a valid comparison, but it’s sort of like with kids. [laughs]
  sec: 2578
  time: '42:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I do think that's right, though. You learn a lot by having to explain
    something to someone. Also, like what you're saying, a junior person comes in
    and they have a fresh set of eyes – maybe they see something doesn't make sense
    and it actually doesn't and you should change it. And you wouldn't have noticed
    it because everyone else is just used to it. It's helpful to have people who are
    thinking about things differently as well.

    careers are long. You may work with these people again in some other context.
    Maybe it won't be at the same company, but it's good to have worked with people
    before and know what they're like – know that you can trust them and also just
    go in with a good relationship from the start.

    attributes would you use for evaluation in an interview?”
  sec: 2679
  time: '44:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: To figure out what I would need for a data science manager, it would partly
    be determined by what stage of the company I'm at. If I, today, were trying to
    hire a data science manager, I would probably be looking for something different
    than I would be at an established company. So if you're a head of data at a small
    company, and you're looking for a data science manager, you're probably going
    to look for someone who has been a manager before and has a good idea of how to
    run projects, how to grow careers, has some sort of broader sense of the company's
    strategy, or seems capable of thinking about it.
  sec: 2697
  time: '44:57'
  who: Katie
- line: If I take a moment to try to think about dimensions that I think are important
    for people leadership, you do need to know about the craft pretty well and have
    a sense of common career paths for that craft. You need to be good at growing
    people and you need to be able to work cross-functionally with other leads at
    your level. For a data science manager, I would definitely want someone who can
    talk to engineering managers, to product managers, all the different stakeholders
    that you would have to work with. Certainly, in the interview process, I would
    ensure that you meet some of those people so you can get a sense of your chemistry
    with them.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Well, I'm not watching them through a two-way mirror or something. [laughs]
    When I'm designing interview panels, I think it's pretty important for there to
    be some sort of cross-functional aspect – you talk about values, you talk about
    strategy for the domain, something like that – just so that the two of you can
    get a sense of whether you would like each other. The candidate interviewing for
    the position should also really care about whether they will like the people they're
    going to work with and use the interview as an opportunity to think about that.
  sec: 2787

    they can help with defining the company's strategy and things like this. But to

    you maybe tell us how exactly you can evaluate this?
  sec: 2821
  time: '47:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's fair. It is kind of a vague word, much like data science. By
    “strategy,” I really mean that they're capable of reasoning about the decisions
    they would make in this role and the trade-offs of those decisions. It might be
    “Let's talk about a problem similar to what you would experience. There are two
    options you could choose. What would be the advantage of doing one versus the
    other? How would you measure that? How would you reason about the way those choices
    would bear out in metrics? How you might think about building a team to support
    that? What sort of systems would you need?” It's really trying to figure out like,
    “Can you plan? Can you understand the environment you're in and come up with a
    solution to address the problems that you see?”
  sec: 2841
  time: '47:21'
  who: Katie

    way to check if the candidates have these skills is to ask them about their past
    experience, right? Like, “Tell me about the time when you needed to help a junior
    grow.” Right?
  sec: 2891
  time: '48:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That's not terrible. Where possible, I prefer to put people in a scenario
    where they demonstrate the skill. Because it's easy to make up a story or tell
    an overly nice anecdote about a time that you did this thing. It's a lot better
    to get someone in a situation where they have to demonstrate their critical thinking
    skills. For something like coding – that they're comprehending code that they
    see or maybe writing some. It's way more important to see how they behave than
    it is to hear them tell stories about how they behave. It's not always easy to
    do that, of course.

    not sure how to address. Some of the situations that people managers need to talk
    about in interviews, for example, “Have you ever had to put someone on a performance
    improvement plan?” You can't simulate that really. [chuckles] You probably have
    to ask them the story about it. But where possible, it's good to have them show
    the skills.
  sec: 2910

    have previous experience, it's helpful to hear about it. But I don't know. In
    terms of putting someone in a situation for something like a strategy discussion,
    that might be a case study where you talk about “The company has this problem

    the juniors. Currently, the competition is quite severe. There are many juniors
    and not so many junior positions. Do you have any suggestions for them? How can
    they set themselves apart from the rest? How can they get hired? How can they
    get noticed?
  sec: 3021
  time: '50:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: One thing that I strongly recommend is being open to a lot of possibilities.
    If you are a junior, there are some companies that would be better to work for,
    probably, in that they have a large team where you could learn from a lot of different
    people. If you have the option, you should try to go for it. But that isn't always
    true. A lot of times, you can't get your dream job as your first job. So be open
    to a lot of different possibilities, and go to a position where you can get in
    the door, get paid well, and learn a lot. Then you can start looking for something
    that you're perhaps more interested in, broadly. But in terms of standing out
    – if the company does not explicitly say they want someone senior and you can
    find the hiring manager, it's helpful to talk to them.

  time: '51:03'
  who: Katie
- line: Don't worry about impressing them with some kind of portfolio, necessarily.
    Some people really like that. Some people will not read it. [chuckles] Hiring
    managers often have a lot of people contacting them. If you're asking them for
    a lot in that communication, they may not have time to respond. Even if they want
    to, they may not have the ability to give you detailed feedback. Basically, be
    friendly, be professional, do your homework in terms of understanding what the
    opportunity is and just be bold in reaching out.
  sec: 3063
  time: '51:03'
  who: Katie
- line: Let's say I got hired to a company and I started as a junior. How do I go
    about my first month? Who should I talk to make sure that when I grow my career,
    I get as much as possible from this company? Hopefully there is a manager who
    is doing what we just described. But how can I, as a junior, help this manager
    help me?
  sec: 3163
  time: '52:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: A very good thing to do is to just be very open and honest about how things
    are going. There's a common mode – and this is even worse in remote environments
    – where if you are a junior person and you get stuck on something, you don't want
    to talk about it because you feel like you should be able to prove yourself or
    you should know better or you should be able to solve it yourself. Don't do that.
    Just tell people if you're stuck. It's their job to help you. It's better for
    you to tell them proactively, because they might otherwise wonder like, “Well,
    what are they doing?”
  sec: 3189
  time: '53:09'
  who: Katie
- line: They're there to help you and it's a lot faster to solve it just by asking
    someone. Maybe it's not your manager, maybe it's a senior person on the team who
    you feel comfortable asking or just another junior or a teammate. At any point
    in your career, really, but especially when you're junior – just talk to people
    a lot, especially when you feel stuck. It's a lot easier to grow if you are getting
    help from a lot of people.
  sec: 3189
  time: '53:09'
  who: Katie
- header: Asking senior colleagues for help and the rubber duck channel
- line: One of the concerns I heard from juniors is that they are afraid of interrupting
    other people (seniors). The seniors are busy, “This is a very senior person, they
    have a lot of stuff to work on.” They don't feel that they should be interrupting
    them every two hours with more and more questions. What do you think they should
    do? I think it's totally okay to interrupt, right? Do you have some suggestions?
  sec: 3251
  time: '54:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. If you're worried about that, one thing you could do is ask them for
    some kind of regular check-in and then that's your questions. As you come up with
    stuff throughout the day, write it down in a doc somewhere – a note – and then
    when you have another check-in with that person, ask a bunch of stuff then. It's
    also potentially worthwhile to ask the person, “When are good times for me to
    interrupt you (or to reach out)?” A lot of companies also have some sort of… it
    has all sorts of different names – sometimes it's “the rubber duck channel,” where
    you go… [cross-talk]
  sec: 3287
  time: '54:47'
  who: Katie
- line: Rubber duck channel? That’s like support, right?
  sec: 3325
  time: '55:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. In software engineering, you're supposed to talk to the rubber duck
    on your desk, because just talking through a problem helps you solve it. Usually,
    there's some kind of channel – Slack channel or whatever, Microsoft Teams, maybe?
    [laughs]

  time: '55:29'
  who: Katie
- line: '#venting'
  sec: 3343
  time: '55:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. There's usually some kind of support mechanism at a lot of companies
    to go and describe a problem. Even just describing it can sometimes help you figure
    it out. But then other people may see it, and respond. That's also a good place
    to potentially seek out help.
  sec: 3344
  time: '55:44'
  who: Katie
- line: Yeah, it sometimes feels awkward. I sometimes find myself in the situation
    when I go to the support channel, I just type the problem and then I hit enter
    and then one minute after that, I realize how to solve this problem. Then people
    already start answering, but I already know how to solve it. [laughs]
  sec: 3360
  time: '56:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Yeah, definitely.'
  sec: 3377
  time: '56:17'
  who: Katie
- header: The challenges of the head of data
- line: I feel that we’re jumping a little bit – from head to junior and then back
    – but this is a very interesting question. I want to ask you that as well. I know
    that we don't have a lot of time, but maybe we can try to cover this too. “What
    are the challenges that you're currently facing as head of data? And what challenges
    didn't you anticipate earlier?”
  sec: 3380
  time: '56:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: One of the big challenges you always experience in senior leadership roles
    is that no one is going to tell you how to do your job. [chuckles] You kind of
    have to figure it out on your own. You may see a lot of different problems and
    you're not sure where to start. That's certainly something. I wouldn't necessarily
    say that I see a lot of problems, but I see a lot of things that we'll need to
    address at some point and figuring out what order I do it is a big question for
    me and what I'm spending a lot of time thinking about. I wouldn't say that I've
    seen anything so far that I've been extremely surprised by. There are certainly
    genres of problems that I know will appear on any data team.
  sec: 3406
  time: '56:46'
  who: Katie
- line: One thing, perhaps, that is top of mind for me as a senior leader in data,
    is “How do I change this company into a place where my team can be successful?”
    I need to make my team successful but I also need to build a culture of data literacy
    and excitement about data. There are a lot of different dimensions to that, like
    “How do I build high trust in our data? How do I make sure people know how to
    interpret it? How do I make sure people know where to find data? How do I make
    sure people are regularly engaged with it?” These are problems that I need to
    solve that are organizational and I can't just send an email and be like, “You
    all need to go look at this dashboard every day.” [laughs] Even if I did that,
    no one would listen (maybe someone would listen to me, I don't know). So it's
    a lot of building excitement and building culture and that is not easy to do.
    But it's also one of the things that I like most about this type of role. So I'm
    very excited about it.
  sec: 3406
  time: '56:46'
  who: Katie
- line: I guess for any of those things that you mentioned – data literacy, data excitement,
    trusting data – each of these topics deserves a separate interview/separate episode,
    right? They're quite broad.
  sec: 3516
  time: '58:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Maybe I''ll come back sometime.'
  sec: 3532
  time: '58:52'
  who: Katie
- header: Conclusion
- line: Yeah. Unfortunately, we need to wrap it up. We need to finish. Is there anything
    else that you wanted to say, but you didn't have a chance to? Maybe you want to
    say something before we finish today?
  sec: 3535
  time: '58:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I guess the final bit of advice I have for managers thinking about career
    growth is – careers are really about direction. One of the most important things
    you can do for people on your team is help them feel like they have a sense of
    direction and that they're building towards something. If you can achieve that,
    you're a master of career growth.
  sec: 3549
  time: '59:09'
  who: Katie
- line: Interesting. I’m wondering how to do that. Maybe you have something? You probably
    have a thread on Twitter about this, right?
  sec: 3573
  time: '59:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] If I don''t, I should write one.'
  sec: 3581
  time: '59:41'
  who: Katie
- line: Yeah, you should, definitely. Okay, thanks. You started using Twitter when
    you worked with Twitter or earlier?
  sec: 3583
  time: '59:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: I've been a longtime user and I have become more active over the past couple
    of years with quarantines and whatnot but… [chuckles] I’m fairly active on Twitter,
    so that is a good place to talk to me if you want to continue the conversation
    somehow.
  sec: 3590
  time: '59:50'
  who: Katie
- line: I was just going to ask how to find you online, but I think you mentioned
    that even earlier. Twitter, LinkedIn, right?
  sec: 3606
  time: '1:00:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yep.
  sec: 3612
  time: '1:00:12'
  who: Katie
- line: Okay. That was a great chat. Thanks for joining us today. Thanks for answering
    all these questions. I also want to thank everyone who joined us today, and who
    asked questions. I saw that there’s a lot of discussion in the live chat. Unfortunately,
    I could really keep up with this because I was interviewing, but I will check
    it out. So hope we didn’t miss many questions. But yeah – thanks, everyone. It
    was great talking to you. Have a great weekend!
