- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: 'Guest Overview: Ksenia and episode focus (project management → data science)'
- line: This week we will talk about transitioning from project management to data
    science. We have a special guest today — Ksenia. Ksenia is currently working as
    a data science manager at momox. After four years working as a project manager,
    she turned her career towards data science. She spent three years researching
    fraud and anomaly detection techniques and she earned a degree in data analytics.
    Welcome, Ksenia.

- header: 'Career Foundations: math degree, management, and early PM roles'
- line: Before we start, before we go to our main topic, can you tell us about your
    career journey?
  sec: 180
  time: '3:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: In 2013, I got fundamental education in math, in Russia, in a quite prominent
    university. Then I got another management degree in 2014. Then I spent four years
    as Alexey mentioned in project management. I worked and managed projects in e-services,
    governmental services, traveling, telecom, and other fields. Then I acquired another
    master's degree in Information System Management. In parallel, I was doing research
    for three years and I will explain about it later on in further details. I'm working
    as a data scientist since 2019. Already for three years. Currently I'm working
    in momox and I shifted my focus from fraud detection to marketing. Now I'm applying
    data science techniques in marketing. It's quite entertaining and I really like
    this field so far. There are a lot of optimization challenges, a lot of things
    to predict and improve. It's really a nice place and position to work.
  sec: 189
  time: '3:09'
  who: Ksenia
- header: 'Motivation for Analytics: customer-centric, data-driven decision making'
- line: Data science attracts many people from quite different backgrounds. For example,
    I am a software engineer. Many people who are working in data analytics also go
    into data science. And sometimes project managers like yourself get interested
    in this. I’m curious, how did it happen for you? When you realize that machine
    learning is such an interesting field?
  sec: 275
  time: '4:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: This question that I have heard so many times. I will rephrase it. Before
    going into machine learning, I realized that data analysis is super interesting
    for me. When I worked in project management, I worked closely to development.
    My work was associated with decision making. I was curious, every time when I
    make some decision, is it right or not? Why should I decide it? How can I decide
    it? I don't know. At those times concepts like “know your customers” or principled
    in marketing, and customer centric way of thinking have been developed and integrated
    in businesses. People started to learn what customers want. And they shared a
    lot of data that companies have towards their products. You can analyze it and
    it would be not smart to not use this data. In those times, I realized that I
    want to make a decision, which would improve the product, but based on the customer's
    preferences. Because it's not me who decides what direction the products should
    go. But it's the customers who actually drive this business and who consumes this
    product. I think it's super important to analyze data and to understand the sense
    out of this — what your customer wants. That's how I got into data analysis and
    that's why I became interested in this field.
  sec: 316
  time: '5:16'
  who: Ksenia
- header: 'Transition Path: moving from data analysis into machine learning'
- line: You worked as a project manager, and you needed to make all the decisions.
    Usually, to make these decisions, you would rely on data. You realized that analyzing
    data is such an interesting thing. Then you got into data analytics more for supporting
    this decision-making process. Then, after that, you transitioned from data analytics
    to more machine learning and data science.
  sec: 414
  time: '6:54'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Analytics vs. Data Science: descriptive analysis vs. forecasting'
- line: I would say this is the next step. When you analyze data and you feel comfortable.
    This is when you learn some packages to analyze data, to visualize data, to deliver
    your findings and also interpreted on the business level. Then you start becoming
    interested in “What’s next?” I derive this knowledge, but what will my customer
    do next? I personally think that data analysis is more focused on historical data
    and deriving a sense of what your customer did or how your business went so far.
    Data science is forecasting the future so you try to predict what's going on.
    I think that you probably can't go to data science without transitions into data
    analytics. Data analysis is the main part of any data science project. Because
    you have to analyze your data — just to build your hypothesis on top of what you
    observed.
  sec: 450
  time: '7:30'
  who: Ksenia
- header: 'Learning Strategy: assess strengths and target skill gaps'
- line: We've had a question, “what is the difference between data analytics and data
    science?” And I think you just covered that. If somebody decides to study data
    science, how do they do it? How did it happen for you? You realized that there’s
    a lot of potential in data. That I need to analyze this data, I need to understand
    what's going on? How did you decide which things to study to be able to do this?
  sec: 513
  time: '8:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Firstly, I tried to search through the internet by myself and just find some
    courses on Udemy, and Coursera, and so on. But soon, if you do the same, you'll
    figure out that the amount of knowledge is immense. You’re lost where to start.
    I felt the same when I started to approach this topic. My benefit was that I already
    got familiar with math, statistics, probability theory, and everything fundamental
    that you need for data science. I think that you have to come out of your background.
    If you try to shift your career from backend development, you're already experienced
    in coding, engineering stuff and so on. So you probably want to learn some packages
    for data analysis and also improve your statistical knowledge. If you come from
    data analysis, it’s another pool of information that you have to пуе before. So
    you have to understand your strengths. Then realize what is lacking for you in
    your skill set, and then add it up to your profile. For me, it was like, I’m really
    fond of fundamental things and I already got two degrees and I decided “Okay why
    not get a third one?” That's why I choose my path.
  sec: 551
  time: '9:11'
  who: Ksenia
- line: If I understood correctly, you mentioned that you already had a mathematical
    background. You already knew statistics. Is it something you needed to use as
    a project manager? Or this is something that you learn during your studies?
  sec: 652
  time: '10:52'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Education Choices: benefits of formal degrees vs. self-study'
- line: Yeah, I was just lucky that I got math as my first degree. I have to say that
    at 17 years old, I definitely knew what I wanted to do for my life and knew what
    to learn and so on. My math was chosen and I learned it. I probably did not use
    it so extensively in my project management career. But I'm really grateful that
    I had it in my background, because it helped me a lot when I got into this data
    analytics degree. It was super useful. I knew all this stuff and the main thing
    was just to remember it from the bottom of my head.
  sec: 670
  time: '11:10'
  who: Ksenia
- line: So you studied mathematics during your bachelor's degree. You worked as a
    project manager. Then you got into data analytics, you started to learn all these
    things. And then you realized and this stuff that they learned at university was
    actually really useful.
  sec: 715
  time: '11:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but it wasn't like this. It was like “Okay, I know math and it's my
    strengths. How can I improve my profile based on this?” I don't want to waste
    what I already have. Data analysis and machine learning was based on what I already
    have. I want to extend my knowledge. So it wasn't a spontaneous decision. Of course,
    I realized that I will need math for this and “oh, okay, I know it already”.
  sec: 734
  time: '12:14'
  who: Ksenia
- line: I guess math was not the only thing you needed. In addition to mathematics,
    what are the other things you needed?
  sec: 769
  time: '12:49'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Core Skill Set: programming, statistics, and domain expertise'
- line: You definitely need engineering skills and ability to code. It's super important
    and we will cover this later on. Another thing, you need to analyze data. Mathematics
    is just a theory. But when it comes to practice, you have to get a feeling of
    why you need it, and how you can apply it. Another thing that I find quite important
    is domain expertise. When you work as a data scientist, you're not working in
    space, in the middle of nowhere. You're working on specific fields. You have to
    study it, and it will be nice if you know business KPIs, if you know what you
    want to achieve in business terms and so on. This is what definitely has to be
    learned.
  sec: 780
  time: '13:00'
  who: Ksenia
- line: You also mentioned you tried to pick up these skills online by trying to do
    courses on Udemy, Udacity. But it was just too much information, too many courses,
    it was too difficult to choose what to learn, and you decided to get masters for
    this reason.
  sec: 840
  time: '14:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that these people, they're professionals in education. They definitely
    should know how to teach people. The main reasons that I can summarize why it's
    worth to go to master’s degree. First of all, it's deep enough. From university,
    you can have the deepest knowledge you can find. In books by yourself, but it
    would be difficult. More difficult than just going through a lecture — get this
    feeling and understand the concept and so on, from people that you can ask. Deep
    enough, well structured. People who construct this study plan for you, they thought
    before what should be covered in what order.
  sec: 867
  time: '14:27'
  who: Ksenia
- line: When you start to trace some websites and internet, you can be lost in understanding
    what you should study before and next. Your learning plan should be sequential.
    And universities should know how to do this. Then you have to experience an increasing
    level of complexity. If you just straightaway dive into neural networks and deep
    learning, you probably can feel overwhelmed or even demotivated to proceed. It's
    quite difficult to start with. That's another benefit of going to university because
    it's structured for you at this increasing pace. Then feedback that I already
    mentioned. You have to do some exercises, you can ask for feedback, and so on.
    Another thing that I find really cool here in Germany. During my study, I got
    a position in a research laboratory and I spent three years during my study as
    a researcher. I was lucky that I studied something in a lecture, and I immediately
    applied it in practice. It was so beneficial, because if you learn something new,
    and you don't apply it straightaway, it will fade out of your head. It's a pity
    that you have to learn it again and again in the future. This is why I chose a
    degree.
  who: Ksenia
- line: What things did you study? I understood the benefits. It's very hard to argue
    with these benefits. I'm wondering what concrete things you studied at university.
    What were the most useful things — what subjects or courses?
  sec: 1019
  time: '16:59'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Recommended Coursework: machine learning, time series, graph analysis'
- line: Because I knew that I wanted to go towards a data science career. At university,
    there was a lot of freedom to choose. I have chosen the hardest courses. I was
    really interested in it. I choose machine learning classes — supervised and not
    unsupervised. Then artificial intelligent classes. They're quite different. They
    speak about the same problems, but from different angles. Then multivariate analysis,
    statistics, time series analysis, graph theory, networks analysis, and all this
    mathematical stuff. I felt that I knew math and probably I can tackle these courses.
  sec: 1038
  time: '17:18'
  who: Ksenia
- line: It was quite focused on data science, because you could select the courses
    you wanted. You knew what you wanted to study and you picked up courses that you
    thought would be super useful for your career, like machine learning, artificial
    intelligence, statistics.
  sec: 1086
  time: '18:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: From my previous experience as a project manager I observed the problems.
    I know what business needs — or at least I have an impression that I know it.
    I tried to base my choice of courses on what I observed in the business. It is
    also another benefit to go to a master program after having some experience. Because
    you understand what you will be resolving later on at work and why you have to
    choose this or that.
  sec: 1105
  time: '18:25'
  who: Ksenia
- line: I can already see how your background as a project manager was useful. It
    feels like it was very carefully planned — the way you approached your studies.
    You knew what you wanted to do, and you just went for it. That's really cool.
    I know we already talked about online courses. You had a chance to compare these
    online courses and the courses you took at university. What is your opinion, how
    they're different and what worked better for you?
  sec: 1135
  time: '18:55'
  who: Alexey
- header: Online Resources & Course Picks (including mlcourse.ai)
- line: I can even give advice to people who are interested in choosing between having
    a nanodegree degree online and go into university. It depends on your purpose.
    If you want to pick up some knowledge about a specific package to analyze or visualize
    data, it's enough to go to code academy and pick the first course that explains
    the semantics, gives some examples. And you learn it immediately in one or two
    evenings. But if you really want to understand the deep nature of data science
    concepts, I can recommend some nice online courses that helped me. I didn't do
    it during my university. During the study I took a lot of classes and also I worked
    as a researcher and I had enough practice and knowledge to consume. It was a full
    learning process.
  sec: 1176
  time: '19:36'
  who: Ksenia
- line: But when I graduated, I realized that sometimes when you do one thing, you
    might forget something else. You have to refresh your knowledge. I do some classes
    on machine learning every year just to refresh my knowledge about everything.
    Because usually at work you don't use everything that you learned. But it's still
    important to have it in mind. I personally find this fundamental online class
    and what I could recommend. There is OpenDataScience community and they provide
    once a year this online course designed by Yury Kashnitsky. It’s a well-structured
    course that gives you a deep understanding of algorithms and also provides a lot
    of practice. You can communicate with tutors and also get feedback. You also communicate
    with peers and learn from them. I personally really like it and guys did nice
    courses completely for free.
  who: Ksenia
- line: I'm googling it right now. It's called “mlcourse.ai”. I also took that course
    and it’s amazing. I also took this course when I was already working as a data
    scientist. When it comes to this understanding of different algorithms I think
    this is a really great course.
  sec: 1320
  time: '22:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: I repeated your experience unconsciously.
  sec: 1346
  time: '22:26'
  who: Ksenia
- header: 'Transferable PM Skills: planning, stakeholder communication, business KPIs'
- line: I already mentioned that your background as a project manager helped you at
    least in structuring the way you approached your education, like deciding which
    courses to take. I think it was really well thought through. Were there any other
    things from your experience as a project manager that helped you?
  sec: 1352
  time: '22:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: I will not go in for myself because I'm not that representative here. But
    I summarized some background that you can transfer from project manager to data
    science. It's not that obvious and I really like to put some time on this question.
    Some people think that it's quite obvious to transfer from data engineering or
    from data analytics to data science. Because you can code, you can analyze data,
    process it. You already know some query languages and so on. But people underestimate
    what benefits you can bring to data science coming from project management.
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Ksenia
- line: This benefit is definitely in soft skills. You are experienced in planning
    projects. Any data science project is just a project. You have to plan it in advance
    and you already know how to do this. You have to focus on the big picture, not
    to restrict yourself to some details, but you have to plan your roadmap. Set some
    milestones and so on. It's a normal project that you have to set up and you have
    to decompose it. You have to schedule it. You have to plan it — and you already
    know how to do it. Usually it’s done by some lead or manager. In data science,
    being a data science manager, it's the best thing that you can do. Because you
    know both things from your perspective. You also can define success measures.
    It’s quite important and really difficult. People tend to define it from their
    point of view. If you're into business, if you stay close to the business decisions,
    you can identify success in terms of business, revenue, margin, or what you can
    imagine. This is what board and managers really like. If you work as a data scientist,
    you can speak with them in the same language, and they can understand you. You
    are transparent and it's super important — this is what I learn from my practice.
  who: Ksenia
- line: “Speak the same language” — this is what I mentioned. It has already been
    covered in one of DataTalks podcasts — by Vin Vasishtha. He spoke a lot about
    the borders of business language. It was quite a nice talk. What I also find useful
    and borrowed from project management experience is — be business oriented. When
    you make some data analysis, you extract and derive some sense, some knowledge.
    You probably find some outliers, and you plot some distributions. Okay. It's nice,
    but what does it mean? Not for you, as data scientists or statisticians — what
    does it mean for business? Where do you lose money? Where do you earn it? Why
    you lose some customers? Why are churn rates so high? It's really important to
    put it in the business language, and to understand the reason what your distribution
    shows you in business terms.
  who: Ksenia
- line: Understanding the business really helps you in problem definitions. You can
    frame your problem before solving it — [to make it] really clear for everyone.
    It's also entangled with the business understanding. I think that Elena Samuylova
    mentioned it in her talk “How your machine learning project will fail”. She spoke
    a lot about problem definition and how it is important. You definitely should
    understand how business works. You, as a project manager, already have experience
    to communicate with stakeholders, to be clear, to deliver the right information
    at the right time, in the right order. This is important also in data science,
    because you build your model not for building it, but to deliver value to the
    business and to communicate it right.
  who: Ksenia
- line: The last thing, but not least, is be proactive. When you are a project manager,
    you have to be proactive. You have to initiate many processes. You have to organize
    people, organize things, and plan and so on. This pro-activity is super nice,
    also in data science, because it fills a gap between technical implementation
    engineering and mathematical concepts to the business. This is where people could
    improve themselves to get on business level. This pro-activity and curiosity about
    business purposes, about a business KPIs, will definitely help to bring your model
    on the next level and estimated in business KPIs. This is what my project management
    experience brings me to data science.
  who: Ksenia
- line: Thanks for mentioning and some of the presentations we had on DataTalks.Club.
    For those who are listening, or watching, they are on our YouTube channel. You
    can go to our channel after this talk and you will find them. One was a talk by
    Vin Vasishtha about monetizing machine learning. And the other one is from Elena
    — “how your machine learning project will fail”. Elena's talk is one of our most
    watched talks [in our channel]. Check it out.
  sec: 1740
  time: '29:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: I wanted to ask you. You mentioned that one of the things that helped you
    most were planning skills. You were able to plan a project because a data science
    project is a project. Because you have experienced planning projects, you can
    take this experience and apply it to data science projects. For those who do not
    have this background in project management, maybe there is a simple course or
    a book that they can take to get this planning skill? Maybe you have some recommendations
    for that.
  sec: 1778
  time: '29:38'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Project Frameworks: using CRISP‑DM to structure data projects'
- line: Definitely. It's fortunate that it's already developed. I would recommend
    to use the standard of the industry in data mining — CRISP-DM framework. It's
    really convenient for data science projects. I also use it. It's nicely structured.
    You can structure your project based on the stages of the CRISP-DM framework.
    It's really well designed. it's one way to go. And regardless, if you come from
    project management or from whatever, it's nice to use in data science.
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Ksenia
- line: Yeah, even though it's a bit old methodology, it's 20 years old, it's surprising
    that it still applies to projects these days. Do you say that planning skill was
    the most useful one?
  sec: 1871
  time: '31:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that the most useful skill to have, in my situation at least, is being
    business oriented. Because your business, your stakeholders, expect from you to
    deliver value. Of course, you have to plan. If you can be transparent, if you
    speak the same language, if you're oriented to business KPIs, this brings us more
    success to really deliver value. Not statistical inferences from the data, but
    transferring them to the business terms. This would be the most important thing
    for data scientists. It helps.
  sec: 1892
  time: '31:32'
  who: Ksenia
- line: We have a question from Sandela. Do you think an experienced project manager
    would already be a good fit for a junior data analyst role? Or they still would
    need to learn some things, to pick up some extra skills to be able to work as
    a data analyst?
  sec: 1936
  time: '32:16'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Starting as a Data Analyst: apply analysis at work and build portfolio'
- line: I think I mentioned it, but I will elaborate more on my response. Becoming
    a data analyst after a project manager career is exactly the way to go. You see
    a lot of data. You have to analyze it. If you have to derive some knowledge out
    of this — and what I would recommend you to start with — if you're already working
    as a product manager, and you are eager to tend to your career towards that data
    science, just start to analyze data that you already have. Because you have your
    data. You have your project. And I am sure that you know how you can improve your
    decision based on your data.
  sec: 1963
  time: '32:43'
  who: Ksenia
- line: You can start straight away. It will be amazing, because you will be motivated
    in doing this. Going after your full day of work to home and picking some knowledge
    from some courses — it's probably not that motivating. Because you're already
    tired, and you want to relax. It's overwhelming. But if you really try to apply
    your knowledge and your skills in data analysis on your work, it's a way to go
    — it's beneficial for your project management tasks, because you will decide better.
    You will make a better decision based on the data and based on the knowledge that
    you've derived. Try to apply your knowledge already while being a project manager
    and try to get into data analysis as soon as possible.
  who: Ksenia
- line: I assume that the usual technology stack, the tools the data analysts use,
    is quite different from what the project manager would use. I imagine that for
    project managers, the tools will be Microsoft Excel or something similar, like
    spreadsheet software. So, how would you go from working with excel spreadsheets
    to SQL or even Python and Pandas?
  sec: 2058
  time: '34:18'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Tools Progression: spreadsheets → BI tools (Tableau/Trifacta) → Python
    & Pandas'
- line: I would recommend to start with frameworks that are already developed for
    data analysis — drag and drop tools. For example, Tableau and Trifacta for data
    cleaning and data analysis. You don't need to learn any coding language to start
    with these tools, but you already can analyze your data. You already can understand
    some summary statistics from this tool. Just put the data there and try to play
    around with this to plot some distributions and to analyze it. You don't actually
    need code at the very beginning.
  sec: 2088
  time: '34:48'
  who: Ksenia
- line: As a next step I would definitely recommend to get some courses on Python
    — probably just a simple one from Udacity or somewhere. And get some basic knowledge
    about packages to analyze and visualize data. It's not that difficult because
    Python has a really low threshold to get in and it's easy to learn. That's why
    it's so common in the community, because it's really not that hard. I definitely
    recommend to you, as a next step, to pick some Python knowledge and already apply
    matplotlib charts or something like this. And Pandas.
  who: Ksenia
- line: What would be the best way to start with coding? One thing you mentioned —
    take some courses online. Maybe it doesn't really matter which one, just take
    one course and try to go through it. What I want to ask — okay somebody did this
    course — so what's next? How can they apply this to actually solving the problem?

- header: 'Community Learning: OpenDataScience, DataTalks, and mentorship'
- line: I started to analyze data through Python. In university I had some classes
    but it was mostly recommendations and buzzwords, like “Jupyter notebook”, and
    you figure out by yourself what's going on. It's not like somebody would teach
    me. Now I would recommend people to really understand where to go. Join communities.
    It's super important. That's what I learned, and I regret that I didn't do it
    early. DataTalks community or OpenDataScience community. Communities are really
    powerful. Don't be shy — in this community, there are a lot of people on different
    levels. You can ask whatever you have in mind, and people are quite open and willing
    to help. Start to learn from these people. Start to be curious about things. That's
    what I would recommend. You will definitely figure out how people analyze data.

- line: 'Other advice that I remember — open an account on Kaggle. That''s what also
    helped me a lot. Observe and study from others. In Kaggle you will find a lot
    of open notebooks and. You can understand how people analyze data — try to repeat
    it. Fake it until you make it right: repeat the best techniques, the best practices
    — what you observed. Try to pick people who achieved a lot on Kaggle — they probably
    will code some professional functions and so on. Just try to observe what other
    people do, if you start to learn. It''s important.'
  who: Ksenia
- line: You don't need to compete on Kaggle to actually learn from the site. You can
    just go to take a look at these notebooks and try to reproduce what others are
    doing there. That's already a very good start.
  sec: 2334
  time: '38:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, from the very beginning you probably can not compete, if you don't want.
    But I did and it was quite fun. As I mentioned, in the OpenDataScience community’s
    course, one or two homeworks was to compete in a Kaggle competition. This was
    fun because it was a group of people who try to solve the same problem. We share
    our notebooks and we learn from each other. If you resolve this problem and your
    peer resolves this problem, you might find his solution interesting. Learn from
    others, and somebody will learn from your solution. I think it's nice and it's
    fun. It's really important to stay motivated during the learning process.
  sec: 2349
  time: '39:09'
  who: Ksenia
- line: Kaggle is fun and you of course can acquire a lot of useful skills there.
    You can also do this from courses. Then you can do a couple of courses about Python,
    a couple of courses about analytics. But at work — if you work as a data scientist
    — it's not enough. You also need to have some other skills — for example, once
    you train the model, you need to be able to put it in Flask or Docker and deploy
    it somewhere. For people who did not code as project managers, who you're doing
    things with Excel — this is a pretty big leap — to go from that state to talking
    about Docker and Kubernetes and all these things. After doing Kaggle, what would
    be the next step to pick up these skills as well?
  sec: 2401
  time: '40:01'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Production Readiness: Git, testing, Docker, deployment, and Clean Code'
- line: It also was a question to me — how to jump from analytics to machine learning
    and machine learning in production. It's a different story. How I overcame this
    - I learned it at work. This is where you see this enterprise environment, where
    you see how people work. You also collaborate, and collaborative development is
    quite different from what you write in a notebook. You have to understand how
    Git works. You have to use it. You have to merge some branches and so on. It's
    a different process. You also should understand how to deploy your code and test
    it, what tests exist and so on. All this practice of development should be also
    picked up. For this I would recommend some advanced books, like “Clean Code”.
    It's important to read if you want to improve your coding skills. This is already
    advanced skills, I would say. You can improve and learn at work — just to observe
    how people do this, and, in the parallel, you can also read books about this.
    You're right it is quite a big leap.
  sec: 2467
  time: '41:07'
  who: Ksenia
- line: What you're saying is — it's enough to get hired as a data scientist. It's
    enough to know the theory, do a little bit of Kaggle, know some basics of programming,
    know how to visualize data to do some data analysis. All these things — this is
    sufficient to get hired as a data scientist. But then on the job you learn all
    these production skills. You learn about Docker. You learn about other things.
  sec: 2564
  time: '42:44'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Domain Specialization: research experience in fraud detection and node2vec'
- line: Two more things. What I planned for myself to acquire a job easily after graduating
    from university — I got into research and I spent three years in a specific domain.
    It was super beneficial — when you become professional in some specific domain,
    you know things. You can bring this knowledge to some company. What I learned
    and my thesis was about fraud detection. I studied this topic for three years
    and I coded a lot on this topic. I produced some projects on it. It was super
    beneficial for me to get hired — my next work after university, after the research
    position, I got hired as a fraud detection data scientist. The theory that I could
    bring to the company was super beneficial. So I would recommend, if you really
    want to study — at university, get involved in some research project or get a
    position in some laboratory. It really helps you to practice.
  sec: 2596
  time: '43:16'
  who: Ksenia
- line: Second, try to be T-shape. It’s an old concept but it's still valid. I would
    say, you have to know about anything like math, statistics, engineering, analytics
    and so on. But choose your strengths. Choose your domain. Choose your topic where
    you can say that “I know things. I know how to do this”. This will definitely
    help, because you can then put it in your career and use this benefit.
  who: Ksenia
- line: That's indeed something that many people overlook — for me personally, it
    was also the case — having experience in a specific domain. For you, how did it
    happen that you choose this particular domain of fraud detection? Was it just
    by coincidence, or you were actively looking to get involved in this?
  sec: 2707
  time: '45:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it was an accident. But any topic or domains that you choose, you
    should be passionate about. Otherwise, you lose motivation pretty soon. In my
    case, it was when I got a position in university. During the first semester in
    university, I was active, I wanted to study. One professor noticed me and invited
    me to work at Deutsche Telekom in his laboratory. He saw that I could deliver
    and I could help him to get some result on his research. For me, it was surprising
    because I didn't search for any work at that time. So for me, it was pure coincidence
    and I just answered “Okay, of course, let's go”. Because I really wanted to get
    this practical knowledge. And if you can also provide me feedback on my work,
    it would be so cool collaboration. That's how I get involved in the research.
    Honestly, I didn't plan it. But now I can definitely tell that it’s worth to do
    this. If you can — get involved into projects.
  sec: 2731
  time: '45:31'
  who: Ksenia
- line: So what you did was — you were active during classes and then a professor
    noticed you, invited you to the lab. Then, after graduating, you already had some
    domain experience in fraud detection, and the position you were looking for was
    also in this area. Was it very helpful for you to have this experience already
    in this domain? With your conversation in interviews.
  sec: 2810
  time: '46:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, this was purely about fraud detection. “What techniques have I been
    using so far, what helped a lot?” My thesis was on a really advanced topic. In
    my thesis, I modified the node2vec technique that has been developed in 2016 for
    analyzing networks. I applied this technique to identify or analyze money laundering
    and fraud and anomalies in loan networks. I was working on identifying fraud in
    monetary transactions. It’s a super-hot and useful topic. Then I applied to the
    companies that also work in this money laundering, with this fraud and so on.
    It was a match.
  sec: 2843
  time: '47:23'
  who: Ksenia
- line: It was a very focused approach. You had this domain expertise, and then you
    focused specifically on companies that are doing this sort of thing. I guess it
    worked out. Do you remember how many applications you sent? How many interviews
    did you get?
  sec: 2894
  time: '48:14'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Job Search Reality: applications, interviews, and persistence'
- line: It was a lot. After university, I sent around 50 applications and I got three
    offers. It is tough. When you try to get the first data science position, don't
    be desperate. It's hard every time for everyone. Don't be disappointed.
  sec: 2915
  time: '48:35'
  who: Ksenia
- line: It means that there were 50 companies. I don't know what your search area
    is. Was just Berlin or Germany or Europe? But 50 is quite a few.
  sec: 2944
  time: '49:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was quite ambitious. I also applied to big-4 companies and Google — because
    my thesis was based on the techniques they extensively use, like node2vec. I applied
    in Zurich. I didn't hope for anything but yeah.
  sec: 2961
  time: '49:21'
  who: Ksenia

  sec: 2992

  who: Ksenia

  sec: 2993
  time: '49:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say no. Not at all. Every time that I got interviewed, people asked
    me professional questions on my topic. I don't feel any discrimination at my processes
    at least.
  sec: 3011

  sec: 3034
  time: '50:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I didn't get into the interview process in Zurich. But yes. Any interview
    processes that I got so far, I got in Germany. It was quite professional and it's
    decent processes.
  sec: 3039
  time: '50:39'
  who: Ksenia
- line: Do you think you saw any difference between the applications that you covered
    in courses and classes and applications for your applications in the industry?
    That's a question from Romala.
  sec: 3058
  time: '50:58'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Bridging Theory and Practice: applying university work in industry'
- line: Yeah, it totally corresponds. What I want to emphasize here, I already applied
    these techniques to practice during my research and this was extremely beneficial.
    When you just learn techniques and machine learning approaches, and you don't
    apply it, you don't really understand how it works under the hood. But if you
    apply it immediately, you'll understand it, you remember it, and you can repeat
    it. Then, when I went to work, after university, I already knew more or less what
    I'm going to do, because I already did it. Yes, it's definitely important. It's
    definitely useful. What I have learned at university is applicable.
  sec: 3075
  time: '51:15'
  who: Ksenia
- line: There was no big gap between theory and practice?
  sec: 3124
  time: '52:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say no, but it also depends on the courses that you choose. I tried
    to choose practical deep courses, which I know will be definitely useful. Another
    tip, if you search for work as a data scientist, at the very beginning of your
    career changing, open and analyze data science job descriptions that you can find
    on the internet. This way, you will get familiar with techniques with what your
    employer expects from. This is super important to know in advance what to learn,
    because you can learn something, for example, MATLAB. It's useful, you can do
    a lot of stuff in MATLAB, but not many employers require it. Be prepared from
    the very beginning to not learn stuff that you don't need or not applicable. So,
    research the job market, and from the very beginning, understand why you do this
    and what you actually have to do.
  sec: 3131
  time: '52:11'
  who: Ksenia
- line: Yeah, that's a great tip. Let's say somebody wants to go into data science
    now. But they don't have enough time or freedom to quit their job and do a masters
    and spend two-three years doing that. Do you have any recommendations for them?
    How should they structure the learning plan to be able to still make the transition
    while working?
  sec: 3209
  time: '53:29'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Part‑time Learning Plan: nanodegrees and structured six‑month paths'
- line: Yes, I think I can give some tips or some recommendations. First of all, start
    to be interested in data analysis and start to apply this at your work already.
    This would be the first step of getting involved in data analysis. Then, when
    you feel that you can do something or you can derive some knowledge, you can use
    it for your decision making process. If you don't have time or opportunity to
    get to university, I would recommend to get involved in some structured courses
    on data science. I didn't do it myself, but I know some people who did it — nano-degree
    from Udacity. It lasts for six months. One friend of mine did it and she got some
    good impression from these courses and she learned a lot.
  sec: 3249
  time: '54:09'
  who: Ksenia
- line: They provide a solid program. The main thing is that they are structured so
    that you will not get lost during the learning process. Six months is not enough
    to be a good data scientist, but at least you can follow this path. Then, when
    you graduate from this, you can get involved in the OpenDataScience course. You
    have to increase the level of complexity steadily. Don't try to jump into the
    most deep topic — it's not going to help you. But try to go with small steps and
    get focused. That's probably how you can approach this path without a university
    degree.
  who: Ksenia
- line: Do you remember which courses your friend took? Was your friend a project
    manager?
  sec: 3379
  time: '56:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: She took economics and yeah, she's quite well in Statistics. I think it was
    the data science nano-degree.
  sec: 3388
  time: '56:28'
  who: Ksenia
- line: I don't know much about economics — what kind of tools they use at work, or
    what they learn. They already know math, and they already know some data analytics.
    At least basics, like Excel.
  sec: 3402
  time: '56:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, she's familiar with statistics as math. It depends on your background.
    Of course, if you're not familiar with math, you have to figure out how to study
    it, because it's the basis.
  sec: 3426
  time: '57:06'
  who: Ksenia
- line: If you don't know math, you need to find a way to pick it. Do you maybe have
    any recommendations — which areas? When we say math, it's a lot of things. You
    can study math for 100 years. Any areas in mathematics that you think are particularly
    useful?
  sec: 3440
  time: '57:20'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Essential Math Topics: probability, statistics, and graph theory'
- line: Probability theory for sure, statistics, graph theory. What else... differential
    equations. That's what I studied. But if you are not familiar with math, studying
    it by yourself from scratch is super challenging. I would probably go for practical
    use cases and start to understand it from practice. Because it's better if you
    do it by yourself, you understand “why?”, “what result?” At least this kind of
    understanding, this kind of way of thinking — that's what you can develop. Start
    with theoretical fundamentals of math and then figure out by yourself how to apply
    it to the problem. Else, it could be extremely difficult.
  sec: 3462
  time: '57:42'
  who: Ksenia
- line: I think you mentioned that a couple of times already — built on your strengths.
    If your strength is in project management, it's planning and domain expertise.
    Use that and try to focus on problems first, and then eventually… What works for
    me is practice —  getting to code as fast as possible, and then trying to code.
    But I'm an engineer and perhaps this is not the best suggestion for project managers.
    But use the skills that you already have. Do you know how they can do this? Let's
    say, a project manager doesn't know mathematics. They don't know how to code.
    But they have a lot of domain expertise. I think you mentioned learning at work
    right?
  sec: 3523
  time: '58:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. If you’re a domain expert, and you know marketing. You know that
    user segmentation is a hot topic and you struggle to find the optimal segmentation
    to run your marketing campaign efficiently and to attract users that you really
    want. You know the problem, and you know what you want to achieve. You know your
    KPIs at least. You already can Google how people usually solve this problem. What
    are the best practices? Just try to go from the problem — because it's your strength.
    Try to use it. Go from the use case that you have at work.
  sec: 3581
  time: '59:41'
  who: Ksenia
- line: What you did is you really thought carefully about how you structure your
    learning. This is what you can also do as a project manager — really think about
    all these bits and pieces. I was taking a course about project management recently
    and I learned about the concept of “critical path”. So it's important to find
    this critical path in your learning. And focus on that.
  sec: 3624
  time: '1:00:24'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Habits: critical path, study techniques, and lifelong learning'
- line: Yeah. I spent nine years studying in my life. The most important takeaways
    — learn how to study. You will be studying all your life. Get used to this. If
    you don’t find an efficient way to structure information, you will be lost. So
    it's important.
  sec: 3661

  sec: 3683
  time: '1:01:23'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Final Advice: contribute to projects, narrow your scope, join communities'
- line: Get involved in the projects — a voluntary project, study project, open source
    project. It doesn't matter. That's what I did. I was active, I was involved in
    some local research, and did some analysis for two years in a row. It's officially
    published on the internet. Many people have been interested in it and it helped
    me to progress. I also got a lot of feedback from people around who wasn't very
    interested in this, and it was really helpful to improve. Another tip so get involved
    in the machine learning class course, from OpenDataScience. Narrow down your scope.
    Don't try to be a generalist, like a data scientist and everything. Try to find
    your strengths. Try to narrow your domain and be active there. When you search
    for the first job, it's also interesting to look at annual surveys — from O'Reilly,
    from JetBrains, and other surveys that explore the data science field and ask
    data scientists, which tool they use, which problems are resolved, and so on.
    You can find these surveys on the internet. I also did some surveys on this —
    analyzed and posted also on the internet. Because it's my time when I started
    to work as a data scientist. I was so interested in “What tools should I learn?”,
    “What positions should I go” and so on. To get some feelings about this, I joined
    some projects and I got some research and analysis on this topic. And communities.
    Join communities. It's important.
  sec: 3687
  time: '1:01:27'
  who: Ksenia
- line: Speaking of surveys, there’s also a good one from StackOverflow, even though
    it's not data science specific. They do a great job. StackOverflow is a very large
    community,  so the amount of information that people share there is amazing. You
    said one from O'Reilly, and another one?

description: 'Discover how project managers switch to data science: master machine
  learning, Python, CRISP‑DM, build a portfolio, and land data roles faster.'
intro: 'How do you move from project management into a data science career — and what
  skills, tools, and courses actually matter? In this episode Ksenia Legostay, Manager/Data
  Scientist at momox GmbH, walks through her transition after four years as a project
  manager into three years researching fraud and anomaly detection and earning a degree
  in data analysis. We cover career foundations, the difference between analytics
  and data science, and a concrete learning strategy: assess strengths, target gaps,
  and build core skills in programming, statistics, and domain expertise. <br><br>
  Ksenia outlines recommended coursework (machine learning, time series, graph analysis),
  online resources including mlcourse.ai, and a practical tools progression from spreadsheets
  and BI (Tableau/Trifacta) to Python and Pandas. She explains applying CRISP‑DM to
  structure projects, starting as a data analyst to build a portfolio, using Kaggle
  and community resources (OpenDataScience, DataTalks), and preparing for production
  with Git, testing, Docker, and Clean Code. Listen for actionable advice on domain
  specialization (fraud detection, node2vec), realistic job search expectations, part‑time
  learning plans, and essential math topics — a clear roadmap for transitioning to
  data science.'
