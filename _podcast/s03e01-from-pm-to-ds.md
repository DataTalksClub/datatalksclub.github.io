transcript:
- line: "This week we will talk about transitioning from project management to data\
    \ science. We have a special guest today \u2014 Ksenia. Ksenia is currently working\
    \ as a data science manager at momox. After four years working as a project manager,\
    \ she turned her career towards data science. She spent three years researching\
    \ fraud and anomaly detection techniques and she earned a degree in data analytics.\
    \ Welcome, Ksenia."

    career journey?
  sec: 180
  time: '3:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: In 2013, I got fundamental education in math, in Russia, in a quite prominent
    university. Then I got another management degree in 2014. Then I spent four years
    as Alexey mentioned in project management. I worked and managed projects in e-services,
    governmental services, traveling, telecom, and other fields. Then I acquired another
    master's degree in Information System Management. In parallel, I was doing research
    for three years and I will explain about it later on in further details. I'm working
    as a data scientist since 2019. Already for three years. Currently I'm working
    in momox and I shifted my focus from fraud detection to marketing. Now I'm applying
    data science techniques in marketing. It's quite entertaining and I really like
    this field so far. There are a lot of optimization challenges, a lot of things
    to predict and improve. It's really a nice place and position to work.
  sec: 189
  time: '3:09'
  who: Ksenia
- line: "Data science attracts many people from quite different backgrounds. For example,\
    \ I am a software engineer. Many people who are working in data analytics also\
    \ go into data science. And sometimes project managers like yourself get interested\
    \ in this. I\u2019m curious, how did it happen for you? When you realize that\
    \ machine learning is such an interesting field?"
  sec: 275
  time: '4:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: "This question that I have heard so many times. I will rephrase it. Before\
    \ going into machine learning, I realized that data analysis is super interesting\
    \ for me. When I worked in project management, I worked closely to development.\
    \ My work was associated with decision making. I was curious, every time when\
    \ I make some decision, is it right or not? Why should I decide it? How can I\
    \ decide it? I don't know. At those times concepts like \u201Cknow your customers\u201D\
    \ or principled in marketing, and customer centric way of thinking have been developed\
    \ and integrated in businesses. People started to learn what customers want. And\
    \ they shared a lot of data that companies have towards their products. You can\
    \ analyze it and it would be not smart to not use this data. In those times, I\
    \ realized that I want to make a decision, which would improve the product, but\
    \ based on the customer's preferences. Because it's not me who decides what direction\
    \ the products should go. But it's the customers who actually drive this business\
    \ and who consumes this product. I think it's super important to analyze data\
    \ and to understand the sense out of this \u2014 what your customer wants. That's\
    \ how I got into data analysis and that's why I became interested in this field."
  sec: 316
  time: '5:16'
  who: Ksenia
- line: You worked as a project manager, and you needed to make all the decisions.
    Usually, to make these decisions, you would rely on data. You realized that analyzing
    data is such an interesting thing. Then you got into data analytics more for supporting
    this decision-making process. Then, after that, you transitioned from data analytics
    to more machine learning and data science.
  sec: 414
  time: '6:54'
  who: Alexey
- header: Data analytics vs data science
- line: "I would say this is the next step. When you analyze data and you feel comfortable.\
    \ This is when you learn some packages to analyze data, to visualize data, to\
    \ deliver your findings and also interpreted on the business level. Then you start\
    \ becoming interested in \u201CWhat\u2019s next?\u201D I derive this knowledge,\
    \ but what will my customer do next? I personally think that data analysis is\
    \ more focused on historical data and deriving a sense of what your customer did\
    \ or how your business went so far. Data science is forecasting the future so\
    \ you try to predict what's going on. I think that you probably can't go to data\
    \ science without transitions into data analytics. Data analysis is the main part\
    \ of any data science project. Because you have to analyze your data \u2014 just\
    \ to build your hypothesis on top of what you observed."
  sec: 450
  time: '7:30'
  who: Ksenia
- line: "We've had a question, \u201Cwhat is the difference between data analytics\
    \ and data science?\u201D And I think you just covered that. If somebody decides\
    \ to study data science, how do they do it? How did it happen for you? You realized\
    \ that there\u2019s a lot of potential in data. That I need to analyze this data,\
    \ I need to understand what's going on? How did you decide which things to study\
    \ to be able to do this?"
  sec: 513
  time: '8:33'
  who: Alexey
- header: Which things to study?
- line: "Firstly, I tried to search through the internet by myself and just find some\
    \ courses on Udemy, and Coursera, and so on. But soon, if you do the same, you'll\
    \ figure out that the amount of knowledge is immense. You\u2019re lost where to\
    \ start. I felt the same when I started to approach this topic. My benefit was\
    \ that I already got familiar with math, statistics, probability theory, and everything\
    \ fundamental that you need for data science. I think that you have to come out\
    \ of your background. If you try to shift your career from backend development,\
    \ you're already experienced in coding, engineering stuff and so on. So you probably\
    \ want to learn some packages for data analysis and also improve your statistical\
    \ knowledge. If you come from data analysis, it\u2019s another pool of information\
    \ that you have to \u043F\u0443\u0435 before. So you have to understand your strengths.\
    \ Then realize what is lacking for you in your skill set, and then add it up to\
    \ your profile. For me, it was like, I\u2019m really fond of fundamental things\
    \ and I already got two degrees and I decided \u201COkay why not get a third one?\u201D\
    \ That's why I choose my path."
  sec: 551
  time: '9:11'
  who: Ksenia
- line: If I understood correctly, you mentioned that you already had a mathematical
    background. You already knew statistics. Is it something you needed to use as
    a project manager? Or this is something that you learn during your studies?
  sec: 652
  time: '10:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I was just lucky that I got math as my first degree. I have to say that
    at 17 years old, I definitely knew what I wanted to do for my life and knew what
    to learn and so on. My math was chosen and I learned it. I probably did not use
    it so extensively in my project management career. But I'm really grateful that
    I had it in my background, because it helped me a lot when I got into this data
    analytics degree. It was super useful. I knew all this stuff and the main thing
    was just to remember it from the bottom of my head.
  sec: 670
  time: '11:10'
  who: Ksenia
- line: So you studied mathematics during your bachelor's degree. You worked as a
    project manager. Then you got into data analytics, you started to learn all these
    things. And then you realized and this stuff that they learned at university was
    actually really useful.
  sec: 715
  time: '11:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, but it wasn't like this. It was like \u201COkay, I know math and it's\
    \ my strengths. How can I improve my profile based on this?\u201D I don't want\
    \ to waste what I already have. Data analysis and machine learning was based on\
    \ what I already have. I want to extend my knowledge. So it wasn't a spontaneous\
    \ decision. Of course, I realized that I will need math for this and \u201Coh,\
    \ okay, I know it already\u201D."
  sec: 734
  time: '12:14'
  who: Ksenia
- line: I guess math was not the only thing you needed. In addition to mathematics,
    what are the other things you needed?
  sec: 769
  time: '12:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: You definitely need engineering skills and ability to code. It's super important
    and we will cover this later on. Another thing, you need to analyze data. Mathematics
    is just a theory. But when it comes to practice, you have to get a feeling of
    why you need it, and how you can apply it. Another thing that I find quite important
    is domain expertise. When you work as a data scientist, you're not working in
    space, in the middle of nowhere. You're working on specific fields. You have to
    study it, and it will be nice if you know business KPIs, if you know what you
    want to achieve in business terms and so on. This is what definitely has to be
    learned.
  sec: 780
  time: '13:00'
  who: Ksenia
- header: Benefits of getting a masters degree
- line: You also mentioned you tried to pick up these skills online by trying to do
    courses on Udemy, Udacity. But it was just too much information, too many courses,
    it was too difficult to choose what to learn, and you decided to get masters for
    this reason.
  sec: 840
  time: '14:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think that these people, they're professionals in education. They definitely\
    \ should know how to teach people. The main reasons that I can summarize why it's\
    \ worth to go to master\u2019s degree. First of all, it's deep enough. From university,\
    \ you can have the deepest knowledge you can find. In books by yourself, but it\
    \ would be difficult. More difficult than just going through a lecture \u2014\
    \ get this feeling and understand the concept and so on, from people that you\
    \ can ask. Deep enough, well structured. People who construct this study plan\
    \ for you, they thought before what should be covered in what order."
  sec: 867
  time: '14:27'
  who: Ksenia
- line: When you start to trace some websites and internet, you can be lost in understanding
    what you should study before and next. Your learning plan should be sequential.
    And universities should know how to do this. Then you have to experience an increasing
    level of complexity. If you just straightaway dive into neural networks and deep
    learning, you probably can feel overwhelmed or even demotivated to proceed. It's
    quite difficult to start with. That's another benefit of going to university because
    it's structured for you at this increasing pace. Then feedback that I already
    mentioned. You have to do some exercises, you can ask for feedback, and so on.
    Another thing that I find really cool here in Germany. During my study, I got
    a position in a research laboratory and I spent three years during my study as
    a researcher. I was lucky that I studied something in a lecture, and I immediately
    applied it in practice. It was so beneficial, because if you learn something new,
    and you don't apply it straightaway, it will fade out of your head. It's a pity
    that you have to learn it again and again in the future. This is why I chose a
    degree.
  who: Ksenia
- line: "What things did you study? I understood the benefits. It's very hard to argue\
    \ with these benefits. I'm wondering what concrete things you studied at university.\
    \ What were the most useful things \u2014 what subjects or courses?"
  sec: 1019
  time: '16:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Because I knew that I wanted to go towards a data science career. At university,\
    \ there was a lot of freedom to choose. I have chosen the hardest courses. I was\
    \ really interested in it. I choose machine learning classes \u2014 supervised\
    \ and not unsupervised. Then artificial intelligent classes. They're quite different.\
    \ They speak about the same problems, but from different angles. Then multivariate\
    \ analysis, statistics, time series analysis, graph theory, networks analysis,\
    \ and all this mathematical stuff. I felt that I knew math and probably I can\
    \ tackle these courses."
  sec: 1038
  time: '17:18'
  who: Ksenia
- line: It was quite focused on data science, because you could select the courses
    you wanted. You knew what you wanted to study and you picked up courses that you
    thought would be super useful for your career, like machine learning, artificial
    intelligence, statistics.
  sec: 1086
  time: '18:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: "From my previous experience as a project manager I observed the problems.\
    \ I know what business needs \u2014 or at least I have an impression that I know\
    \ it. I tried to base my choice of courses on what I observed in the business.\
    \ It is also another benefit to go to a master program after having some experience.\
    \ Because you understand what you will be resolving later on at work and why you\
    \ have to choose this or that."
  sec: 1105
  time: '18:25'
  who: Ksenia
- header: Useful online courses
- line: "I can already see how your background as a project manager was useful. It\
    \ feels like it was very carefully planned \u2014 the way you approached your\
    \ studies. You knew what you wanted to do, and you just went for it. That's really\
    \ cool. I know we already talked about online courses. You had a chance to compare\
    \ these online courses and the courses you took at university. What is your opinion,\
    \ how they're different and what worked better for you?"
  sec: 1135
  time: '18:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can even give advice to people who are interested in choosing between having
    a nanodegree degree online and go into university. It depends on your purpose.
    If you want to pick up some knowledge about a specific package to analyze or visualize
    data, it's enough to go to code academy and pick the first course that explains
    the semantics, gives some examples. And you learn it immediately in one or two
    evenings. But if you really want to understand the deep nature of data science
    concepts, I can recommend some nice online courses that helped me. I didn't do
    it during my university. During the study I took a lot of classes and also I worked
    as a researcher and I had enough practice and knowledge to consume. It was a full
    learning process.
  sec: 1176
  time: '19:36'
  who: Ksenia
- line: "But when I graduated, I realized that sometimes when you do one thing, you\
    \ might forget something else. You have to refresh your knowledge. I do some classes\
    \ on machine learning every year just to refresh my knowledge about everything.\
    \ Because usually at work you don't use everything that you learned. But it's\
    \ still important to have it in mind. I personally find this fundamental online\
    \ class and what I could recommend. There is OpenDataScience community and they\
    \ provide once a year this online course designed by Yury Kashnitsky. It\u2019\
    s a well-structured course that gives you a deep understanding of algorithms and\
    \ also provides a lot of practice. You can communicate with tutors and also get\
    \ feedback. You also communicate with peers and learn from them. I personally\
    \ really like it and guys did nice courses completely for free."
  who: Ksenia
- line: "I'm googling it right now. It's called \u201Cmlcourse.ai\u201D. I also took\
    \ that course and it\u2019s amazing. I also took this course when I was already\
    \ working as a data scientist. When it comes to this understanding of different\
    \ algorithms I think this is a really great course."
  sec: 1320
  time: '22:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: I repeated your experience unconsciously.
  sec: 1346
  time: '22:26'
  who: Ksenia
- header: How project management background can be helpful for the career transition
- line: I already mentioned that your background as a project manager helped you at
    least in structuring the way you approached your education, like deciding which
    courses to take. I think it was really well thought through. Were there any other
    things from your experience as a project manager that helped you?
  sec: 1352
  time: '22:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: I will not go in for myself because I'm not that representative here. But
    I summarized some background that you can transfer from project manager to data
    science. It's not that obvious and I really like to put some time on this question.
    Some people think that it's quite obvious to transfer from data engineering or
    from data analytics to data science. Because you can code, you can analyze data,
    process it. You already know some query languages and so on. But people underestimate
    what benefits you can bring to data science coming from project management.
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Ksenia
- line: "This benefit is definitely in soft skills. You are experienced in planning\
    \ projects. Any data science project is just a project. You have to plan it in\
    \ advance and you already know how to do this. You have to focus on the big picture,\
    \ not to restrict yourself to some details, but you have to plan your roadmap.\
    \ Set some milestones and so on. It's a normal project that you have to set up\
    \ and you have to decompose it. You have to schedule it. You have to plan it \u2014\
    \ and you already know how to do it. Usually it\u2019s done by some lead or manager.\
    \ In data science, being a data science manager, it's the best thing that you\
    \ can do. Because you know both things from your perspective. You also can define\
    \ success measures. It\u2019s quite important and really difficult. People tend\
    \ to define it from their point of view. If you're into business, if you stay\
    \ close to the business decisions, you can identify success in terms of business,\
    \ revenue, margin, or what you can imagine. This is what board and managers really\
    \ like. If you work as a data scientist, you can speak with them in the same language,\
    \ and they can understand you. You are transparent and it's super important \u2014\
    \ this is what I learn from my practice."
  who: Ksenia
- line: "\u201CSpeak the same language\u201D \u2014 this is what I mentioned. It has\
    \ already been covered in one of DataTalks podcasts \u2014 by Vin Vasishtha. He\
    \ spoke a lot about the borders of business language. It was quite a nice talk.\
    \ What I also find useful and borrowed from project management experience is \u2014\
    \ be business oriented. When you make some data analysis, you extract and derive\
    \ some sense, some knowledge. You probably find some outliers, and you plot some\
    \ distributions. Okay. It's nice, but what does it mean? Not for you, as data\
    \ scientists or statisticians \u2014 what does it mean for business? Where do\
    \ you lose money? Where do you earn it? Why you lose some customers? Why are churn\
    \ rates so high? It's really important to put it in the business language, and\
    \ to understand the reason what your distribution shows you in business terms."
  who: Ksenia
- line: "Understanding the business really helps you in problem definitions. You can\
    \ frame your problem before solving it \u2014 [to make it] really clear for everyone.\
    \ It's also entangled with the business understanding. I think that Elena Samuylova\
    \ mentioned it in her talk \u201CHow your machine learning project will fail\u201D\
    . She spoke a lot about problem definition and how it is important. You definitely\
    \ should understand how business works. You, as a project manager, already have\
    \ experience to communicate with stakeholders, to be clear, to deliver the right\
    \ information at the right time, in the right order. This is important also in\
    \ data science, because you build your model not for building it, but to deliver\
    \ value to the business and to communicate it right."
  who: Ksenia
- line: The last thing, but not least, is be proactive. When you are a project manager,
    you have to be proactive. You have to initiate many processes. You have to organize
    people, organize things, and plan and so on. This pro-activity is super nice,
    also in data science, because it fills a gap between technical implementation
    engineering and mathematical concepts to the business. This is where people could
    improve themselves to get on business level. This pro-activity and curiosity about
    business purposes, about a business KPIs, will definitely help to bring your model
    on the next level and estimated in business KPIs. This is what my project management
    experience brings me to data science.
  who: Ksenia
- line: "Thanks for mentioning and some of the presentations we had on DataTalks.Club.\
    \ For those who are listening, or watching, they are on our YouTube channel. You\
    \ can go to our channel after this talk and you will find them. One was a talk\
    \ by Vin Vasishtha about monetizing machine learning. And the other one is from\
    \ Elena \u2014 \u201Chow your machine learning project will fail\u201D. Elena's\
    \ talk is one of our most watched talks [in our channel]. Check it out."

  time: '29:00'
  who: Alexey
- header: CRISP-DM for structuring your projects
- line: I wanted to ask you. You mentioned that one of the things that helped you
    most were planning skills. You were able to plan a project because a data science
    project is a project. Because you have experienced planning projects, you can
    take this experience and apply it to data science projects. For those who do not
    have this background in project management, maybe there is a simple course or
    a book that they can take to get this planning skill? Maybe you have some recommendations
    for that.
  sec: 1778
  time: '29:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Definitely. It's fortunate that it's already developed. I would recommend\
    \ to use the standard of the industry in data mining \u2014 CRISP-DM framework.\
    \ It's really convenient for data science projects. I also use it. It's nicely\
    \ structured. You can structure your project based on the stages of the CRISP-DM\
    \ framework. It's really well designed. it's one way to go. And regardless, if\
    \ you come from project management or from whatever, it's nice to use in data\
    \ science."
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Ksenia
- header: Moving into analytics for PMs and the most useful skills
- line: Yeah, even though it's a bit old methodology, it's 20 years old, it's surprising
    that it still applies to projects these days. Do you say that planning skill was
    the most useful one?
  sec: 1871
  time: '31:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that the most useful skill to have, in my situation at least, is being
    business oriented. Because your business, your stakeholders, expect from you to
    deliver value. Of course, you have to plan. If you can be transparent, if you
    speak the same language, if you're oriented to business KPIs, this brings us more
    success to really deliver value. Not statistical inferences from the data, but
    transferring them to the business terms. This would be the most important thing
    for data scientists. It helps.
  sec: 1892
  time: '31:32'
  who: Ksenia
- line: We have a question from Sandela. Do you think an experienced project manager
    would already be a good fit for a junior data analyst role? Or they still would
    need to learn some things, to pick up some extra skills to be able to work as
    a data analyst?
  sec: 1936
  time: '32:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think I mentioned it, but I will elaborate more on my response. Becoming\
    \ a data analyst after a project manager career is exactly the way to go. You\
    \ see a lot of data. You have to analyze it. If you have to derive some knowledge\
    \ out of this \u2014 and what I would recommend you to start with \u2014 if you're\
    \ already working as a product manager, and you are eager to tend to your career\
    \ towards that data science, just start to analyze data that you already have.\
    \ Because you have your data. You have your project. And I am sure that you know\
    \ how you can improve your decision based on your data."
  sec: 1963
  time: '32:43'
  who: Ksenia
- line: "You can start straight away. It will be amazing, because you will be motivated\
    \ in doing this. Going after your full day of work to home and picking some knowledge\
    \ from some courses \u2014 it's probably not that motivating. Because you're already\
    \ tired, and you want to relax. It's overwhelming. But if you really try to apply\
    \ your knowledge and your skills in data analysis on your work, it's a way to\
    \ go \u2014 it's beneficial for your project management tasks, because you will\
    \ decide better. You will make a better decision based on the data and based on\
    \ the knowledge that you've derived. Try to apply your knowledge already while\
    \ being a project manager and try to get into data analysis as soon as possible."
  who: Ksenia
- header: Going from spreadsheets to SQL and Python
- line: I assume that the usual technology stack, the tools the data analysts use,
    is quite different from what the project manager would use. I imagine that for
    project managers, the tools will be Microsoft Excel or something similar, like

    a lot of stuff in MATLAB, but not many employers require it. Be prepared from
