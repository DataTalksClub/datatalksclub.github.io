short: Why Machine Learning Design is Broken
title: Why Machine Learning Design is Broken
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about why machine learning design is broken. It's a
    very provocative topic and we have a very special guest today to talk about that,
    Valerii. It's not the first time we have Valerii on this podcast. Some time ago,
    I already had the pleasure of speaking with Valerii and it was also about ML systems.
    I think it was one or one and a half years ago – some time ago.
  sec: 126
  time: '2:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it was a year ago, something like that. Maybe you're right. Time flies.
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Valerii
- line: Time flies. For those who don't know anything about Valerii yet, he's the
    VP of Data Science at Blockchain, where he is responsible for leading the company's
    data-driven initiatives. Before joining Blockchain, he worked at different leading
    tech companies like Facebook, Alibaba, and X5 Retail Group. Welcome back to our
    podcast.
  sec: 157
  time: '2:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you very much, Alex. By the way, I am actually joining a new company
    pretty soon. I haven't yet disclosed the name of the company, so it remains a
    mystery. But it will be a significant shift in the industry. Maybe it will be
    a reason for you to invite me for a third time, right? Who knows?
  sec: 185
  time: '3:05'
  who: Valerii
- header: Valerii’s background
- line: Of course. Of course. Yeah, have fun at your new place. Before we go into
    our main topic of ML system design and why it's broken, let's start with your
    background. For those who did not hear the previous interview, maybe you can briefly
    walk us through the career journey you had so far.
  sec: 207
  time: '3:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: All right. Well, it's not an easy question, because it depends on how deep
    we want to dig.
  sec: 229
  time: '3:49'
  who: Valerii
- line: Not too deep because we want to talk about ML design, right? [chuckles]
  sec: 236
  time: '3:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, let''s focus on why I think I am the person
    who can talk about machine learning system design. As you already mentioned, I
    worked in many different companies – most of them are quite prominent: Alibaba,
    Facebook (or the company formerly known as Facebook, known as Meta at the moment)
    Blockchain.com, X5 Retail Group. I was leading more or less-ish 10-, 20-, 40-people
    teams and big-ish like 100-, 200-people teams in different countries, in different
    industries. But my area was almost always the same – it was data analytics and
    machine learning. It was also data and software engineering and computer science,
    but I''d say that machine learning probably is my fauter. And I''ve seen many
    different projects succeed and failed for various reasons. And that''s why a friend
    of mine asked me...'
  sec: 240
  time: '4:00'
  who: Valerii
- line: We decided to write a book, which you already can buy, by the way – it's called
    Machine Learning System Design, with a ton of examples. And to be honest, I didn't
    know the name of the book by the very end, because the publisher was pushing to
    change the title – the original title was Principles of Machine Learning System
    Design. So I was writing the book with a title that I didn't know. This book,
    basically, is a Meta document. Well, the person who worked at Meta, which book
    could this person write? Of course, a Meta book – a Meta document. This document
    describes and tells you how to tackle the problem of machine learning system design
    from, let's say, a manual-like instruction point of view. So what are the chapters?
    What are the milestones? What are the cornerstones? What do you have to cover?
    What do you have to think about? How to create a single, coherent, and easy-to-understand
    document that will help you to succeed? To be honest, I was thinking, “Why do
    we do machine learning design documents?” And the provocative part – and you probably
    already noticed that I like provocative titles – would be that the goal of the
    machine learning system design document is for your project to fail.
  sec: 240
  time: '4:00'
  who: Valerii
- line: What?
  sec: 425
  time: '7:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: To fail as soon as possible – because it's much better for your project to
    fail if you invested two or three weeks than if you invested six or nine months.
    You probably do want to know before than after, right? If you think about that.
    Let's say doing the design doc either increases the chances of your project to
    succeed, or you know that it will fail six months prior to that – that makes sense,
    right? If you know something six months prior to that, that makes sense. You asked
    me for an introduction and I already started to go in the direction of design
    documents.
  sec: 426
  time: '7:06'
  who: Valerii
- header: The goal of the design document
- line: '[laughs] I''m already confused. [chuckles] Maybe we should take a step back.
    So you already said that you''re writing a book and the book is about ML system
    design. The goal of the book, and then in general, when we create a machine learning
    system before we actually start actively working on this – implementing, getting
    data, and all that – we need to create an easy-to-understand document (a meta-document)
    about the system we want to create. Right? An easy-to-understand document that
    is coherent, that is not too big, maybe. Then you said that the goal of this document
    is to make the project fail as soon as possible. This is where I got confused.
    [chuckles] Okay, so we have this document. What''s next?'
  sec: 464
  time: '7:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay, okay. Let's clear that up. When you do a machine learning project, there
    is a lot of uncertainty. Well, that obviously depends on what do you, but if you
    think about that – software projects are not... Well, they're relatively deterministic.
    For example, you can estimate how long it would take to complete something, who
    you need for the team, etc. However, even for software engineering projects, nine
    out of ten times, you could find out that you actually spent 100% more time, and
    you needed twice as many people as you thought at the very beginning. Those are
    much easier to estimate projects compared to machine learning projects. Because
    machine learning projects, at the very beginning, are much more stochastic – you
    don't know what exactly to expect. I mean, of course, if it's something like a
    recommender system, and you've done 10 recommender systems in the same domain,
    you might say you have some understanding of what to expect.
  sec: 519
  time: '8:39'
  who: Valerii
- line: But what I'm seeing is that in machine learning [projects], the amount of
    things that might severely affect the outcome is much higher than in any other
    [types of] projects. Now, what is the idea of a design doc? The thing about that
    is – it is ridiculous to imagine a crew of construction workers creating a building
    without a blueprint, right? Let's say, 100 construction workers gathered and said,
    “Okay, guys! Let's build a school!” And they just start to dig, lay out the foundational
    work, etc., without any blueprints. You can't imagine that, right? That's impossible.
    Nobody will give them any permission to do that. Nobody would give them anything
    to do until they have the proper blueprints. Now, you worked in many different
    companies, and you have plenty of experience, Alex. I have a question for you
    – how many times have you seen a project being started without the proper design
    documentation? Let's say out of 10 times, how many times would you see a project
    without the proper design documentation?
  sec: 519
  time: '8:39'
  who: Valerii
- line: Well, if I'm being honest, like nine and a half? [chuckles]
  sec: 669
  time: '11:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Nine and a half! Crazy, right? Isn't it crazy!? Now...
  sec: 673
  time: '11:13'
  who: Valerii
- line: It depends on what you mean by a “proper” document. But sometimes, projects
    do start without any documents whatsoever.
  sec: 678
  time: '11:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let's say you don't have any document (documentation), surely you don't have
    the “proper” documentation? 100%, right?
  sec: 686
  time: '11:26'
  who: Valerii
- line: '[chuckles]'
  sec: 693
  time: '11:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 693
  time: '11:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: But you see – nine and a half out of ten. Maybe eight, whatever. But it's
    a majority, which is ridiculous. So when I'm saying that the goal of the design
    doc [is for the project] to fail, imagine that every time, there is a building
    to be constructed – people, engineers, architects – conduct some calculations.
    Is it feasible to do? Let's say, someone will come to you and say, “Hey, guys!
    I want a 10-kilometer-tall building.” Then they will try to outline that, they
    will try to do the blueprint, and it will tell you, “Sorry, we can't do that.
    That's impossible.” It is much better to find that out on the blueprint stage
    than right after you've already built like 500 meters, and then you say, “Oh,
    by the way, we can't do that.”
  sec: 694
  time: '11:34'
  who: Valerii
- line: So in that case, if you have the proper documentation, and you outline most
    of the things (corner cases, etc.), then you already have information that will
    help you to understand if you can do that. In that sense, the goal is to fail
    because you want to understand that this is impossible before you invest too much
    time, effort, resources, whatever. But if it's not impossible – if, let's say,
    you don't need a 10-kilometer-tall building, but you need a school. You probably
    still would like to have a blueprint of the school, because my idea of a school
    and your idea of a school – it's still a school, right? But it might be very different.
    What does the school need? That's what the design document tries to outline –
    to solve. “What do we want to have at the end? What do we need to have at the
    end?”
  sec: 694
  time: '11:34'
  who: Valerii
- line: You see, there is a difference between want and need. And “Can we can it or
    not?” That's the thing. Because the situation, both I and apparently, based on
    what you just told me you saw in the industry, [can see that this] is absurd.
    People are trying to build extremely complex solutions without laying the proper
    groundwork.
  sec: 694
  time: '11:34'
  who: Valerii
- line: Yeah. So one of the goals of this design document is to think of all the possible
    ways of how it can go wrong, right? You just think, “Okay, this is what I want
    to do. This is what I need to do.” These two things are already quite difficult.
    And then you think, “Okay, in order to achieve that (in order to build that),
    we need to do this, this, and this. What can go wrong when we try to do this?”
    Maybe the data is missing, maybe a lot of traffic comes in, and then our system
    breaks – things like that. Right?
  sec: 841
  time: '14:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I'd say so. Not only what can go wrong, but also, our decision in the
    early stage definitely affects the next stage. Again, let's take the analogy of
    building a school. If you need a five-story school or fifty-story school (I've
    never seen 50-story schools, but...) you probably need very different things to
    be done at the very beginning. You probably need very different fundamentals for
    the school. The same goes for machine learning. If it's a real-time system, or
    if it's a batch processing system, which you might decide at the very beginning
    – this might really affect the outcome and what you need. So it's not only the
    problems, it's only the possible, let's say, split criteria. But another thing
    is that, as a single person, or even a small team, it's very hard to think about
    everything. Again, it depends on your experience and how typical the project is.
  sec: 876
  time: '14:36'
  who: Valerii
- line: But the good thing is that if you have some kind of ideal blueprint in your
    head, it is very hard to share it with other people. You can even come to other
    people, and look into their eyes, and they still can't download it from your head.
    It doesn't work that way. Unfortunately, maybe Elon Musk and his Neuralink technology
    will solve that, but you can't do that. That's why we had to upload this information
    on paper, or digital paper, like a Google Doc. Then you can share it with many
    different people. Let's even forget about that – the vision you have on day 1,
    and the vision you might have on day 100, you might think that they're the same,
    but you might have forgotten some stuff and... and imagine you now have three
    people on the team. Are you sure you have the same vision if it's all in your
    head? How synchronized are you? I don't think you're very much synchronized. So
    having that on paper helps you to A) Remember B) Outline C) Share with other people
    who will provide feedback. There are many different possible ways to get feedback,
    from, “Actually guys, you don't need an ML system to do that,” which is the best
    [feedback] because, as you know the best code is code that is never written –
    or written with as least code is possible.
  sec: 876
  time: '14:36'
  who: Valerii
- line: The same applies to systems. If you can do something simple, do something
    very simple. An if statement is always better than linear regression, and linear
    regression is always better than a non-linear model, a non-linear model (like
    boosting) is usually better than a neural network, etc. So if it is simple, it's
    good. But then, the last thing is, you can receive all this feedback from the
    people, and they can highlight the things you could miss. And also, if you think
    about that, if you've done that, and you have this culture in the company, that
    means you could also read other people's docs, and enhance and widen your experience
    by at least reading it.
  sec: 876
  time: '14:36'
  who: Valerii
- header: The challenges of machine learning system design
- line: Yeah, that's really great. One of the things that you mentioned was that we
    want to have a shareable document, where we write what we need and what we want
    (and that these are different things). And I think this is one of the common challenges
    that we have when we actually design a system, right? In advance, we don't always
    know what we need – we only know what we want to have, and these things could
    be different. I wanted to talk a bit more about these differences, and in general,
    the common challenges that we have in addition to that when building systems.
  sec: 1100
  time: '18:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, you have a wealth of experience, and you know that one of the hardest
    things is to maintain. Let's say that. You could say, “Oh, I need to do things
    right. I will create a proper document.” And let's say you've done that. On the
    next day, the document you created is obsolete – it's outdated. Because you might
    say, “Oh, actually, we need to change something,” or, “Actually, that's not what
    we needed. Actually, we had a new input.” Then, a week later, a month later, or
    six months later – you would see that the document and the reality diverge. And
    so, it is very hard to maintain the document. Because [things happen] like, “Oh,
    yeah. I will do that. It's just a small thing. I won't put that into the document.”
    What you said is 100% right. Life will change. Software is never done. That's
    why you still have tens of thousands of people working at Facebook, at Google,
    etc. You might say, “Yeah, but Facebook already exists as an app. What do these
    people do?” Or Google, “It already exists as a search.” But no, you always need
    to have people, right? And obviously, if you think about a product like Google
    Search – it probably had a design doc. How many times had it been updated? Many.
    [chuckles] And it's probably still being updated. [Alexey agrees]
  sec: 1141
  time: '19:01'
  who: Valerii
- line: So that's why you have to keep your design doc... a design doc is a living
    thing. Actually, if we come back to the original title Why ML Design is Broken
    – because people think about the design doc as just some artifact, “Okay. It's
    done. Let's mark the box and go to the next stage.” It is never done. It's never
    done because the system is constantly changing. One thing that is broken is that
    even if people have prepared the documentation – which, as we've already discussed,
    is a very rare thing – it becomes outdated pretty soon, if it's not a living thing.
    I remember when I was working at Yandex as a Yandex advisor, the one thing I was
    astonished is the quality of documentation. The documentation there was extremely
    good and well. Instead of taking other people's...
  sec: 1141
  time: '19:01'
  who: Valerii
- line: Well, technically, you can use the word molesting, but now molesting has a
    different context. You still can use it if you're noisy or taking someone's time.
    Technically, if you take a look in the dictionary, you can still use molesting,
    like, “Oh, I molested my co-workers. I took a lot of their time and I was noisy.”
    So yeah, we need to count this. But I'm not a native speaker. Anyway, so you're
    taking the time of your co-workers, you are spending a lot of your time, you're
    spending a lot of time doing improper things, instead of which, you can just go
    read the docs. And that's perfect. That works. That's actually why Stack Overflow
    is such a great thing. Basically, to some extent, it's like a living doc, right?
    You can go there, you can find the answer to your questions, and you leave it
    immediately – everything is good. I just checked the dictionary – you can use
    a “molest” if you're just noisy, or you're trying to get information from someone,
    and they're like, “Stop doing that.”
  sec: 1141
  time: '19:01'
  who: Valerii
- line: '[chuckles] You''re very good at multitasking.'
  sec: 1400
  time: '23:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have to be. But anyway, that's a problem that we don't do that. And that's
    why it's broken. We don't maintain. We think, “Oh, it's done.” However, to some
    extent, it's a design document, it's like code. Code is never done – code is never
    finished. The same applies to design documents. It's never finished. In this sense,
    it is very different from blueprints. Right? You probably won't expect the blueprints
    of the building to change over time. I mean, you might have some additions but,
    usually, they remain the same.
  sec: 1404
  time: '23:24'
  who: Valerii
- line: Hopefully so. If it changes midway through the building – it's already half
    done – and then [somebody says], “Oh, by the way, we decided to add 30 more stories.
    Surprise!”
  sec: 1446
  time: '24:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: “Yeah, let's do that. Actually, now it's not a school, it's not a helicopter
    park.” “What is a helicopter park?” “It doesn't matter. Now, it's a helicopter
    park.”
  sec: 1459
  time: '24:19'
  who: Valerii
- line: Yeah. It's good that we work in the software industry, right? Maybe.
  sec: 1469
  time: '24:29'
  who: Alexey
- header: Yeah, that's reasonable.
- header: The importance of updating the design document and assigning responsibility
- line: If I summarize, one of the reasons why the machine learning design document
    might fail, or why a project might fail, is that we assume that the design document
    is a static thing. We finish it, and [believe] it's not going to change. But it's
    actually a dynamic thing. It changes. Like code, it's never done. It's never finished.
    It requires maintenance. Because requirements change, life changes, and things
    will be different tomorrow, and we need to account for these things. We need to
    go back to our document and update some things. What are the consequences of that?
    Let's say, we're working on a project. We have a design document. We already start
    implementing this. Then when a requirement comes in and we need to update the
    document. What happens then?
  sec: 1477
  time: '24:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: So here's the problem with that. It's very hard to imagine one person working
    throughout the whole system, especially if it's a big project. If it's a one-person
    project, you probably don't even need... Well, I'd say you still need a document
    but it's a different thing. However, if it says a team project, that means you
    probably have different people responsible for different things. Again, I will
    appeal to your experience. Have you ever noticed that, let's say, if you have
    a 10-person team, every person in this team might have a slightly different (or
    very different) understanding of who is responsible for what?
  sec: 1530
  time: '25:30'
  who: Valerii
- line: Quite often. Most of the time, yeah. Unless it's explicitly written somewhere.
  sec: 1586
  time: '26:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right! That's exactly the case – unless it's explicitly written. So the first
    point is, it has to be written somewhere, like, “Person A (Alice) is responsible
    for this. Person B (Bob) is responsible for that, etc.,” You probably would like
    to have some overlap, because you don't want only one person... you don't want
    to have a boss factor being equal to one. But why not have a design doc as a place
    of accountability and areas of responsibility? Now, as soon as you know who is
    accountable for what, and who owns what, those people are now responsible for
    updating their parts of the document. Which makes sense, right? Because they know
    their part of the system the best. It's probable that nobody else knows it better
    than they do. And as soon as there is something new, which might pop up quite
    often, they go to the doc, and they update it. Sometimes it's also nice to notify
    other people, “Oh, by the way, there is a new change coming.”
  sec: 1593
  time: '26:33'
  who: Valerii
- line: Now it's much more feasible than having one person running around the 10 different
    team members (or sometimes 10 different teams because it depends on how big is
    the project – sometimes the project might be really big). You might have 10 people,
    you might have 10 teams, you might have 10 teams with 100 people each, with 10
    subteams each – you probably would like to have this accountability and ownership.
    Then those people can maintain the document distributed way. Because otherwise,
    it's very hard – it's almost impossible – to have a keeper. Maybe you can hire
    a full-time job person whose goal will be to keep the document updated and a living
    thing. We usually call these people “project managers,” right? [chuckles]
  sec: 1593
  time: '26:33'
  who: Valerii
- line: Or... Yeah, product managers sometimes.
  sec: 1721
  time: '28:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I'd say that a product [manager] is for a product. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1725
  time: '28:45'
  who: Valerii
- line: Sometimes it's their responsibility. When the team does not have a project
    manager, then somebody needs to write it. Then it's like an elite project manager
    or an engineering manager. Somebody has to do this, right? To your point, there
    is not always a person whose full-time job is only that.
  sec: 1730
  time: '28:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: There is never a person whose full-time [job is only that]. I have never seen
    that. No.
  sec: 1751
  time: '29:11'
  who: Valerii
- line: I think I remember when I worked at one of the companies – it was quite some
    time ago – there was actually a person responsible for only the documentation.
    But it was customer-facing documentation.
  sec: 1756
  time: '29:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay, yeah. That makes sense. But that's a bit different, right?
  sec: 1769
  time: '29:29'
  who: Valerii
- line: Yeah. That's different. That's very, very different.
  sec: 1773
  time: '29:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's very hard for me to imagine... Well, I mean, it does make some sense
    because it's always... I've been thinking about that for a while. There is always
    an equilibrium – a balance – between efficiency and redundancy. Obviously, having
    a person whose full-time job is only maintaining and keeping the documentation
    seems like a thing that not every company can afford. It doesn't seem like a very
    efficient way of spending your money. On the other hand, if you need redundancy
    – as you know, there is always redundancy or efficiency – if you build a system
    that has to be reliable, you probably think about a lot of redundancy because
    if one machine goes down, you don't want the whole system to go down. That's why
    you'd like something to be double-checked and be in abundance. The question always
    is, “What is more important – efficiency or redundancy?”

  who: Valerii
- line: Okay. I guess that's another reason why, or another challenge or flow, that
    we have in the machine learning system design practice –  we don't have accountability
    included in the design doc. We don't know who is doing what. If we don't have
    that, then who is going to maintain the different parts of the system or different
    parts of the design document? That's another reason why things might go wrong,
    because there's a change, maybe, and nobody documents this change. People just
    talk about this at a meeting (on a daily) saying, “Hey, there is a piece of feedback
    coming from customers, and we need to account for that. We need to do something.”
    And then somebody says, “Okay, I'll just go and create a fix or a workaround.
    I'll fix that thing.” But it doesn't get updated in the documentation, and then
    we have a problem. A solution to that would be that the person who's responsible
    for that area makes sure that the code and the documentation are kept in sync.
    Right?

    were bought by the extravaganza billionaire, who decided that the best idea is
    to lay off most of your engineers. Which is okay, because Twitter was very well
    known (was notorious for) being the place where you can chill out and not work
    at all. However, the thing is that, two weeks later, they had to rehire hundreds
    of those people because it turned out that some of these people were irreplaceable.
    Well, it's not like people are replaceable – it depends on how many people you
    have with a given set of knowledge, which is basically a bus factor. How many
    people have to be in the bus or accident for your project to close? If you have
    this accountability written in the document, it's very easy for you to understand
    what your choking points are. What are the bottlenecks? What are the risk areas?
    Let's say, you find out that there is only one person who knows about A, B, and
    C in your system. That's probably not the thing you'd like to have. Right?

    what you're saying makes total sense, but I'm just wondering how often it actually
    gets implemented. How often can you open a document and see, “Okay, we have these
    risk areas. This part of the project depends only on this person. I can't fire
    that person”

    of some people leaving or not performing – how fragile their project is. Now,
    I have an idea for a startup. I'll tell you [about it]. This startup is like no
    layoffs.com or.ai – I already proposed a name. This is how it works. You create
    the design doc, and in this design doc, you'd like to have a list of people accountable
    for specific errors. And you know that you have to have at least one person (or
    probably two). Now, you try to make a combination to have a maximum amount of
    people being only one or two in these areas, so you can't lay them off. You understand,
    right? Because, let's say you have three people and you have six areas... Or let's
    say, three areas, and three people, and each person knows every area. So that
    means that your boss factor is three. You basically can fire one person, and you
    still have two people knowing each area. But instead of that, now imagine that
    one person knows only one area. Suddenly, your boss factor is one, and you can't
    find anyone. This startup will provide you with a design doc that allocates people
    to specific areas, so you can't fire them. That's an idea that I'm just giving
    to the world.

- header: The importance of modularity for the design document
- line: Okay. I think one of the things we talked about quite extensively here is
    that things change – life will change, and we need to account for that. Our design
    document has to be non-static – it has to be a dynamic thing. So how do we build,
    or how do we design a machine learning system in such a way that it's lean, it's
    maintainable, it's extensible? When a new piece of requirement comes, we can actually
    go there, know who owns it, and this person can just go and update it. How do
    we do this?
  sec: 2210
  time: '36:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: So the answer is very simple, right? You go and you buy our book. [Alexey
    chuckles] You have a design doc outline as an example for two different things.
    Probably later, we will create a course that people can buy and learn how to do
    that. However, the answer to that... Well, obviously, you'd like to incorporate
    meaningful things into your design, right? You might want to have chapters. You'd
    like to have a modular structure – module number one, module number two, module
    number three. Therefore, if something is added, it's not a monolith – it's just
    another module that you can add. Then you know, again, who's responsible for what.
    Nobody's preventing you from even writing a specific test to see what the last
    time a specific chapter was updated and have some kind of alarms [to tell you
    that]. Again, it depends on how far you'd like to go. You know that you can link
    tickets in Jira, for example, and any other task tracker, and your GitHub or whatever
    you have as a code version control system. They say it might be done because as
    with any mete document, you can do whatever you want. You can reuse a piece of
    code.
  sec: 2249
  time: '37:29'
  who: Valerii
- line: Let's say, if you know that the last time the code for this chapter was updated
    was a week ago, but the last time the chapter was updated was a year ago – something
    is wrong. Again, it always depends on how important that is to you. Basically,
    what I prefer is just to have a clear structure – a clear outline of the design
    doc. The design has been split into chapters. Each chapter or subchapter has its
    owner (or maintainer, or person accountable for that) and then you have a list
    of people working on the project. What areas do they cover? And what is the coverage
    factor for each area – how many people can cover the specific area? One of the
    most important things is that, in some companies, for engineers, they review how
    many divs (we call them divs in Meta) or pull requests, as you probably call them,
    usually – how many code changes the engineer has made. Sometimes that's a metric.
  sec: 2249
  time: '37:29'
  who: Valerii
- line: I think that another important metric is how many times the design doc has
    been updated. If this metric will be incorporated... Basically, if you have engineering
    excellency as your performance review X, it makes sense to incorporate the design
    doc there as well, because what is usually incorporated [there] is code divs,
    and code reviews. If you think about that, design doc reviews are even... Well,
    it's hard to say more important, because it's very hard to assess what is more
    important. But they're also very important.

  who: Valerii

  sec: 2457
  time: '40:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it impacts the full system. But again, you can't say, “Oh, I updated
    three lines. It is ten times more impactful than the actual code, which is doing
    that.” Do you see? As soon as a metric becomes a goal, it ceases to be a good
    metric, but we need to incorporate something like that in the performance review.
    Because as soon as it is incorporated, people will start chasing it. But they
    have to have some incentive to do that.
  sec: 2461
  time: '41:01'
  who: Valerii
- line: So what you're saying is that in order to be able to maintain our documents,
    [keep them] in good shape, and in order to make them extensible, it's not enough
    to just have a clear structure – we also need to give a bit of an extra incentive
    for people to do that. For example, we can make sure that their performance review
    depends on how good they do this.
  sec: 2494
  time: '41:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is good, because if you only have the code, that's only a part of the
    job, right? You know that some companies, they don't even do proper code reviews,
    which is bad. People are struggling, saying, “Oh, how can we incorporate that?
    How can we work on that?” So code reviews make sense. Nobody asks, “Oh, why do
    we spend time and extra effort on code review?” You do that to check if the code
    is correct, and to increase your bus factor – because you want to have more people
    that have at least some knowledge of the code base. The same applies to design.
    It actually doesn't matter if it's machine learning system design or just system
    design. You'd like as many people being there as you could, knowing and working
    on that. It also gives them an extra, let's say, opportunity for growth.

- line: We have a question that is quite on-topic to what we discussed. That question
    is, “Is there a universal template of a machine learning system design document?”
    I think it's related because you mentioned that a design document should be modular
    – there should be chapters, and it should follow a clear structure. So maybe you
    could give us an example of what such a design document can look like. What are
    the things there? Maybe you could use some examples, without making it too abstract.
  sec: 2575
  time: '42:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that it's very hard to say if there's one template that's like “the
    best”. Well, apparently, these templates exist in our book. Right. It has the
    best in the world – you can't find... There are two design doc examples, but they
    follow the same template.
  sec: 2611
  time: '43:31'
  who: Valerii
- line: Uh-huh. Okay.
  sec: 2631
  time: '43:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: So if you don't want to spend like 30 bucks on our book (which actually brings
    me a lot of sorrow to find that out) you can just... if you can share the link
    to our book, what people can do is just read the outline. Our book structure is
    built as a design doc itself. Every chapter basically describes a chapter you
    would expect to have in the real design doc. We discussed why it's important,
    what has to be there, what can't be there, and at the end, we provide two examples.
    But basically, you take the outline, it's already kind of an example of the design
    doc itself. Again, it depends. For example, we were thinking about having 16 chapters,
    and then an appendix. But then it turns out that the appendix would be as big
    as the book itself, so we decided to keep it for a second book. But basically,
    you can go there, and you can find out the outline, like, if there is a problem,
    preliminary research, design document loss function and metrics, gathering datasets,
    validation schema, baseline solution, error analysis, training pipeline, features
    and feature engineering, reporting, integration, reliability and monitoring, serving
    and inference optimization, ownership and maintenance. So you see, some of the
    things we already discussed, like even ownership and maintenance are parts of
    this design document. Integration.
  sec: 2633
  time: '43:53'
  who: Valerii
- line: Basically, there are 16 chapters, and every four chapters are grouped into
    aggregated parts. Part one – preparations, part two – early stage, part three
    – intermediate steps, part four – integration growth. But obviously, you can add
    other chapters. For example, you could say, “Oh, we need to add a module on fairness.”
    It's actually something we were hoping to cover in the appendix, but it turned
    out that we already wrote too many words. Because the book has to be between 100-220,000
    words, and it's already too big for the appendix. But maybe the book will be a
    successful one. Then we'll see if the second will come.

- header: The importance of monitoring and fallback solutions
- line: Okay. So keeping my fingers crossed. So my question was also a bit of... what
    I was struggling with sometimes is maybe having some examples. I guess right now,
    if somebody wants to have an example, you mentioned that in the book, there are
    two examples. I think we also talked about that with Arseny, who is the co-author,
    like a month ago, maybe more. So maybe we can talk about an example but also think
    about how things could go wrong? Do you have, maybe in your practice, things that
    went wrong? I assume that you do. Maybe, you could tell us what the reasons were?
  sec: 2810
  time: '46:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: 100%. In our book, we covered that in the chapter on reliability and monitoring,
    and the fallbacks. Basically, it doesn't matter how good your system is, it will
    go down sooner or later. Google went down, Facebook went down, AWS went down,
    and Twitter is going down. [chuckles] Twitter went down. You know, just this weekend,
    Twitter has a lot of issues with rate limiting and apparently DDoSed itself. Let's
    say that there are many things that might go wrong in an ML system. There are
    two things you can do. You can monitor what's going on. Is it a data drift? Is
    it an error in the data? Is it a concept drift? Is the prediction drift? Or whatever.
    And the second question is how you could react to that. You might have a fallback.
    Let's say your model went crazy, but you have some other solution that is worse
    than the model, but better than nothing. So if you have that, you can fall back
    to that solution, but you can only do that if you know that your model went crazy
    in the first place.
  sec: 2866
  time: '47:46'
  who: Valerii
- line: If you don't know that something's wrong, you can't react. Basically, we spent
    30 pages writing about what might go wrong, how to detect that, and how to react
    to that. Another thing I can suggest to people who are interested in this topic
    – there is a website called Evidently AI. Basically, it's a startup (a company)
    that has a library (a framework) for monitoring. Monitoring, meaning model quality,
    data drift, target drift, data quality, etc. They have a very comprehensive set
    of blog posts and articles which you can read. They can tell you what might go
    wrong, how to detect that, and some basic stuff you can do to react to that. But
    detection is the first step. Because if you can't detect that, that's it – finish.

    like two years ago. The title of your talk was, “Why Your Machine Project Will
    Fail,” where she outlines (describes) pretty much what you said. So monitoring
    is important, and most of us have heard that, probably. I'm wondering – okay,
    we know that we need to monitor. We need to have a fallback solution, and we need
    to know that if our machine learning model goes crazy, we can actually fall back
    to our...
  sec: 3061
  time: '51:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let's say that it might be a model problem, it might be... because we mentioned
    four things – data quality, model quality, concept drift, and prediction drift
    – there are many different things.
  sec: 3096
  time: '51:36'
  who: Valerii

    things have in our design document? And how do we actually structure them?
  sec: 3107
  time: '51:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, we think that accounting for that is a part of... Let's say, it will
    split the design doc into four parts, like preparation, early stage, intermediate
    steps, and integration growth – we think that reliability monitoring and fallback
    is the integration and growth part. It's definitely not preparation. It's definitely
    not early stages. It's even not intermediate steps. It's something where you already
    have a system, it works, it has pipelines. You'd like that to be reliable, and
    you'd like to have a fallback. Basically, your whole focus at the end is on reliability.
    Remember – efficiency, redundancy. Reliability, to some extent, is redundancy.
    You might have three different fallbacks depending on what is broken. Maybe some
    data is damaged, but you have a set of three critical features, and they are not
    affected.
  sec: 3119
  time: '51:59'
  who: Valerii
- line: You still might have a model, which is much less sophisticated but still better
    than nothing. Let's say, it's two if statements. If the data is completely affected
    or corrupted, let's use three or two if statements. If even that doesn't work,
    let's use a constant placeholder. As you see, you have four solutions to use only
    once – a lot of redundancy, but a lot of stability and reliability. But yes, that's
    something that has to be addressed. If you think about that – if you take a look
    at least in our part four outline – reliability and monitoring, and ownership
    and maintenance, are all about these fallbacks concerning what might go wrong.
    It might go wrong from the technical side, it might go wrong from the people side
    – how do you take these into account?
  sec: 3119
  time: '51:59'
  who: Valerii
- line: Okay. I want to summarize everything we talked about so far. We started by
    discussing a design document –  a machine learning design document. We talked
    about what we needed to document there – what we need, what we want. Then we started
    talking about why some things might go wrong. One of the things we need to keep
    in mind is that the design doc has to be a dynamic thing – a dynamic document.
    It's not a static thing. Then another thing we mentioned was that we should know
    who is accountable for what. If there is no accountability mentioned in the design
    document, then nobody knows what they're responsible for and then nobody will
    keep the document updated.
  sec: 3247
  time: '54:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Worse than that. It's not that nobody knows – people think wrongly. People
    think, “Oh, somebody's responsible for that,” and this person thinks something
    else. So this is even worse than that.
  sec: 3301
  time: '55:01'
  who: Valerii
- line: Right. Okay. So we need to think about that and explicitly document who is
    accountable for what. Then another thing that we need to keep in mind is that
    the document should have some sort of modular structure – it should have chapters
    – and we should know the last time each chapter (when each model) was updated.
    Thus, we know how outdated the document is in general, and how much effort we
    put into maintaining it. So that's another thing.
  sec: 3313
  time: '55:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Towards the end, we discussed that we sometimes forget to think about monitoring
    and there are many things that might happen, so we need to account for that too,
    but maybe at a later stage – the growth stage (I think, I don't remember). Or
    the one before that – the integration stage. Basically, at some point, we will
    need to think about that, and we need to keep that in mind. Did we not talk about
    something else – something that is equally important to these four things?
  sec: 3313
  time: '55:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Look, everything is important, right? Because every project is quite unique.
    For example, one common pitfall, which probably both you and I have seen, is when
    people try to do something complex and sophisticated, instead of working with
    a simple baseline solution that can help them to test the hypothesis, to iterate
    very quickly, and to see what an extra mile can bring. Not that many people do
    that and that's extremely important – to build the baseline solution. But if you
    don't build a baseline solution, it doesn't mean that your project will fail,
    but you might spend an extra three months of work, which is probably not great.
    Let's say that. We decided to focus on these 16 chapters because we think they
    are important. We obviously haven't gone through all of them because it'll take
    longer than an hour. But what I suggest for you guys to do is to just take a look
    at the outline – it's free to look at. You can then further dive into any specific
    topic you'd like. We've already spoken about Evidently AI, where you can dive
    into the specific topic of reliability and monitoring. As soon as you have this
    idea of these chapters being important, then you can start digging further into
    them, and discuss them in your own design documents.
