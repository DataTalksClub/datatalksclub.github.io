short: Interpretable AI and ML
title: Interpretable AI and ML
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about bringing together research and industry and how
    explainable and interpretable machine learning and AI fit into it. We have a special
    guest today, Polina. Polina is a data scientist at SAP. She's passionate about
    bringing current machine learning research to business. In her PhD dissertation,
    she created a framework for churn prediction and this framework uses organizational
    trust theory and explainable machine learning methods. We will be mostly talking
    about explainable ML, but I'm also very curious about organizational trust theory.
    I have no idea what it is. Maybe we will talk about that. Welcome to our podcast!

  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you so much for the warm welcome. Very excited to be here.
  sec: 112
  time: '1:52'
  who: Polina
- line: We're pretty excited to have you here. And as always, the questions for today's
    interview were prepared by your Johanna Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, for your help.
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Alexey
- header: Polina's background
- line: So let's start. Before we go into our main topic of interpretable/explainable
    AI and ML, let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career
    journey so far?
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: So it's maybe also going to be further covered in the industrial PhD. But
    basically, I think the biggest element of my, or the earliest element of my journey
    as a data scientist is that I did an industrial PhD with SAP at the University
    of Mannheim, merging together sociology and data science. I also identify myself
    as a computational social scientist. Then after the PhD, I started as a data scientist
    at SAP. What I do day-to-day, I think – I used to always cover it, or call it
    end-to-end data science. Basically, from the point where somebody comes up with
    an idea to bringing a productive machine learning model to life and then maintaining
    it.
  sec: 139
  time: '2:19'
  who: Polina
- line: This is kind of what I can work on and that's what I cover in my job at SAP.
    I'd like to say, actually, that's an interesting point – I listened to one of
    your talks recently, I think at the Arize:Observe conference, and you were calling
    it a full stack data scientist. So I learned a new thing. [chuckles] And now I
    think I can identify with that as well. And one very important point that I have
    to mention – I described my job and this is something that I can say publicly,
    but anything further, I should not talk about. Everything I talk about here is
    me as a private person, not SAP, not an opinion of my employer. Just wanted to
    say that.
  sec: 139
  time: '2:19'
  who: Polina
- line: My Zoom crashed. Apologies for that. I don't know where it stopped. I remember
    we talked about a full-stack data scientist, and you told me that you learned
    that in the talk I gave the other day. Then after that, I think it dropped.
  sec: 397
  time: '6:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. After that, I mentioned that all of the opinions that I voiced are my
    own and not that of my employer and that I'm not going to be talking about the
    actual job that I do, because obviously, I'm here as a private person. So that's
    what I have to mention, just for the clarity of the situation.
  sec: 418
  time: '6:58'
  who: Polina
- line: Yeah, it's funny that you mentioned this full-stack data scientist term. When
    I first gave this talk like two or three years ago, it was a thing because the
    role of an ML engineer was not yet that developed. It wasn't that common. And
    MLOps wasn't that common either. So data scientists often needed to do everything
    end-to-end. There were, of course, data scientists who specialized more into I
    know the business side or specialized more in software engineering. But now, with
    ML engineers, data engineers, and other people working together on a team, I see
    that there are fewer full-stack data scientists, yet you say that you are one.
    I'm wondering how many of these people like you see in the industry.
  sec: 439
  time: '7:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: How many are still left? [chuckles]
  sec: 497
  time: '8:17'
  who: Polina
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 498
  time: '8:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think it's also kind of my impression of what I observe on LinkedIn
    and how people's career journeys are developing, I think it's getting more specified.
    Maybe I would be then going closer to the business side and to understanding the
    business problems, compared to some people who develop more towards this MLOps
    specialization. So I do see that. But I think it's kind of where my roots were,
    in my early career, especially in the PhD project as well – I was the only person
    managing my own PhD project, and I was facing a lot of points, so it was very
    hard to bring many things together. So that's, I think, a simple explanation of
    how I first came to be a full-stack data scientist. [chuckles] In a PhD, you're
    supposed to do many things independently.
  sec: 499
  time: '8:19'
  who: Polina
- header: How common it is for PhD students to build ML pipelines end-to-end
- line: Is it a common situation when a PhD student actually needs to do everything
    end-to-end? Because I think it is, right? That's kind of the point. Or is there
    usually help?
  sec: 559
  time: '9:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it really depends. My PhD project was actually an applied project
    for the company. There, of course, I faced this duality of, on the one hand, I
    have the scientific elements to it – I have the research – and then on the other
    hand, I have actual stakeholders and people who would, in the end, be using the
    model and benefit from it. So of course I was also facing all of the things that
    don't necessarily belong to a PhD project. But there are so many PhD projects
    – so many industrial PhD projects – so I think I cannot say it's 100% a must,
    but it was a big learning for me.
  sec: 570
  time: '9:30'
  who: Polina
- line: So the answer is, “It depends,” right? [Polina agrees] It depends on the project,
    it depends on the group where you work, and many, many other things.
  sec: 616
  time: '10:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: But really, I didn't want to phrase it this way, because “it depends” is an
    answer to everything.
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Polina
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah. Right. [chuckles]'
  sec: 628
  time: '10:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: So I still want to try better.
  sec: 629
  time: '10:29'
  who: Polina
- header: Simultaneous PhD and industry experience
- line: Actually, I wanted to talk more about your PhD at the end. But I think now,
    it's a perfect segue to actually talk more about that. You said that it was an
    applied project for the company – for SAP, as I understand. There was a scientific
    element and in addition to that, there were stakeholders that you needed to manage.
    For a usual academic PhD, the output would be like three papers, and then a dissertation
    based on these papers. But for you, it was different, right? In addition to the
    papers, you also needed to deploy a project, to show the business value. Am I
    correct?
  sec: 634
  time: '10:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Exactly.
  sec: 675
  time: '11:15'
  who: Polina
- line: Does it make it more difficult because you kind of have two goals?
  sec: 676
  time: '11:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think this would be a situation or a problem that every industrial
    PhD student faces, where on the one hand, you have the research interests, and
    maybe your university supervisor, who pushes you into bringing the research further
    on. And on the other hand, you would have the industrial benefit. There might
    be a bigger or a smaller overlap as well, if it actually is the same project,
    or if it's two completely different ones. So for me, the overlap was rather huge
    but, of course, there were elements that were only in the research part – only
    in the output text, basically, in the dissertation. And, of course, a lot of the
    things that I learned during pushing things in production, for example, were not
    covered in my dissertation, so they were industry-only.
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Polina
- line: So you did not describe in your dissertation how exactly you used Kubernetes,
    or whatever framework, for deploying models – you did not write anything about
    that.
  sec: 742
  time: '12:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Maybe to get closer to the topic, for everybody to understand more
    what I did – my dissertation was focused on studying the relationship between
    a software as a service provider and their customers. Basically, I looked into
    how trust is built up, theoretically, and then tried to see it in reality. I also
    wanted to understand how this trust element impacts the continuation of the relationship.
    Basically, if you phrase it in machine learning problem terms, then it's a churn
    problem. So basically, predicted churn was the model.
  sec: 753
  time: '12:33'
  who: Polina
- line: For the organizational trust things, I think, of course, a lot of things were
    just describing the theories and not exactly immediately relevant to the industry.
    If you put it this way, actually, for the text of my dissertation, how I bring
    it to production was not necessarily relevant. It was a tiny part of my defense.
    During the defense, I mentioned that it is actually live, but it's not something
    that has a chapter or something like that.
  sec: 753
  time: '12:33'
  who: Polina
- line: So it was a tiny part in the dissertation, but I imagine the actual work...
    I don't know what your experience was like, but from my experience, this is usually
    what takes most of the time.
  sec: 832
  time: '13:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'It was a big learning curve for me, because I came from this kind of idealistic
    perspective, maybe, that whatever insights I generate – anything could be very,
    very beneficial to the industry. Then I realized that there is just so much more
    to it and that a real data science project is actually more complex. Also managing
    it completely is a big challenge. Yeah, so that was a big learning for me. I think
    maybe that''s why it was more work as well. Maybe a fun story: The first time
    I was discussing pipelines around machine learning engineering, I was basically
    at the stage where it''s like, “Data comes in, I want it there,” but I was not
    understanding maybe... no, I do, but I wasn’t understanding the complexity of
    how things in the industry can actually work.'
  sec: 842
  time: '14:02'
  who: Polina
- line: Also, it means that there is an additional risk factor. For a usual PhD, the
    typical risk factor could be that you do not find what you wanted to find and
    then it's like, “How do you write your PhD if you could not prove that (in your
    case) organizational trust theory can be applied to churn prediction.” So that's
    one element. Then another element, even if it theoretically works, will it work
    in practice? So you have two things that could go wrong, as opposed to a usual
    PhD, where it's maybe less risky. Am I right?
  sec: 911
  time: '15:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think so. I had a lot of research showing that it can work. And there are
    also a lot of interesting studies showing other data and translating it into industrial
    terms. So I think, for the PhD, there is a lot of risk anyways. I would not say
    that there is more risk in this case. Probably, at the level of a PhD, it's as
    much risk as it can get. It either works out and you get the title or it doesn't.
    I think that's actually kind of the same for all PhDs. Maybe, to turn it into
    a positive direction, it's also double support – or was a double support for me
    – because my supervisor at the university was very understanding of the setup
    and was also helping me to find the elements of value that I can get to the company.
  sec: 956
  time: '15:56'
  who: Polina
- line: My team in the company was also very, very supportive of my PhD. I think that's
    kind of where, if it all fits together nicely, then it's actually a lot to learn
    and it gives you two things. First of all, there's the research experience, but
    then still a lot of work experience as well. There's a reality check, to be honest,
    because I think my original motivation for doing it in the industry was that I
    didn't want to just write and then put it on a shelf, or just publish something
    and never know if anybody got anything out of it. Here, I can actually see that
    it is applied and there is a lot of learning for everybody, including me.
  sec: 956
  time: '15:56'
  who: Polina
- header: Support from both the academic and industry sides
- line: You mentioned that you had a supervisor from the university side. Was there
    also a supervisor from the company side?
  sec: 1077
  time: '17:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not immediately. It's also different in different industrial PhD setups –
    sometimes there is a supervisor. In my case, it was basically that the teams that
    I worked with were interested in the project, but there was not necessarily somebody
    who would just supervise me completely.
  sec: 1086
  time: '18:06'
  who: Polina
- line: But there were some stakeholders, right? Still, somebody from the company
    side would guide you and say, “Okay, this is not what we need. This is not what
    we meant. We want a different thing.” It was like that, right?
  sec: 1108
  time: '18:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. Basically, my stakeholders were helping a lot.
  sec: 1121
  time: '18:41'
  who: Polina
- line: How did this actually work? Were you talking to them every day? How often
    did you get feedback from them? Were you talking to other team members? How did
    it look day-to-day?
  sec: 1126
  time: '18:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Day-to-day, I think it was just a data science project. Just the data science
    work that you can imagine – regular calls with stakeholders. I think that's not
    that much different from what every data scientist who has business facing roles
    does every day. Of course, there was a lot of exchange in the team. Again, very
    typical for data science teams to just talk to each other. [chuckles] No secret
    information revealed here.
  sec: 1145
  time: '19:05'
  who: Polina
- line: I think what was different for me was that I also had a chance to attend conferences
    or summer schools. Again, that was this merging together of the industry and the
    university lifestyle. Basically, I could go to a conference or to summer school,
    and then I could bring my ideas from my project and then learn on the go from
    the research. That was a very interesting experience.
  sec: 1145
  time: '19:05'
  who: Polina
- line: And by conferences, you probably mean academic conferences, not industry,
    right?
  sec: 1211
  time: '20:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Academic conferences.
  sec: 1216
  time: '20:16'
  who: Polina
- line: The ones where people publish papers, print posters, and then discuss research.
  sec: 1218
  time: '20:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 1225
  time: '20:25'
  who: Polina
- line: Summer schools are a lot of fun. I wish there were more things like that.
    They're not very common in industry, I guess. They're usually for students, right?
  sec: 1228
  time: '20:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Also, my PhD was partially during COVID. The first year I started, it
    was 2019, so I did summer school, then. [chuckles] And then 2020-21, it was virtually
    impossible to have any real-life summer schools. But I'm also kind of thankful
    for the situation of being locked down because it forced me to write a lot. [chuckles]
  sec: 1237
  time: '20:37'
  who: Polina
- line: Balancing the PhD and industry sides of the projects
  sec: 1237
  time: '20:37'
  who: Polina
- line: Okay. But did it mean that, in addition to your work as a full-time data scientist,
    you had some extra work because you also needed to write it all down? Or was it
    balanced? Your team knew that this is actually your PhD project, so then you could
    spend time saying, “Hey, this week, I'm actually working on a paper. I'm not working
    on the project.”?
  sec: 1264
  time: '21:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was very balanced. It, again, actually depends on the setup. In my setup,
    it was balanced, but for other people... Also, in academia, I think some people
    are working on projects, and then on top, on their PhD. When there are deadlines,
    you're just on your own with the deadline and it's you and your personal time
    management. I think that's probably shared among all PhD students – not specific
    to this industrial setup.
  sec: 1291
  time: '21:31'
  who: Polina
- line: I remember when I was getting my Master's degree at TU Berlin, I saw the PhD
    students all of a sudden realized that the deadline is soon and then they would
    spend 24 hours, 7 days a week on just writing the paper. They did not look very
    good when I met them at the university. [chuckles] They were very stressed.
  sec: 1323
  time: '22:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The stress level, I think, for any PhD student... At some point, it's
    just your project and you want to get it out in the best possible way and share
    the experience. [chuckles]
  sec: 1350
  time: '22:30'
  who: Polina
- line: So it was an explicit decision that you made, that you wanted to do an industrial
    PhD project. You didn't want to do just a PhD, you wanted to immediately apply
    this research at the company. How did you come up with this realization? How did
    you learn that this is what you want to do?
  sec: 1365
  time: '22:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: In my Bachelor's and my Master's, I was already very interested in doing data
    analysis, basically, but for companies – or with data that can bring something
    valuable to someone. I did a couple of projects that were also for companies during
    my Master's in seminar work. Then I realized that I'm interested in data that
    is just very often owned by companies, so if I actually want to develop in the
    area that I think is most interesting for me, then I want to go there. Also this
    idea of not just putting the PhD on the shelf and that's it – I think that is
    very important.
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Polina
- line: So, you already had some connection to the industry and you did not want to
    lose this connection, but you still wanted to do a PhD. Then you figured out that
    you can actually combine both – you can stay in academia and work on industry
    projects.
  sec: 1444
  time: '24:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. And I think both can actually learn a lot from each other. I still
    think I would not have done it differently. I would have done the industrial PhD
    if I was asked again.
  sec: 1460
  time: '24:20'
  who: Polina
- header: How common the industrial PhD setup is and how to get into one
- line: How common is this setup? For example, I know that – again, at TU Berlin,
    where I studied a long time ago – I don't remember that the group where I was
    had such a direct connection with industry. Usually, the company usually gives
    some money to the group for them to work on something, and then they give some
    data. Then they're like, “Okay, bye. Now figure this out and then come back to
    us in five years,” something like that. That was my feeling of how this thing
    worked. My question is, how typical is what you had, in general?
  sec: 1478
  time: '24:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it depends very much on the industry, and very much on the subject
    of the PhD. I am a social scientist by education (by training) so it's very not
    common for social science, or rather unusual. I think in other disciplines, it's
    probably more common. Somehow I'm thinking about chemistry, but do not quote me
    on that. I think there, it might be more common to have a collaboration. But yeah,
    if any of the listeners are interested in finding the PhDs, you can go (at least
    in Germany) for the big companies. SAP, obviously, has this setup sometimes. Also,
    I think Siemens Bosch is offering this. I think the automotive industries in Germany
    also have this industrial PhD setup, certainly, at the moment, in the area of
    machine learning. If you're interested, just do a bit of research on their job
    seeking websites.
  sec: 1524
  time: '25:24'
  who: Polina
- line: What I also think you can look at is university websites. Sometimes they advertise
    such cooperation programs, or industry-related PhDs. I think the Technical University
    in Munich definitely has a page that offers that. But again, it is always a question
    of needing to find a professor that supports this collaboration. And in a company,
    it also must fit some project. It's not exactly common for companies to just hire
    scientists to run around their own and do wild things. But if it fits together,
    then... There are actually more opportunities than I thought there were. As you
    can see, I'm asked this quite often, [chuckles] so I already did some research
    like, “Okay, what can I recommend? Are there any companies that are doing that?”
  sec: 1524
  time: '25:24'
  who: Polina
- line: So if I wanted to check what possible projects I can do with SAP, what kind
    of Google query would you say I need to use? “SAP machine learning and industry
    PhD,” something like that?
  sec: 1661
  time: '27:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I basically used “PhD,” or “doctoral student,” or “doctorates” in the
    search, because I think that's how the positions are frequently advertised. But,
    again, each team can define it in different ways. I think a query with a PhD student
    or a PhD research position should work.
  sec: 1674
  time: '27:54'
  who: Polina
- line: Do they require you to speak German? Or is English sufficient?
  sec: 1702
  time: '28:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: This so much depends on the company and, again, also the team. I think there
    is no 'Yes' or 'No,' over here.
  sec: 1707
  time: '28:27'
  who: Polina
- line: So it depends, right? [Polina agrees] You just find a position and they probably
    say if you need to speak German or not. Okay.
  sec: 1716
  time: '28:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: My fingers are quickly Googling, I think Daimler required German for some
    positions. But... yeah, it's very, very dependent on the specific team.
  sec: 1725
  time: '28:45'
  who: Polina
- line: Was your dissertation in English or German?
  sec: 1737
  time: '28:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was in English.
  sec: 1739
  time: '28:59'
  who: Polina
- line: English. Because I know that in some countries, you cannot write in English
    – your dissertation has to be in the language of the country, university, whatever.
    But I know that in Germany, that's not the case. In Germany, you can publish either
    in English or in German. I don't know about other languages. Maybe you can do
    it in Latin, or? [chuckles]
  sec: 1741
  time: '29:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: In Latin, I'm not sure. Because in what language would you defend if you are
    writing in Latin? Not sure, but... I think now that the research is basically
    very international, a lot of universities actually expect you to publish in English.
    So I think that's what motivates this idea that you can actually submit an article-based
    dissertation in English as well if that's exactly the expectation for publication.
  sec: 1762
  time: '29:22'
  who: Polina
- header: Organizational trust theory
- line: I also wanted to talk about the content of your dissertation. At the beginning,
    when introducing you, I said that you were developing a framework for churn prediction
    that used organizational trust theory and explainable and interpretable ML. So
    what is organizational trust theory?
  sec: 1792
  time: '29:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] I think this will need an episode of the podcast of its own because
    you can actually look at trust from so many angles. Why I say “organizational
    trust theory” is because very often, when people say “trust,” they mean interpersonal
    trust – basically, “I trust you as a person.” But in organizational trust, it''s
    different agents – basically, organizations interacting with each other. All of
    them have people inside. You can go to this personal trust level, but that''s
    not what I did. That''s why I say organizational trust as a term. What I used
    was the “ability, benevolence, and integrity” framework. I called it ABI. Basically,
    there are different layers of trust and there are these more technical trust abilities.
    So in the context of software that''s, “I believe that this software will work.”'
  sec: 1816
  time: '30:16'
  who: Polina
- line: Let's take an example of Microsoft Office, because I think everybody is familiar
    with that a little bit. The technical trust is, “I do know that this software
    allows me to do what I need, like writing or PowerPoint [presentations], or emails
    (or something like that).” Then, in a long-term relationship between two companies
    or, between a company and the person, there are these more relationship-based
    elements – benevolence and integrity. This is where it goes into a more interesting
    (for me) direction. With integrity, it goes more into this, “I know that they
    will be there for me if something goes wrong.” direction. And with benevolence,
    there is this long-term support delivery, basically. Integrity happens after you
    sign the contract, where you don't really know what's going on, but then somebody
    talks to you and they assure you that it's going to go right.
  sec: 1816
  time: '30:16'
  who: Polina
- line: Benevolence is more like the actual support that you see over time. Why it
    was interesting for me is – for the relationship between two companies – before
    that, you could just like... I'm, again, switching more to people, because I think
    it's more understandable with people. Imagine you bought a Microsoft CD – I still
    had CDs when I was in school. Basically, you have this CD forever, and that's
    basically what you know is working. Until you have a completely incompatible system,
    it is going to work. But let's say you buy it now – you buy it now and it works
    for some time. Then you have a question, or there's a feature that you bought
    it because of, and it's not delivered. You open support tickets, and you go to
    the community website, you ask questions, and they maybe don't get answered. So
    there are a whole lot of differences for the relationship in the subscription
    context compared to this, “I have this one CD and nothing goes wrong until the
    system gets so updated [that it doesn't work].”
  sec: 1816
  time: '30:16'
  who: Polina

    no way [to get support]. Or was it not difficult?
  sec: 2036
  time: '33:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, there was definitely a way to get support. But I think it was not
    as prominent in the relationship. With the subscriptions, I think after I started
    researching it, I realized that it's actually kind of growing everywhere – anything
    that has a subscription, you can kind of trust it to go for a long time, but if
    it accidentally breaks or something happens, then you actually will go to the
    company and ask for help. This is why it's just so much more relevant nowadays.

    say I use some product, some internet company, and then they decide to increase
    the price. Then I think “Okay, what are the alternatives that might be cheaper?”
    Then I do research, I find a cheaper alternative and then I switch. Does price
    have anything to do with trust? Or maybe it's a separate thing?
  sec: 2076
  time: '34:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is actually not something that I personally researched, but I think...
    Also looking at just the consumers, again, outside of the companies' relationship.
    Because [with companies] there are contracts, and there is a lot more governing
    this. With regular end users – let's say I have Spotify and they increase the
    price – I think this is definitely a mechanism that goes to this ability, again,
    to kind of the level before trust. This is a place where it's actually also harder
    sometimes to justify the relevance of this relationship, because it can be broken
    because of some other things. Let's say, I use Spotify and then at some point,
    they just don't have the songs that I like anymore. This is, again, this ground
    reason for why use this and not exactly the...
  sec: 2106
  time: '35:06'
  who: Polina
- line: Could it be ability? You expect the software to be able to give you the songs
    you like, but then all of a sudden, they don't have the songs you like. [Polina
    agrees] They kind of violate your trust to be able to provide you with the songs.
  sec: 2167
  time: '36:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think in one of the papers that I read, ability was always the most important
    and the most significant element of trust. Basically, how it goes is – ability
    is mostly consistent over the relationship. You can imagine if Spotify doesn't
    have the songs that I like anymore, then, even if they're a nice provider, even
    if they support me so much, I would probably not continue using the service, (hypothetically
    – they have a lot of songs that I like). [chuckles]
  sec: 2183

  who: Polina

    of expect that the price is a certain number, but then all of a sudden they change
    it. Maybe I misunderstood the framework, but could it be related to integrity
    or is it more like something else?
  sec: 2224
  time: '37:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it always depends on how your relationship was set up. What I mentioned
    before with the contracts – you actually signed a contract and there is an agreement
    between you and the company that there are specific regulations about the price
    change. So it's actually hard to answer this one without knowing what the agreement
    looks like. I'm unfortunately not the expert on contracts in this [inaudible].

    for me to not use the service?” And then when I realize that it's not that much,
    I just skip reading it. But I actually try to be conscious about that, because
    there are many things that can be in the agreement.

- line: And then how is it related to explainable AI? I guess you use this framework
    of organizational trust to somehow create features, maybe, for your model or somehow
    guide your project. [Polina agrees] But then there's another component, which
    is this Explainable AI. How are these two connected?
  sec: 2299
  time: '38:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think this is also maybe one of the arguments, or one of the ways, how I
    turned to research more towards the explainable AI direction. On the one hand,
    I think in social sciences, it's very common that you have the features (or variables
    – however you'd like to call them) and then you try to understand how they are
    connected to the outcome variable, in a way. In industry, it's very often about
    just modeling and being accurate, but not about building a theory and trying to
    show how it works in detail. When I was starting, I was actually overwhelmed a
    little bit by the research on churn that exists. I tried a lot of neural networks
    and was actually disappointed a little bit, because on tabular data, they were
    not exactly performing perfectly (to maybe understate this). They were not performing
    at all.
  sec: 2324
  time: '38:44'
  who: Polina
- line: Then I turned to the more black box models – random forest, XGBoost, some
    of the things that are more classic – and then I started understanding that, actually,
    you have the feature importance, of course, but going into this understanding
    of how the features actually contribute to the outcome and how your model works,
    this is not exactly a standard element of data science (or not a standard element
    of the black box models). What I actually loved is that I realized that sometimes
    the stakeholders can feel the same way, so there was also a demand that the model
    that I'm building should be more than just a score. Because the score doesn't
    really always tell you the story.
  sec: 2324
  time: '38:44'
  who: Polina
- line: So I realized that, on the one hand, it's something that I have, in me, trying
    to explain with a model, but also knowing how it works. But then also, on the
    other hand, that this accuracy-driven (or curve-driven, whatever metric you have
    – because for me, it was the classifications of these two that come into place)
    is sometimes not enough for the end users. That's also what I realized during
    my PhD project. With a social science background, I'm able to communicate and
    this explanation actually helps to communicate models in many ways. This is how
    I ended up researching, in 2019, everything around SHAP values, LIME, and all
    the things that seemed super groundbreaking at that point – and now everybody
    uses those. So I think it was actually very exciting for me to understand the
    entire data science community growing into the direction that feels so natural
    for me. So that was just very, very inspiring, and a very good moment. And then
    of course, that's what I used in the dissertation as well.

- line: 'In practical terms – for you, it was about discovering the connection between...
    Maybe you have different groups of features: features related to ability, features
    related to benevolence, features related to integrity. And then you use tools
    like SHAP values and LIME to determine how exactly these features connect to the
    outcome. Then if a stakeholder asks you, “Hey, why is the score 0.9 for this user?”
    You say “Because, they think that our ability is not really good.” Right? Was
    it something like that?'
  sec: 2514
  time: '41:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think there was also a post on LinkedIn, where I showed a more public
    display of what came out of my PhD. So that's the level where I can stay on this
    public thing. For the end users, I basically show several components of how the
    outcome is modeled, and it's actually very important – and that's also something
    that I learned over the years of trying to explain models – is that sometimes
    it also has to be actionable. So integrity, per se, is, for example, an interesting
    thing to discuss or to research, but telling the end user “integrity is the reason
    for this and that,” is not exactly actionable. They don't know what integrity
    is. They don't have any options to connect with this.
  sec: 2547
  time: '42:27'
  who: Polina
- line: So I also realized that actionability is a very important element during this.
    If you look, for example, at the upcoming, first World xAI Conference (1st World
    Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) coming up in July – I'm very
    excited about going there. There is definitely a group of sessions on actionable
    explainable machine learning, so you can also see that actionability is a very
    prominent trend in the research, currently.

    AI (actionable explainable AI)”? What does it mean?
  sec: 2643
  time: '44:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I'll maybe comment on explainability and interpretability. “Interpretable”
    is basically, for me, more of a technical term, meaning, “My model is logistic
    regression, I can fully see through that.” There was another podcast, I think,
    a couple months ago on DataTalks.Club about explainable machine learning, where
    you mentioned the glass box model – so that's that. And “explainable” is more
    user-facing. Are you able to explain your models?
  sec: 2654
  time: '44:14'
  who: Polina
- line: I have a metaphor for this. Somehow I got obsessed with cats this year with
    cat GIFs and so on. There are many GIFs with cats getting out of boxes and they're
    curious. [chuckles] For me “explainable AI” is all about these curious cats and
    to think about “To whom are you explaining? Who would be jumping out of the box
    to ask you more questions.” So that's kind of the explainability, where interpretability
    is obviously an element, or an attribute, of the model. “Actionable” is more like,
    if you have already mentioned this cat in a box – can the cat do something with
    what you explained? Or is it just a curiosity?
  sec: 2654
  time: '44:14'
  who: Polina
- line: That's “actionable” machine learning. And then we have “interpretable” and
    “explainable”. So they're kind of different characteristics of a model – the same
    model can be interpretable, it can be explainable, and the model can be actionable.
  sec: 2737
  time: '45:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For “actionable,” the way it is used, for example, within the conference
    that I mentioned, it's actionable/explainable. So you not only explain, but you
    also give some insights into what actions the end user can take based on the model.
  sec: 2751
  time: '45:51'
  who: Polina
- line: Which is quite important, right? If our model gives us a churn score of 0.9.
    For us, it's like, “Okay, what do we do now? Does this mean we need to send them
    a promotion to try to keep our users, or we need to do something else?” So this
    is a part of actionability plus explainability?
  sec: 2770
  time: '46:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's also something that's not relevant in all cases. I think explainable
    machine learning, I'm always arguing in favor of that, because it helps you as
    an end user. It also helps you as a data scientist – it has many positive sides
    to it. But actionable, I think, is very often maybe an attribute of actually something
    where the end users want to take action based on that. So maybe it's more thinking
    of decision-making.
  sec: 2792

    of the black box model.

  sec: 2830
  time: '47:10'

    model. And then a glass box model would be logistic regression. Right?

    box?
  sec: 2842
  time: '47:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think maybe I will mention a couple of models that are more complex glass
    box models before that. What I'm mostly excited about in the research now are
    generalized additive models and neural network based models that are basically
    additive. Neural additive models, or neural basis models, are very exciting examples
    of those. I have been, in the past weeks and months, looking at how they compare
    to random forest and SHAP and I think what I don't know yet is, “What is the baseline?”
  sec: 2851
  time: '47:31'
  who: Polina
- line: Because basically, in the end, we have a way a neural network would model
    something and we have a way which random forest with SHAP would model something,
    but what is the ground truth? And very often, we don't know. With random forest
    and SHAP, for example, the SHAP values only try to approximate – they never really
    tell you, “This is 100% how the model works in every situation.” So you still
    don't get this kind of real see-through glass box feeling of it, but it's still
    more than just a black box. So I do see that it's definitely not a glass box model,
    but maybe like...

  sec: 2938
  time: '48:58'

    exactly 100% that the model itself that gives you the outcome, for the interpretability.
  sec: 2940
  time: '49:00'
  who: Polina

    regression model?
  sec: 2954
  time: '49:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, yeah. Yes, I think there are different ways to put it. Basically,
    I think every person in the field maybe has a slightly different definition of
    interpretability. I think that's...
  sec: 2960
  time: '49:20'
  who: Polina

  sec: 2977

  who: Polina

  sec: 2980
  time: '49:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think with a random forest, I think you could actually go into all
    of the trees and learn it all. But sometimes your brain just doesn't have the
    capacity to do that. So that's where interpretability breaks, I think. There's
    also a trick with explainability – there's recent research that I mentioned, that
    I like a lot –  with explainability, you would say, “I have a random forest forest
    and SHAP, and for each feature, I know what the contribution to the outcome is,
    so that's explainable.” But in fact, when you add a person to this, sometimes
    it's completely not explainable, because maybe your features are named in a way
    that nobody can read. Or maybe they are just so not understandable that no human
    can know what this means. I think this is more commonly applied to computer vision
    or text where it's like, “This pixel is gray, so this is why it's a cat.” This
    is not exactly explainable in terms of how we would put it for humans.
  sec: 2982
  time: '49:42'
  who: Polina
- line: But then for neural networks, I think, there are these techniques that show
    activation regions. They show something where you have a picture and it highlights
    the area around the ears, highlights the area around the nose – around the areas
    of the picture that shows that, “This is a cat. These are the areas where the
    neural network is activated. That's why we think this is a cat.”[Polina agrees]
    And this would be an example of explainable machine learning, right? An explainable
    model.
  sec: 3047
  time: '50:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Very often... I'm not an expert in computer vision, I'm more of a tabular
    data person. But for me, when these kinds of activation maps are displayed, this
    is definitely an element that makes it explainable because, of course, there is
    much more in the background that is calculated to just display that. But this
    display helps to communicate it to humans.
  sec: 3080
  time: '51:20'
  who: Polina
- line: I just want to summarize what you said, to make sure I understood. So an interpretable
    machine learning model should be a glass box model – it should be something like
    logistic regression, linear regression, generalized additive mode – the sort of
    model where you can look at the coefficients that the model learned, and then
    you can kind of make sense of this. And then an explainable ML model can be a
    black box model, but there could be a method that helps us understand the output
    and then we can explain why there was a certain prediction made. Then an actionable
    ML model would be a model where there is a score and we know what to do – what
    kind of action, what kind of decision to make – based on the score. Right?

  sec: 3157

  who: Polina

    ML model necessarily explainable as well? Does it follow from being interpretable
    that the model is also explainable?”
  sec: 3159
  time: '52:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it does not. If you're interested, there is a very nice paper – maybe
    we can link it in the notes for the episode later on. There is a paper about explainable
    feature spaces – it's from a research group at MIT – and they are looking into
    different... Basically different “curious cats,” if you put it in my words – “to
    whom do you explain your model?” It actually has a very nice visualization of
    how different explanations may matter for different groups. If you're talking
    to data scientists, for them, an interpretable model is probably explainable,
    because your end user cares about individual features and they know what the features
    are, and they are also very technically skilled to actually also understand everything
    that the coefficients mean.
  sec: 3177
  time: '52:57'
  who: Polina
- line: If you're looking more in the area of ethics, for example, you have very different
    backgrounds there. For some people, they actually want very different explanations
    for your model than this kind of strictly technical outcome of the interpretable
    model. Even if it's logistic regression, you can get very confusing features in
    and therefore very confusing outcomes. Then the closer to the end users, or to
    decision-makers, you get, the more explainable your feature space must be. So
    it's not enough to just label your features “1, 2, 3, 4, 5” and then put it to
    a decision maker and tell them “Well, five is one, therefore, it's 0.9.” This
    is technically interpretable – not at all explainable and not at all understandable.
  sec: 3177

    trust, not the one we talked about (organizational trust) but maybe it is. You

    can bring trust among customers or different stakeholders?”
  sec: 3323
  time: '55:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so this is a research direction that's very common now, I think – also
    in computational social science, in AI research – that focuses on how people interact
    with machine learning. It's not the trust that I focused on. In the neural basis
    model and the sparse polynomial additive model, they actually test how comfortable
    the end users feel when they see the explanations. I think that's something that
    is getting more and more prominent now. You also see it in the SHAP papers, that
    people test, “Can people really understand it?” Researchers want to know, “Does
    it really get nice feedback from the humans interpreting the models?” I think
    explainability also really helps to maybe demystify this machine learning phenomenon
    a little bit, where people might think that it's just like, “Press a button and
    then you have something and you will never know because the machine is smarter
    than you.”
  sec: 3338
  time: '55:38'
  who: Polina
- line: I think the machine is not smarter than you and, very often, humans and end
    users have information that the machine doesn't have. So it's actually helping
    to build trust, in my opinion. But also what it helps to build is this power of
    people knowing what the machine learned, and then adding something on top of this
    to get the best outcome. It's very interesting because for large language models,
    for example – also, I'm not an expert – but for large language models now there
    is an increasing demand of “Where does the information come from? Is it something
    that model learned? Can you point to a document where this comes from?” So it
    gives you a more grounded interaction between the model and the end user.
  sec: 3338

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. With tabular data and simpler black box models, they do not hallucinate
    in this way. [chuckles] But with large language models, it just gets more prominent

- line: I was thinking, when you were describing that, “Okay, we have ability, benevolence,
    integrity, and then we also have this framework from interpretable, explainable
    machine learning.” So we can kind of link all the predictions because we understand
    that, “Okay, these features are related to ability and we see that more and more
    users churn because of that.” It would make a great metric that people from top
    management would really understand. Do you see this happening in practice?

- line: I think what I must say here is that trust is incredibly difficult to measure.
    What you have is basically a lot of proxy variables – a lot of variables Alexey,
    as you said, associated with (related to) trust, but you can never say that something
    100% captures that. Because it's so hard to catch, [chuckles] I think it's impossible
    to make it a KPI because... You can have measurement errors – you never know what's
    really happening between the people.

- line: Because organizations, as I said, are actually people, so there are a lot
    of things that you would not want to track. There's also compliance, GDPR – a
    lot of laws and it's just not ethical to track this on a level where we would
    try to observe it. So I think, overall, I would say it's impossible to really
    make it a very well-measured KPI, and when it's not well-measured, then it probably
    shouldn't be KPI. That's my point on that.

- line: Are there good proxies that will at least give you some indication that, “Okay,
    we're losing customers because our integrity is not good?

  who: Alexey
- line: I think this will very much depend on the company. Each company has very different
    perspectives on who the customers are. I talked about Microsoft Office customers
    and Spotify customers – of course, you cannot measure it in the same way, for
    example, for these two products. So it's very different. One of the learnings
    from my PhD was that there is also a lot of research in marketing and relationship
    – studies between companies that show that it's important to show that, yes, it
    is in fact true – there is a role that trust plays in the relationship. But I
    think it's so hard to measure and it's so specific that...

- line: I like that it is a research project for me, but maybe not exactly a good
    KPI for companies. Then we also talked about the fact that ability to making a
    great product is actually more important than... I think we have the response
    or the answer to that. Building great products would be a priority anyway.

- line: I guess it's a good idea for another research project, right? Because I can
    imagine that this could be useful, or at least I think that now. Who knows what
    the reality is? But I can imagine that, for executives, it could be useful to
    see, “Okay, we're losing customers because of that thing. Let's see how we can
    improve that thing.” But as you said, if you focus on ability, maybe the other
    things will fall into place.

- line: Yeah. I think there are many people researching churn in many different ways.
    There are a lot of ways of how to look at that.

    us today, for sharing your experience with us, for telling us about your experience
    doing a PhD, and your work. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today too, and
    watching us, asking questions. Have a great week, everyone!
