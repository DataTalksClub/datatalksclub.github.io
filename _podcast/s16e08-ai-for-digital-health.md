transcript:
- header: Podcast Introduction
- line: This week, we will talk about AI for digital healthcare. We have a special
    guest today, Maria. Maria is the founder and the CEO of SQIN. She is a podcast
    host, and she was named one of the top 20 Women in AI. Welcome to the show, Maria.

  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, thank you so much for having me.
  sec: 25
  time: 0:25
  who: Maria
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared, as always, by Johanna Bayer.
    Thanks, Johanna, for your help. Actually, Johanna tried the app that we'll talk
    about today. She liked SQIN H that the app reported. [Maria chuckles] So yeah
    – thanks, again, Johanna. Usually, we start the interview…

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Journey: From Electrical Engineering to Founding SQIN'
- line: Before going to the main topic, we start the interview by talking about your
    career progression. So let's start with your background. Can you tell us about
    your career journey so far?
  sec: 49
  time: 0:49
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. I studied electrical engineering in China, so I was always very
    close to the technology side of things. And then I started to work for Siemens
    – I did the transformation strategy for the managing board for mobility and electrical
    things (all their energy stuff) which was quite interesting. But I always felt
    like, “Okay, I want to do something, and to do a strategy for something and then
    do it.” So if there is a mistake or a wrong decision, I'm the one who has to deal
    with that.
  sec: 59
  time: 0:59
  who: Maria
- line: Then I got pregnant, and during this pregnancy, I decided, “Okay, now it's
    the time to change everything because my life is changing either way.” That was
    the moment I decided, “Okay, let's found something. Let's transform an industry
    that really needs to be shaped.” That was healthcare. So we started the idea of
    SQIN with an MVP, and then different financial rounds. And yeah, here we are today!
  sec: 59
  time: 0:59
  who: Maria
- line: How old is your kid?
  sec: 115
  time: '1:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: My little one is turning five now.
  sec: 117
  time: '1:57'
  who: Maria
- line: Five. So, you went into that five years ago, right?
  sec: 121
  time: '2:01'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Founder Approach: Industry Immersion, MVP Development'
- line: Yeah. We started five years ago with the first ideas and our MVP. But we always,
    as founders, believe that… For us, we didn't have the idea and then we woke up
    in the morning and said, “This is exactly what we want to do.” It was more that
    we understood, “Okay, there is an area in industry that needs help from the technology
    perspective.” In healthcare, you see limited resources, a lot of issues, a lot
    of people around the world dealing with so many, many things. Infrastructure is
    not that good. So we always believed, “Okay, we have to understand the industry
    first, and then we can come up with a solution.”
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Maria
- line: At these times, we didn't even talk about AI, honestly. It was more like,
    “Okay, let's create technologies that can help here.” So that's why we started
    in the first one and a half-two years, more or less, with discussing and getting
    to know all these different players – we have the regulation, we have the pharmacists,
    the doctors, the patients, the hospitals, the pharma companies with medication,
    and so on. So there are very, very different players in this area, and if you
    want to come up with a technology or solution, you have to deal with all of them
    – at least most of them. You have to understand them. Therefore, we have an atypical
    founders’ journey, I would say. We really spent a lot of time on this MVP status
    quo, or bootstrap, to really know what we have to come up with.
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Maria
- line: Is your co-founder also a mom – somebody on maternity leave?
  sec: 215
  time: '3:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, no – my co-founder is a man. [chuckles] He’s the experienced one from
    the two of us? I would say he spent more than seven years in the valley, discovering
    different startup journeys and different companies. We met at university very
    much earlier and then just decided… [cross-talk]
  sec: 223
  time: '3:43'
  who: Maria
- line: In China, right?
  sec: 245
  time: '4:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we then decided to go on that journey together.
  sec: 246
  time: '4:06'
  who: Maria
- header: 'Why Healthcare: Digitization Opportunity in Medical Systems'
- line: Oh, so you already knew your co-founder way before starting. Then you got
    pregnant and thought, “Okay, your life is going to change anyway. Let's start
    something.” So you talked with the co-founder, and then you decided to go into
    the healthcare industry. Right?
  sec: 250
  time: '4:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For me, that was a very interesting thing. After university, a group
    of all my friends – most of them are entrepreneurs now, so most of them started
    businesses pretty early. We just sat down together, and I said, “Okay, I feel
    like I'm ready to also do something,” and then discussions came up. So it was
    not always just the two of us, but at the end of the day, when we knew, “Okay,
    this is what we will come up with.” Then there was a decision, “Okay, it makes
    sense. Let’s start this journey together as a team.”
  sec: 271
  time: '4:31'
  who: Maria
- line: That’s quite interesting. Why healthcare?
  sec: 303
  time: '5:03'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Healthcare Challenges: Data Gaps, Rural Access, and Legacy Workflows'
- line: I think, five years ago, healthcare was an industry that was not really digitized.
    They just started to think about, “Okay, what could be different in the future?”
    There was not even data. People, at least in Germany, started to talk about the
    data gaps we have, and the lack of information as well. For example, medications
    were just tested with male people – not even all of them were women. So there
    was a huge change that you could feel in the way people thought about health care.
  sec: 307
  time: '5:07'
  who: Maria
- line: Rural areas, for example, started to say, “Well, we have an issue with resources
    because in a lot of doctors’ offices, the doctors are turning older and older,
    and we don't get new doctors here in our area.” So it was a time where you could
    feel that there will be a change in the system and that it was time to do that
    in a sustainable way. It was not because one of us studied in that field or something.
    It was really more about the potential analyzes of different industries.
  sec: 307
  time: '5:07'
  who: Maria
- header: 'Legacy Infrastructure: Fax, Fragmentation, and Slow Adoption'
- line: In Germany… I live in Berlin, and the doctors still communicate with each
    other using fax. I go do an MRI, and then they do the analysis of the MRI, and
    send the results by fax to my doctor. It prints and everything. It's 2023 and
    we're still using faxes.
  sec: 371
  time: '6:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah! I mean, look at the papers for the pharmacies that are still printed
    out. Of course, we all talk about electronic prescriptions, but where is it in
    real life? So it's still something we are working on, even if we digitize in very
    different areas, but healthcare, due to the regulations and the sensitivity of
    data, is always two or three steps behind. I’m sure that you’ve noticed how a
    lot of startup innovations are coming up in the last few years. But most of them,
    from my perspective, were too innovative because, of course, healthcare is one
    of the oldest industries and you cannot change the whole ship with just one wave.
    Right?
  sec: 397
  time: '6:37'
  who: Maria
- line: You have to keep the people on board, you have to understand the whole system
    (the ecosystem) and then you need to try to design something that keeps what we
    have, but it's still going into the future. I think this is the main challenge
    in healthcare. The second thing is that every area works differently. Not just
    every country, but also the cities, or the areas (like the rural areas). You need
    to see what you have. In the area where I come from, we don't even have dermatologists
    or doctors for eyes or something – you have to go to the next big cities to find
    some. So there are a lot of specifics, and you have to understand them before
    creating a solution in healthcare.
  sec: 397
  time: '6:37'
  who: Maria
- line: Which area are you from?
  sec: 491
  time: '8:11'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Regional Perspective: Access Issues in Southern Brandenburg'
- line: I'm from Southern Brandenburg. So from Berlin, just going to the south. I
    mean, my parents are still living there. The situation’s not that easy. My mom's
    always going to Berlin to see a doctor. It's about a two-hour ride. I mean, we're
    talking about Germany, so we can imagine how other areas have issues.
  sec: 493
  time: '8:13'
  who: Maria
- line: From Berlin, in two hours, I can be in Rostock or Dresden.
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, true. [chuckles]
  sec: 521
  time: '8:41'
  who: Maria
- line: It's a lot of time, two hours, if we think about that. Also, in big cities,
    it’s sometimes very difficult to book an appointment because all the doctors are
    booked in advance.
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, definitely. That's why we always thought that we should not start with
    the idea and think “Okay, how can technology be used to do the services doctors
    do?” We should think more about how to make them more efficient or to make the
    whole system more progressive and more adaptable to new situations and the load
    of people.” Instead of saying, “Okay, we need to change something.” Because there
    are a lot of good things. They are quite good, educated doctors here, so why not
    support them first? Why not get them on board to come into a new chapter, a new
    era of healthcare?
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Maria
- line: So you realized that there is a problem, “This is definitely an area where
    there's a lot of potential for digitalization.” Then, because you come from the
    south of Brandenburg, and your parents are still there, you see the state of health
    care there. We also talked about the state of health care in big cities like Berlin,
    where it's also not the best.
  sec: 577
  time: '9:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. What is very important to understand is that while I studied in China,
    I also lived for a while in Brazil. So I know other healthcare systems as well.
    Honestly, they're working pretty much differently and sometimes much more connected.
    I will always remember when I was invited to a conference in Stockholm (I would
    say, three and a half, four years ago) and they already came up with these kinds
    of good connections, data sources. They already thought about how it can be done
    because the country is wide, so people are definitely in different areas. I mean,
    there's so much going on around the world that, as a founder, I think one of the
    most important things is become aware of the things that are going on and not
    just be stuck in your own in industry, or country, or bubble (like the LinkedIn
    bubbles, where we always see these great success stories) but to keep yourself
    open to other perspectives and try to understand what is going on.
  sec: 603
  time: '10:03'
  who: Maria
- line: You can see me – I'm currently in Jakarta, and before, I was in Singapore.
    Honestly, I've had moments like, “That was so crazy!” Just a quick example – we
    always talk about how robots could probably change our life or make our processes
    more efficient. But I was in Starbucks getting coffee, and one of the robots just
    came to me and was asking me, “Okay, do you have something I can put in the rubbish?”
    So it's very much normal already there. The things we are afraid of, are still
    talking about, are still conceptualizing – they already exist in other places
    of the world. So bring yourself to the hotspots of your industries and try to
    understand, “What could be the next level? What is the next step?” Or probably.
    “What could you learn out of that?” I mean, my little one was with me, so for
    him, it was quite normal to see these things. But back home, it's still a huge
    discussion.
  sec: 603
  time: '10:03'
  who: Maria
- line: So what I got from this is, while you were in Jakarta, there were already
    robots helping people, while in the south of Brandenburg, there were no doctors.
    Right?
  sec: 721
  time: '12:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Kind of. Yeah, you could say that. Yes. [chuckles] At least from
    my perspective.'
  sec: 734
  time: '12:14'
  who: Maria
- header: 'Market Research Tactics: Cold Outreach, Accelerators, Clinical Meetings'
- line: Yeah. [chuckles] Some five years ago, you realized that there is a gap and,
    together with your co founder, who you already met before, you started learning
    more about the industry. From my understanding, you didn't know much about this
    industry. You just saw that there was a problem and that there was potential,
    but you still needed to get time to learn about the key players – pharmacies,
    hospitals, the patients, regulations, etc. So how did you approach that? What
    did you do in these two and a half years?
  sec: 740
  time: '12:20'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'AR MVP: Lipstick Try-On as a Data Collection & Engagement Tool'
- line: I would say we started very rough. We reached out to people or brands, or
    hospitals, or whatever institutions – you want to know more about most of them.
    Of course, you can start with Google and you could start educating yourself, but
    we really did it in a cold way. We just called them or left messages like, “Hey,
    we're currently analyzing the industry.” We got some things out of that. If you
    really try, you will always meet these innovative or early adopters outside that
    are really open-minded and let you come in and give you some good advice.
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Maria
- line: I remember we had several different meetings, in hospitals, we went with the
    doctors, we tried to understand the process that they are really going through
    – not just what you see as a patient, but what are they doing in the backend and
    in their systems. Of course, our jobs in previous companies helped us – we were
    “business proven” that we are not just someone, but that we really wanted to do
    something. Also, we used a lot of accelerator programs to understand the markets
    better and to understand the players better, especially about regulations – because
    lawyers and so on are a huge investment for a very early idea. So accelerated
    programs really helped us a lot. Then, we found two or three big players that
    said, “Yeah, data (or AI, or technology) is definitely one of the future things.
    Why don’t you create a prototype first?” So we started in the AR area together
    with two or three brands.
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Maria
- line: First, we created an AR filter, and just did a quick MVP to collect some data.
    We came to a fair with these things. It was a lipstick try-on – very rough, but
    very innovative at that time. We were so proud because that was one of the first
    try-on on Instagram that was ever published. We just had a lot of people using
    it on Instagram, but also at the fair. So we collected tons of data. But at that
    time, we didn't even know what it was worth, nor what we could learn from it.
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Maria
- line: Then we took the second half of the time to make these things first, understandable,
    “Okay, what kind of data do we have now? What can we learn from it?” And then
    we discussed that back with the partners to see, “Okay, what does it say for possible
    solutions?” At that point, we stopped doing AR for a reason, because this is what
    we learned out of it. But it was a perfect, very easy entry for us – a gamification
    entry to collect first data and first users at the beginning.
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Maria
- line: Maybe this is a stupid question, but how is a lipstick try-on app connected
    to healthcare?
  sec: 939
  time: '15:39'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Discovery: Skin Health Signals Hidden in Lifestyle Interactions'
- line: Yeah. What you do when you try on lipstick is a sequence – it could be a picture
    or video of your whole face. So what we got out of that was not really about...
    We, of course, saw how lipstick fits you in terms of color, but we also saw the
    issues on the skin. We recognized, for example, that 80% of people didn't know
    their type of skin at this time. So that was a huge educational moment. We also
    understood, for example, the health issues people have on their skin that we can
    recognize. So things were already changing early in this short sequence. We saw,
    “Okay, it's nice to know which color of lipstick fits you. But honestly, what
    we see is much more about the status quo of your health from your skin.”
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Maria
- line: That was the moment we realized, “Okay, there's much more we can do with the
    data.” Of course, we didn't have the algorithms then to do anything but that was
    so much that we got out of it. There was so much more to explore and this was
    definitely a more interesting market than focusing on just lipstick or makeup.
    But it was a perfect entry point to get connected to people and users. Because
    I think you can have a very good technology but if people don't have fun using
    it, or don't see a benefit in using it, why should they do so? When you tell people,
    “Let's do a health check,” for most people it's like, “Ugh, I don't like it. I
    don't even like to go to a doctor. I don't want to talk about that.” But every
    woman… [cross-talk]
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Maria
- line: But if you just use your phone to do the health check, that's a different
    thing.
  sec: 1053
  time: '17:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Also, from the marketing perspective, it's much easier to get people
    on board saying, “Hey, do you want to try out your next nice lipstick color?”
    For example, or, “The next eyebrow trend?” People, and especially women, think,
    “Oh, that's nice. Before I buy it, I can try it.” But meanwhile, you can do so
    many more things and educate people about so much. That's why we thought, “Okay,
    that was the second really big learning out of that.” The first was, “There's
    much more we can explore. There's much more we can do from the technology perspective.”
    And the second thing was, “It was a very good entry, because people are very much
    likely to discuss makeup and these kinds of lifestyle things.” Yeah, it was a
    very interesting time and that was our starting point.
  sec: 1057
  time: '17:37'
  who: Maria
- header: 'Founder Lessons: Experimentation, Pivoting, and Plan B Flexibility'
- line: I'm just curious. For me, I see the connection – you take a picture, or probably
    a stream of data, like a video, you try the lipstick and, at the same time, you
    recognize that there are some skin problems on the face. Right? [Maria agrees]
    How did you know that this is what you needed to do before you did the lipstick
    app? Because you wanted to do the healthcare thing, yet you created a lipstick
    app. Then, with the lipstick app, you collected a lot of data and then you started
    [the healthcare part]. Did you do this on purpose because you knew that while
    you try on lipstick, you see other areas of the face?
  sec: 1107
  time: '18:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely not. I mean, that was what we learned out of that. As founder,
    you probably also know that – you have a plan, but most of the time, you have
    to go to Plan B or Plan C. When we started having discussions with all these players
    of the market, we were lucky enough to find some that said “Okay, here's a budget
    for you to do something,” or, “Here are the resources we could provide,” or, “We
    could do the marketing campaign together, if you do this and that.” So it was
    a little bit of an opportunity to decide, “Okay, let's give it a try.” I mean,
    at least there are no investors or no one saying or forcing us to do specifically
    these things or those things. It was really more about learning about the market,
    technologies, etc.
  sec: 1149
  time: '19:09'
  who: Maria
- line: Also, AR was, at that time, a very new, very hard thing, so it was a lot of
    fun getting to know all these developers and AR haps and all these experts to
    see what is possible already. Imagine, now we are using filters on Instagram and
    TikTok every single day, but at this time, it was really, really new. For us,
    it was like an opportunity – we went on a path, and we were lucky that at the
    end of the path, we came back to the initial idea. This is what I always say to
    other founders I meet, “Of course, you have a plan, but you cannot always get
    stuck on a plan. You have to also be kind of flexible.” Because who knows if plan
    A is going to work? Yeah – follow the path.
  sec: 1149
  time: '19:09'
  who: Maria
- line: For you, it was an opportunity to experiment with AI technologies – VR (virtual
    reality/augmented reality) and with these sorts of things. You could experiment
    and you had some sort of budget to do that, so you thought, “Okay, let's just
    do a lipstick app.” Then with that… Because I immediately see how it can generate
    attention. Even with these stupid apps – I remember one where you take a picture,
    so you have a selfie of yourself and then it shows how you would look 30 years
    from now. Or you take a picture of two people and then it shows what your baby
    would look like. [chuckles] I mean, it’s kind of stupid, right?
  sec: 1242
  time: '20:42'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Product-Market Fit: Aligning AI Capabilities with Business Cases'
- line: Yeah. All these kinds of things have been coming up over the last few years.
    But, as mentioned, we started with the lipstick thing – nothing was there. That
    was so crazy. When we published the thing and had it at the fair, I really remember
    that most people said, “I’ve never done something like that before.” That was
    also an amazing drive for us from a mental perspective. People really gave us
    the feeling that, “This is new, this is hard, this is fun. Let's continue this
    way.” It was like we came from one point to the next one. There were definitely
    a lot of things. You could see it – most of these features or apps were not really
    focused on a business case at the time. But from a technology perspective – and
    it's the same thing you can see with AI now – there are so many different things
    going on.
  sec: 1292
  time: '21:32'
  who: Maria
- line: Everybody says “Here’s an algorithm. My algorithm is better.” But it's not
    just about technology, you also need a use case or a business case at the end
    of the day, One that makes money and makes sense for the society of our environment.
    I would say, with technology, always go first – you can explore what is possible,
    but then you need to find the right case for the company. That's exactly what
    we have done. We tried different things with AR, with AI – whatever, all these
    kinds of technologies – and then finally, we came up with a product or a technology
    that really makes a lot of sense now. Very early in the process, after already
    founding the company, we were then profitable. That was kind of unusual for startups
    in that phase. But we took the time before to really explore and understand what
    we had to do.
  sec: 1292
  time: '21:32'
  who: Maria
- line: So the lipstick app was making money.
  sec: 1391
  time: '23:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, but the lipstick app… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1394
  time: '23:14'
  who: Maria
- line: There was something else, right?
  sec: 1396
  time: '23:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. As I said at the beginning, the lipstick was more like an MVP. After
    that, we understood what to do, and then we established the company. After establishing
    [the company], with the new idea (or the renewed idea), pretty much after launching
    the technology, we were able to make the whole thing profitable.
  sec: 1399
  time: '23:19'
  who: Maria
- header: 'SQIN Product: Digital Clinic Flow from Diagnosis to Prescription'
- line: Can you maybe tell us more about… Okay, you did the app, you collected a lot
    of data, you realized that there's a lot of people that have skin problems without
    even knowing about it, so you saw that there was an opportunity. Then, after you
    realized – what happened after that? How did you go from that point, to the point

- line: After that, we worked on two different areas. The first was, of course, the
    technology – how to really prove that you see things that are different on your
    skin now, and how to prove that this might be a disease and that you’re having
    issues with your health. That was the first area. We sat down together with a
    lot of doctors. Telemedicine was just invented at this time – it just started.
    There are three parts. The first was really the AI itself – how to see from a
    picture that there are diseases. The second one was creating an application or
    a flow that makes sense, so that the user could benefit from the technology. Because
    just knowing that you probably have acne doesn't give you anything. You need a
    real environment, and this is when we came up with our app, SQIN, which is a digital
    clinic. You can get everything from diagnosis, to consultation, to treatment.
    We also have pharmacies there, so you get a prescription.
  sec: 1448
  time: '24:08'
  who: Maria
- line: Everything is digital – in one flow. This is really where users benefit. It’s
    not just giving them information, but also giving them a treatment, and an ecosystem
    where they can grow themselves. That was part one and two. One very important
    part, for me specifically, was the ethics and communication of our solution. Because
    if I tell you from the first moment, “Hey, I think you have skin cancer,” you
    will close the app and say, “What was that? I don't want to hear that.” It's a
    very sensitive field, so you have to, of course, not just keep in mind the regulations,
    (they're very strong, also) but you also have to think about what you are talking
    about. I feel a lot of responsibility dealing with this information. We put in
    a lot of effort and onboarded communication experts [to establish] how to communicate
    that to people via an application. It’s very short – I mean, you just have three
    or four seconds before people lose their interest in the information, but also
    not dropping it too hard.
  sec: 1448
  time: '24:08'
  who: Maria
- line: 'So this is a balance you have to find – how to make good use of communication.
    Then, of course, there’s also the ethical part. If we''re talking about healthcare,
    it''s crystal clear that you have to create a solution that fits everyone. This
    means that no matter where you are, what time, which color of skin, or ethnic
    group, or country of origin, (like, you want to name it). Also, there are people
    who may not be able to see or to hear or to whatever – there are so many different
    kinds of people – and healthcare is there for everyone. I think this is the main
    challenge: creating a solution that is inclusive, and an AI that is capable of
    dealing with all the types of people around the world. That was also a very strong
    concept on the part of our business – how to achieve that. Or, at least, once
    you know your limitations, how to create something that will still benefit people
    or so that people still get a response. That was a huge, huge concept for us.'

    market, but more like… European. Then, we decided to integrate a kind of plan
    B, so if there was something else detected, the algorithm has to say “Okay, here
    are my limitations,” or, “I need further information. So you can do other things
    – other experiences. We just thought about fallbacks. I think that's the most
    important thing. Not just saying, “Okay, you are out – you cannot use the app,”
    but you can find other ways or you can recommend other things. Of course, we had
    the idea of being inclusive, but with the core technology, we definitely had to
    focus on a specific market. As you probably know, if you want to create a good
    AI, you need the data to train as well. It was nearly impossible at that time
    to have all the data for all the different ethnic groups, for example. I mean,
    there was no money, no resources – nothing – so we had to [have a] focus, of course.
    But this doesn't mean that you cannot find solutions for all the other possibilities.

    to start collecting the data from scratch for this project. Right?

- header: 'Data Strategy: Leveraging Community Reach to Bootstrap Datasets'

    the lipstick app, of course, we created a community. You can introduce different
    things to communities. Therefore, of course, we could have started from zero –
    we could not use what we have done, but we could use the I would say the reach,
    or the community, we created to then get started pretty easily (or at least not
    from zero).
  sec: 1783
  time: '29:43'
  who: Maria
- line: Yeah, that's… I keep hearing about the importance of community. Sometimes
    it's clear why. Here, it's a super good illustration of why it's important. These
    two apps are somewhat connected, but the community is the same, so people want
    to help you. It's the same users (some of them) – there’s an intersection.
  sec: 1813
  time: '30:13'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Community Productization: Daily Lifestyle Integration & Retention'
- line: Yeah, that's why I said that sometimes it's also important to go on paths
    that you don't think about in the first moment. Of course, if you have a health
    application, you don't have to go to the doctor every single day, and your skin
    is not changing every single day, and your skin diseases are not there every single
    day, or you don’t have upcoming new ones every single day, but – especially women
    (not just women, but especially women) are dealing with makeup, skincare, and
    haircare every single day. Still, they are doing something every single day. That
    was exactly what we thought with the community. This is the border between both
    things we have done.
  sec: 1844
  time: '30:44'
  who: Maria
- line: Your skin health is not just related to diseases, it's also about how you
    treat your skin. Why not combine a lifestyle issue that people are really doing
    on a daily basis with a health checkup? That is what you see now in our application.
    You have much more things to do than just talking to a doctor. We believe that
    you have to interact with your community on a daily basis. It's not just specifically
    in one doctor's case, what you could do. So community is definitely important
    and we are working quite a lot with our community. We develop features with them,
    we ask them for feedback, we try to see (through their behavior) what they like
    and what they don't like. Of course, you can improve the whole company and the
    whole concept of your application moves over time. Just because you have good
    technology, you cannot stop developing. You have to think about tomorrow and the
    days after already. It's very impressive what you can learn out of your users
    and your communities.

- header: 'Audience Expansion: Reaching Multiple Genders and Demographics'
- line: It's for both genders. For women (for me) it's sometimes easier to give an
    example [chuckles] because I'm doing it in the same way. For men, it was very
    interesting. Very soon we had more male users than female because, I think, the
    point is that they hate going to doctors – most of them. They don't want to know
    other people seeing them going there, they want to do it more privately, so applications
    like ours are very much for them. You would not imagine – men really care about
    their hair, the beard and, also, they don't want to age and get all these wrinkles
    and stuff. It’s a very male dominant topic. It's the same thing here – you can
    achieve both target groups, but you have to think about the content, which, again,
    comes from the community. So just try to understand what they are interested in.
  sec: 1960
  time: '32:40'
  who: Maria
- line: One of the reasons I asked about that is because I imagine that the lipstick
    app – the community you built around that was woman-dominant, because men typically
    don't try lipstick on themselves (most of them). But yet, the new community (the
    new users) are both genders, right? [Maria agrees] So you somehow needed to acquire
    more male users.
  sec: 2015
  time: '33:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, healthcare is a topic for everyone, so everyone is here. And
    lipstick – let's say makeup in general – was more for a specific type of group.
    It helped to have the early adopters and the first users going with us, but very
    soon, this group also definitely understood, “Okay, now there's a benefit for
    my partner, my brother, and my dad as well.” So it was more like a rolling effect
    here – like a snowball. One came to the other and soon, we had more male users
    than female when we launched the healthcare part.
  sec: 2041
  time: '34:01'
  who: Maria
- line: Also, to your point of men not liking going to doctors – I, myself, sometimes
    go to a dermatologist. In Berlin, it's not really possible to find a dermatologist
    that is covered by public insurance. You have to pay. [Maria agrees] And not only
    do you have to pay, but you also have to wait for the appointment – three months
    or four. So it's not just [that you don’t like it], it's difficult to go there.
    Then you wait for four months… Okay, in four months, your skin will probably change.
  sec: 2082
  time: '34:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, I wanted to go to a dermatologist – in May, I booked an appointment
    for the end of August. Then there’s the sun, all this stuff, and the problem I
    had before no longer existed. So I go there and they say, “Okay, you have spots
    on your face.” “Okay, thanks. I waited for that for four months. Thanks.” [chuckles]
    And they’re like, “Okay, give me 100 euros now.” [chuckles] With the app, I imagine
    that you can just not wait for four months – that's already an advantage. You
    don't need to go anywhere, you don't need to pay 100 euros (hopefully [chuckles]).
    I can only see benefits. Right?
  sec: 2082
  time: '34:42'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Telemedicine Impact: Remote Follow-Up, Prescriptions, and Efficiency'
- line: What you mentioned is the core benefit already, but it's a little bit more
    than that as well. As mentioned, you can get the prescription directly – you have
    the online pharmacies. Also, if you need medication, it's directly coming to your
    home, if you like it to. Of course, you don't have to [have it delivered], but
    if you'd like to. The second thing is – very often doctors say, “Okay, here's
    the medication. It would be very nice if you come back in two months so we can
    see if it's working or not.” In the application, both the doctor and patient have
    the chance to see the development of the skin. So you don't have to go there [again],
    you don't have to wait for your next appointment. If there is a huge thing going
    on, you can directly ping the doctor again. So the whole process is improved.
    It's not just a moment [of your life] – we can cover the whole story. Also, if
    there was something heavy going on, if the algorithm or the doctor sees that,
    of course, we will say “Let's go to the doctor. Let's see him in person.”
  sec: 2157
  time: '35:57'
  who: Maria
- line: Sometimes it's necessary, and that's fine. But if a doctor is able to put
    some of his patients into an online solution, he has more space in the office
    to see the people who really need him. Especially for dermatologists – more than
    80% of patients are… I don't know the English word for it, but in German, it's
    called, “I see you and know within 10 seconds what you have.” But they have to
    spend some time on the people, of course, which is a good thing from the social
    perspective side. But from an efficiency perspective, that could have been much
    faster. Digital solutions – not just our app, but most of the telemedicine things
    – that's a huge, huge thing that saves time, so the doctor can treat more people.
    Therefore, we can really change how long you have to wait and how the whole process
    is done.

  sec: 2322

    who can communicate – experts in communication. If I open an app, take a selfie

- header: 'Personalization: Archetypes, Gamification, and Educational Content'

    different groups of people communicate differently. Therefore, you also have to
    give me information in a different way, and then I have to give the information
    to you in order to give you a call to action. That was the first thing. Without
    knowing a person, how can you measure very easily how to communicate with them?
    That was the first part. The second one is then, of course, giving you some benefit.
    But it cannot be more than one or two sentences. So I probably have to not just
    say, “This is acne,” but I have to tell you, “Oh, here's a cream that perfectly
    helps you with dealing with your acne.” So it's the same information… [cross-talk]
  sec: 2370

  time: '40:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, definitely. And not just the type of skin. There are also other parameters
    like hydration, for example, wrinkles, pores, all these kinds of things. We started
    doing a kind of gamification element to give you the information and some education
    to make you understand the information. Because honestly, I have dry skin, you
    have oily skin, for example – what does this mean? This doesn't change my life.
    Right? If I don't know what it means, I will not change anything. So I need to
    tell you, “Okay, you have dry skin. For you, it is very important to act like
    this, this, this – or do this, this, and that.” That was the first part. Gamification,
    education, and, in the end, benefits. It's all about benefits. People perform
    actions because they want to benefit from it. So you have to be crystal clear
    about what you are offering and how they will come to the benefit from the very
    first moment. For sure, right? You spend time, you give data, you sometimes pay
    money – of course, you want to know why.

    So it was not like in one day we went from 2 to 10 people or anything like that.
    It was more like, “Okay, let's see when we need new resources. What is important
    now?” For example, we just closed our last financial round for now – it's very
    specific for tech, because we have good vision and very important things to do
    on the technical side, so we started to grow the technical team. We are not one

    a great CTO, we did the technology, everyone could test it, so it was approved.
    I mean, it was not that easy, but at the end of the day, these were the milestones.
    The second thing was that what I already mentioned – people don't really believe
    that healthcare solutions can be sustainable from a business perspective, so that
    they can earn money. We understood that we can also use AI in B2B projects. That

    you can earn money. Over the last months and years, that became very important
    for them. I think nowadays, that's one of the main things you have to do as a
    company or as a founder – you must really prove, “Okay, we have the possibility
    to make money and not just a good idea. We don't need 100 million to get the first
    money. We also have good business cases already here.” But honestly, [cross-talk]

    more time. You have at least one kid, right? How did you even manage, even with
    one kid, especially when the kid was growing up, to do anything, let alone start
    a successful company? [chuckles]

- line: Yes. That was a challenge. Definitely. I mean, COVID was also there. So he
    was at home with me. But I have a very supportive surrounding. So, honestly, I
    take him to the company if needed. I take him to business meetings if needed.
    He's there and he's part of it. He was there from the beginning. I think it's
    the new generation and a new style of work we have. Of course, you have to be
    concentrated. I'm not saying I can do everything at the same time, but you need
    to be kind of flexible sometimes. Also, what works really well for me is to structure
    my day. There are hours I really just spend with him and there are hours when
    I definitely just work. It doesn't mean I'm working from eight to four – it's
    more flexible in my case. Because I have to pick him up from the kindergarten
    – there is no other way. Right?

- line: So I'm doing a flexible working model. But it works out pretty nicely. All
    our investors have known him from the beginning. Like I said, if we have an investor
    reporting meeting and I have to take him with me, he's on the side doing his things.
    He knows the procedure from the beginning. He's always telling me “Mommy, it's
    our company, right?” So he feels like he’s part of it. I think if you are relaxed,
    he or she is relaxed – you can handle it. But it's definitely a balance you have
    to find, and you need people around you to take care sometimes. I think the hardest
    part is to not be upset always – not feeling that you cannot reach all for the
    company, you cannot reach all for him. I think if you integrate things as both
    are part of me, that's the most important lesson I took.

    “Okay. Now, go draw something. I’ll have a one hour podcast interview and then
    we will play.” But when he was like four years old, or three, I couldn't really
    do this because he demanded attention now – not later. I guess with age, it becomes
    easier.

- line: As I mentioned, there's no right or wrong. It's more like an integrative journey
    that you spend together. I mean, being a founder is a decision, running your own
    business is a life decision – it's not just a job. So everyone is affected. That
    can be tough sometimes, but it also has good sides – very good sides. For example,
    I remember last time we talked about kindergarten-having issues with a new place
    and stuff and so on.

  who: Maria
- line: My little one just said, “Oh, mommy, we can open a business and sell and buy
    products for them, so they can earn more money to renew the classroom.” What you
    get out of it is that he just got an entrepreneurial spirit from the beginning.
    I mean, it's not a good thing for every child. I know that. But what you teach
    them and show them as what their mindset is getting through. Sometimes, just don't
    be afraid and protect them too much. They can handle a lot of things and they're
    very interested, so keep them on the journey. That worked pretty well, for me
    at least.
