short: From MLOps to DataOps
title: From MLOps to DataOps
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about MLOps and DataOps. We have a special guest today,
    Santona. Santona started her data journey as a researcher at CERN, then worked
    in NLP, and then worked as a Python engineer. She did many things, and one of
    those things was working at the company behind Airflow. Astronomer, right? She
    worked in the data space and now she works at Upsolver, where she leads data engineering
    and science, doing research. She will probably tell us more about that. She's
    passionate about building, as well as about empowering others to build end-to-end
    data and ML pipelines, which will be the topic of today. Welcome!

  time: '1:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you so much. Happy to be here.
  sec: 140
  time: '2:20'
  who: Santona
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. As always,
    thanks, Johanna, for your help. And let's start.
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Alexey
- header: Santona's background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of DataOps and MLOps, let's start with your
    background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 152
  time: '2:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, absolutely. So I'm a physicist turned ML engineer turned data workflow
    builder, kind of. I feel like I started as a full-stack data scientist because
    as a physicist, there was data engineering, modeling, feature engineering, machine
    learning, and then result presentation. So I think of myself as a generalist,
    and now I'm going even more meta, in the sense that I want to solve the problems
    that allow other people to solve their problems. So I'm passionate about building
    workflow authoring tooling in a way that is with the user in mind, where users
    are other developers like myself so that we can build the right kind of tooling
    that helps others do their work as simply as easily and as enjoyably as possible.
    That's me. [chuckles]
  sec: 161
  time: '2:41'
  who: Santona
- line: Can you maybe tell us about it in a few more details? Because it's quite a
    curious career journey. You worked as a researcher, then you worked as an ML engineer,
    and then you worked as a (I don't know if it's the correct way of saying this)
    as a data engineer – you worked in the data space, before that in the ML engineering
    space, and before that as a researcher. So what motivated you to actually go into
    ML engineering? You were a full-stack ML person as a researcher – you needed to
    do all these things. So why exactly ML engineering? How did it happen to you?
  sec: 219
  time: '3:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a great question. As I was leaving academia and thinking about
    what was next at that time, (this was in 2019-2020) NLP was pretty exciting. I
    mean, obviously, it's still very exciting.
  sec: 254
  time: '4:14'
  who: Santona
- line: It's getting more exciting every year. [chuckles] It's becoming more and more
    exciting.
  sec: 271
  time: '4:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. So I wanted to go in... I was just very, very eager to jump
    into that field. In physics, I was doing work with massive data and fast-moving
    data and all of those things, but they were mostly numerical and categorical –
    the data types. As I did just a few projects here and there on NLP or natural
    language-based applications, it was really refreshing in the sense that I, as
    a human, could interpret the models and the predictions' inferences that they
    were making in an intuitive way, that this algorithm was also doing. I think that's
    kind of what I latched on to. And so I started talking to folks that were doing
    NLP, and this opportunity arose where we were building a predictive routing engine
    using natural language queries to figure out how to best resolve them – how to
    best answer the questions that people were asking.
  sec: 275
  time: '4:35'
  who: Santona
- line: Yeah, that was a lot of fun. Building an intent architecture to figure out
    what people might ask in this entire network, per product and per language, and
    then curating that over time, training the classification models on those intense
    – it was just a lot of fun. So I would say the transition was a bit narrower in
    the sense that I was mostly thinking about ML algorithms, deep neural networks,
    and sort of the production pipeline in which they were deployed, as opposed to
    a more end-to-end process. And then the other difference was the kind of data
    and so on and so forth. But it didn't feel like a huge transition. [chuckles]
    Because I mean, at the end of the day, it's still data and ML pipelines and serving
    some end-user purpose.
  sec: 275
  time: '4:35'
  who: Santona
- line: Just text instead of numbers. Then you convert text into numbers, and then
    it's all the same.
  sec: 400
  time: '6:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. [laughs]
  sec: 407
  time: '6:47'
  who: Santona
- line: Then this is how you ended up being an ML engineer, right? [Santona agrees]
    Of course, you needed to deploy all these neural nets that you created, and you
    needed to deploy the chatbot – these things needed to be scalable and whatnot.
  sec: 412
  time: '6:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly.
  sec: 426
  time: '7:06'
  who: Santona
- header: Focusing on data workflows
- line: But then you decided to go... I think you said “even more meta,” right? Focused
    more on data workflows. So how did that happen?
  sec: 428
  time: '7:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think... Well, a lot of things sort of fell into place. But I started
    using Airflow at Directly in the production stack, and workflow authoring. It
    all sort of comes down to how your pipelines are orchestrated, or if the orchestration
    is abstracted away, that's even better. But a lot of the “engineering” component
    of data and ML pipelines has to do with “Okay, what are my dependencies? When
    do things get executed? What do I do when things go wrong (fallback protocols,
    etc.)?” So, thinking about the pipeline line as a main asset, as a main thing
    to take care of, is the direction in which I was going. I was also excited by
    the fact that this was Astronomer, which was a company that was managing the Airflow
    OSS. It was just also that I joined the data team very early, as it was being
    formed, so it was a lot of open green fields (open opportunity) as far as what
    we were going to be able to do.
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Santona
- line: The component of that job that was most fun for me, which maybe I didn't even
    realize when I was joining, is the user research aspect of it. I was now thinking
    beyond the use cases that I had come across, be it particle physics or NLP, to
    “Okay, what is everyone else doing? What is everyone else trying to do with Airflow?”
    Or more generally, “What are the pipelines? What kinds of use cases are there?”
    So I really enjoyed learning across domains, across industries, what folks were
    trying to do and what their pain points were. That got me more and more excited
    to solve these problems. Following that thread is how I ended up at Upsolver.
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Santona
- line: SQL is kind of the lingua franca of data. I really enjoy working in Python.
    The other component of this is that I love going to places where I know the least
    and then building up my education there. As a physicist (as a CERN physicist),
    I was working in C++ and some Python. The data structures are these trees – tuples
    of tuples, nested data structures that we have – our custom storage methods and
    our custom query methods, and so on and so forth. All of that is to say, I've
    never used SQL before. [chuckles] I started using SQL to query data directly and
    then, through the years, I learned better SQL. So that's actually part of the
    motivation for coming to Upsolver. We author pipelines, or in our platform, you
    author pipelines just as SQL. You just define the outcomes that you want and then
    everything that needs to happen to make that possible is handled by us. And of
    course, we have our own dialect. For example, we have these keywords like “sync”
    versus “unsync” that sets a dependency – that allows you to say what the dependencies
    between pipeline components are. That's sort of the thread that I followed. [chuckles]
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Santona
- header: Upsolver vs DBT
- line: I never used Upsolver. I only sometimes receive marketing information from
    you, in addition to webinars. But I've never actually seen that tool in practice.
    What you described sounds similar to DBT, right? You have a bunch of SQL queries,
    the tool looks at these queries and then figures out in which order these queries
    need to be executed. Is this a correct assessment?
  sec: 648
  time: '10:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a fine analogy to draw. DBT is a good partner of ours, so there's definitely
    an Upsolver plus DBT story. Specifically, we do a few different things and I want
    to sort of delineate between them. One is pipeline authoring (workflow authoring).
    You can go into our UI and author, you can use our CLE Python SDK, or in DBT,
    actually, you can author Upsolver pipelines. And then we have the actual engine
    that executes it. So DBT doesn't have its own execution engine.
  sec: 672
  time: '11:12'
  who: Santona
- line: So DBT delegates it to the data warehouse [Santona agrees] to Snowflake, BigQuery,
    whatever.
  sec: 710
  time: '11:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Or to Upsolver. With our new DBT connector, you can write the pipeline
    in DBT and execute in Upsolver. Then the second component is, we have a data lake
    where the data actually lives and flows through, and where you make your transformations
    on. Then the most recent thing that we added to this already pretty, pretty end-to-end
    tool is a focus on data ingestion. We guarantee high-quality data ingestion, whether
    you ingest it into Upsolver or Snowflake (which is also a good partner of ours)
    or just your S3 bucket.
  sec: 717
  time: '11:57'
  who: Santona
- line: For complex data sources, we've found that that's another pain point that
    folks are struggling with – if it's CDC. If you want to do Change Data Capture
    on your production databases, or you have to pull in data from queues like Kafka
    or Kinesis, and you're usually used to batch data processing in Airflow, for example,
    then this is sort of a different set of tools that you have to think about or
    a different mindset. So we're making that very easy – streaming data, large files,
    nested structures, and so on and so forth, is sort of our specialty. What we do
    on the ingestion front is guarantee strong ordering, guarantee... The things that
    data engineers usually have to think about while they're doing transformations,
    we just take care of the front end.
  sec: 717
  time: '11:57'
  who: Santona
- header: ML pipelines vs Data pipelines
- line: So a lot of data engineering stuff you mentioned. I remember a while ago,
    we had a podcast episode about MLOps here (I think it was like two years ago),
    and one thing that the guest, Theo, said back then was that you should never confuse
    a data pipeline with a machine learning pipeline, because a machine learning pipeline
    is a very special sort of pipeline. So do not do that. This is a big mistake.
    I'm wondering, what are these ML pipelines and data pipelines? Can you maybe tell
    us in a few words what they are, and what the main differences between these two
    are?
  sec: 805
  time: '13:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, absolutely. I think it comes down to the application. What is the ultimate
    value that you're trying to add to your end users? When I worked at Directly,
    where our product was this predictive routing engine, where the ML model was the
    thing that was deployed, and what was receiving data, making a prediction on it,
    and sending that prediction to end users – that was an ML pipeline. The data engineering
    aspects of that were very ML-focused, which is to say, as you said, the question
    is asked on some UI and then comes through to Directly through RabbitMQ. Receiving
    that question vectorizing it, and doing all sorts of filters on it – that is data
    engineering. This is very, very different from, for example, analytics engineering,
    which is happening in Snowflake, let's say, where you're interacting with the
    data, you're doing SQL transformations and these things.
  sec: 845
  time: '14:05'
  who: Santona
- line: So it's very focused in some sense, it's a very focused use case, very specialized
    use case. It can be computer vision, or NLP, or multimodal models, which are also
    very common. It can be numerical data, but still, the feature engineering that's
    happening, you usually kind of do the deep dive as an ML engineer, or even as
    an ML model. You do the deep dive, you figure out exactly how your data needs
    to be transformed in order to serve this ML use case in production. As opposed
    to most data pipelines today (maybe someday this will change) but the vast majority
    of data pipelines today are serving analytics use cases, where you might still
    have ML as part of the pipeline, but it's not the main... It's not a first-class
    citizen.
  sec: 845
  time: '14:05'
  who: Santona
- line: It's only because you think that there's some pattern, some trend, to extract,
    that makes more sense with a regression or with a classification or something
    like that. So to me, that's the difference. Here, you're starting with data from
    different sources – again, the source is less relevant – but once your data is
    in your system, you're really looking at the data, figuring out how different
    entities in the data relate to each other. For example, you get your product data
    from your application database. You get your CRM data from Salesforce. You get
    your Zendesk data, et cetera, et cetera. And then you have to create this model
    of “Okay, what are the different primary entities in my data? What's the mapping
    between them? How do things relate to each other?” And then you try to get to
    a representation of all of that data that can help serve analytics use cases downstream,
    which might be other data engineers on dedicated teams – there are different models,
    as we know, there's data mesh, etc. There are different ways in which you can
    power that, but the main focus is building an understanding of the business and
    then serving up that understanding to end users.
  sec: 845
  time: '14:05'
  who: Santona
- line: Often, the users are internal, and your customer success team wants to know
    when a certain client is going to churn – that's the person you're serving. The
    other shift there is, “Who's the persona that I'm building for?” So yeah, I agree
    with the other podcast speaker. I think they're very different. There are certainly
    elements that are in common. At the end of the day, data is flowing through both
    pipelines. But the architecture of the pipeline should always be use case-driven,
    application-driven.
  sec: 845
  time: '14:05'
  who: Santona
- line: Lastly, you didn't ask this, but I'll sort of add it – we use the word “Ops”
    And I think that it's a little bit up in the air as far as how you define it.
    Or maybe there isn't, but I have decided that I use a very simple definition of
    Ops, [chuckles] which is that it's all the steps that I need to take to consistently
    deliver value to the end user from whatever the thing is – from data or from ML.
    So if I have an ML model, great. It already does everything that I need it to
    do, but getting it from there to actually serving end users consistently and reliably,
    with little to no downtime, that sort of that's my Ops portion.
  sec: 845
  time: '14:05'
  who: Santona
- header: MLOps vs DataOps
- line: So using your definition, MLOps would be steps you need to take to deliver
    value from a machine learning model. And then DataOps would be steps you need
    to take to deliver value from what exactly – SQL queries?
  sec: 1124
  time: '18:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I would say from all of your business data. Yeah, I don't know. Do you
    agree that a lot of data applications today are really that we're trying to build
    an understanding of the business? The representation... the final... I mean, there's
    no final state, but usually, parts of your Snowflake database, or whatever else
    database, that you're exposing to other users are meant to be a complete representation
    of all the data in the business.
  sec: 1139
  time: '18:59'
  who: Santona
- line: I do agree. Although being a data scientist, I have a somewhat biased view
    on this, because most of the data pipelines I worked on were more like, “How do
    I transform the data in order to feed it into a machine learning model?” Even
    though it was mostly data engineering pipelines, still, the last couple of steps
    were mostly training a SciKit Learn model and publishing the model somewhere.
    For me, my understanding of the difference between a machine learning pipeline
    and a data pipeline, based on this experience, is that an ML pipeline is a more
    specialized version of a data pipeline.
  sec: 1177
  time: '19:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: You have different steps that are ML-specific – most of the steps are not
    ML-specific, but then you have feature engineering or extracting numbers from
    text, (the vectorization thing that you mentioned) and then training a model,
    which is ML-specific, and then publishing this model software. So these last few
    steps are ML-specific, and the rest or not. For me, the distinction was that it's
    just a more specialized version of a data pipeline, but based on your definition,
    or based on what you described, it looks like these are quite separate things.
    One is focused more on ML, and in the other, you focus more on business understanding.
    What they have in common is the pipeline part, which is all this orchestration,
    but the rest are different. Is this a correct understanding?
  sec: 1177
  time: '19:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: And they can have the data in common as well. For example, at Directly, primarily
    our ML product was there, but we also did analytics. We did analytics, we ran
    SQL queries on the data that had come in – all the historical data – and then
    what was going on with their ML model, like performance, and so on and so forth.
    I think that there's definitely overlap, and there's definitely a closed marriage.
    I mean, definitions are only as good as they're useful.
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Santona
- line: I think the only useful part of the way (that I like to think of it [chuckles])
    is that if you are a data engineer who has been building an ML pipeline, or a
    certain service of an ML product – let's say not at a startup, where you're doing
    things end-to-end, but rather at a larger organization, such as Reddit or Netflix
    or something, where there is a big ML-based product.  A recommendation engine
    is what serves the end users, and you have ML engineers that are developing models
    and deploying models and looking after them in production.
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Santona
- line: There might be separate data engineers, who are called data engineers, and
    they're more in charge of what's happening upstream. That's another way of splitting
    it up – within the ML application pipeline, you've got upstream data engineers,
    and downstream, you've got ML engineers. That's totally a valid data engineer
    persona and workflow. The one thing I will say is that a data engineer is used
    to doing different work than a data engineer at a company whose main purpose is
    something else. Let's say it's not an ML-based model. Hmm... It's really hard
    these days to find companies that don't have ML as a product. I'm really struggling.
    So your end-user product is something that's... Astronomer, let's go with that.
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Santona
- line: It's just a managed Airflow service, there is no ML component to that. So
    what were we doing as a data team? Our focus there was data engineering for the
    purpose of building business understanding and serving those up. There, we were
    thinking much, much, more about, “How do I represent the data in a way that makes
    sense to our business partners across the organization, not our ML model.” So
    you're thinking human-centrically. You're thinking in terms of, “What is the mapping
    here?” And you're doing a lot more data modeling. You're doing a lot more of those
    views and tables. As you go down the pipeline, you're getting more denormalized
    because you're building these mappings and complex relationships.
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Santona
- line: It's just a very different kind of workflow, in my opinion – having experienced
    a little bit of both, granted. I definitely want to learn from folks who have
    done more of either. But I wouldn't hire someone who is building data models and
    SQL primarily for analytics use cases into a data engineering position for an
    ML use case unless they were eager to make that switch, and unless they were eager
    to learn whatever gaps there were. It's not a one-to-one mapping between those
    two data engineering roles.
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Santona
- line: Even the tools are different, right? For ML to use cases, you might have tools
    like Airflow, Spark, Kinesis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and all these things you mentioned.
    But for the first case – for developing business understanding – the tools are
    different. The tools could be DBT Upsolver and these kinds of things. I think
    when you were saying that, here, the main goal is to build a pipeline and develop
    this business understanding and think, “How do I represent the data in a way that's
    understandable for business?” I think there is a term for that right now, called
    'analytics engineering,' right? Am I correct?
  sec: 1497
  time: '24:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, I think so, yeah. I was pretty excited to see the term come out. I
    don't see it being used as often. I don't see a lot of people with analytics engineer
    as a title, but I think it makes a lot of sense.
  sec: 1543
  time: '25:43'
  who: Santona
- line: We have a data engineering course at DataTalks.Club and one of the modules
    there is about DBT, which we call it analytics engineering. It seems like it's
    kind of synonymous – people who call themselves analytics engineers usually use
    DBT and if you use DBT you're kind of an analytics engineer. But I think this
    comes from the DBT lab. So they came up with this term to kind of differentiate
    between usual data engineers and these business-oriented data engineers.
  sec: 1559
  time: '25:59'
  who: Alexey
- header: Tools used for data pipelines and ML pipelines
- line: Okay. So we started talking about the tools already. What I wanted to ask
    is, what sort of tools are usually there? I gave a few examples, but maybe you
    have some more examples? What kind of tools do you need for different pipelines
    – for data pipelines or for ML pipelines?
  sec: 1603
  time: '26:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, I think you hit the nail on the head. The common stacks today
    are still... there's some orchestration engine, it could be Airflow – I mean,
    nowadays, there are Prefect, Dagster, Mage, etc. Depending on what kind of transformations
    you're doing, you could also use, let's say, Spark or Absolver or something like
    that for the ML pipelines. It all depends on how you break up your workflow. That's
    the thing I love about the modern data stack. [chuckles] There are things you
    hate about it as well, but you can sort of pick and choose your different pieces
    and build your own. So it's like building your own adventure, kind of. You can
    definitely... I think it's less about the tooling. But on the other hand, I will
    fully agree with you that  DBT would be hard to use in an ML pipeline, I think.
    Probably. I'm sure there, there are teams that are doing it. Again, that's the
    fun part.
  sec: 1627
  time: '27:07'
  who: Santona
- line: But the warehouse aspect of the data landscape, I think, is much closer to
    analytics engineering and analytics use cases than ML. Nowadays, feature stores
    are becoming a thing, and vector databases and stuff. Obviously, we were building
    those things for NLP ML applications. Even three years ago, we were building those
    in-house. It's a data lake in an S3 bucket with the hive meta store, and so on,
    and so forth. Nowadays, there are managed services for that, which I think is
    cool. Any sort of abstraction, or any time you can take away some work and abstract
    it away, I think it's great. But it's more focused around... as a human, you don't
    really need to fully grok and understand the data – how it lives and how things
    relate to each other – as long as you have that layer of metadata that retains
    that information. You can have a programmatic querying of it and usage of it.
  sec: 1627
  time: '27:07'
  who: Santona
- header: The “modern data stack” and today's data ecosystem
- line: You mentioned one thing – the modern data stack. You said it's a good thing
    because it consists of many different components, and you can kind of replace
    these components. But what is this modern data stack? I see this term used quite
    often. For me, modern data stack is... You have DBT, you have Snowflake, and then
    some things for ingestion, and then you call this thing a modern data stack? Is
    that right?
  sec: 1756
  time: '29:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think that's certainly a common way to define it. For example, Upsolver
    would be the third thing – Upsolver for ingestion and then Snowflake and DBT.
    That's your modern data stack. That's really all you need for your analytics use
    cases. But it's a choice, right? It's a choice that you're making. You also have
    these platforms, like Databricks, that have different pieces that allow you to
    do all of those things. I mean, you should always make build and buy-in decisions
    by looking at exactly what you need for your use case. It's hard for me to attach
    the idea of a data stack with specific brands and specific companies. Again, what
    I love about today's data ecosystem, and perhaps it's incorrect for me to use
    the term “modern data stack,” more generally, in today's data ecosystem  (new
    three-word acronym) [chuckles].

  who: Santona
- line: What is cool is that there are these specialized tools that you can pick and
    choose from. Again, if I do an ML application, I don't really want to be working
    with Snowflake and DBT, because then I'm going to feel a little bit lost because
    I don't have Python in my hands. Granted, Snowflake now has better Python support.
    But that's the whole thing – rather than thinking about tools, which then you're
    at the mercy of the tool to come out with the thing that you're used to, or the
    thing that you need, you can instead say, “Okay, fine. My data lives in Snowflake.
    Great. I can still get it out and work in my Python environment and then bring
    in my ML libraries and do the rest of the work.” To me, that's the modern data
    experience.

  who: Santona
- line: “Modern data experience” or as you already mentioned “today's data ecosystem”.
    [Santona chuckles] So what are the building blocks of this data ecosystem? You
    mentioned Snowflake, which is a data warehouse, which is the place where we eventually
    put all the data – the data is already cleaned and ready to be used for analytical
    purposes. But what are the other components of this ecosystem?
  sec: 1911
  time: '31:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Often, there is a data lake, whether it's surface to end users or not, as
    you said. Even within Snowflake or Databricks, in tabular representation as well,
    you usually have a bronze, a silver, and a gold – raw, ingested, and modeled,
    and then “marked,” etcetera, etcetera. So there's that, and you can sort of choose
    where the data warehouse comes in, in that data pipeline. But often, before we
    ingest it into Snowflake, we will still stage the data somewhere externally, in
    a lake, whether it's...

  sec: 1977
  time: '32:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are different patterns. If you use a dedicated ingestion tool, then
    usually... I'll start with the definition. Data is coming in from some source,
    and it's going to be in a raw format. You pull it into a place that is meant to
    be accessed only programmatically and not by individuals. The access controls
    are programmatic. Then, from that data staging area, you pull the data into a
    warehouse, where it's more human-centric.
  sec: 1981

  sec: 2022

    data, you take it from that place.
  sec: 2023
  time: '33:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, that's a way you could design it, for sure. Also, it's part
    of your data pipeline, right? I think the staging area is useful because, even
    if it's regular (every day at 1 PM, my data from Zendesk is pulled into my GCS
    bucket or my S3 bucket, and then another, let's say Airflow DAG, picks it up from
    there at 3 PM, or the DBT model picks it up.) Does it really work with S3? Probably.
  sec: 2028

  who: Santona
- line: I don't know. [chuckles] [inaudible] Yeah.
  sec: 2070
  time: '34:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: But yeah, it pulls it into my warehouse. The staging area is useful because,
    if you do have catastrophic failures, then that's a place to catch it. Or if you
    need to wait for some data, like let's say some service is down and you need to
    wait for the data, and so on and so forth. At Upsolver, we're sort of turning
    that idea on its head.
  sec: 2073
  time: '34:33'
  who: Santona
- line: We're enabling you to do all of those things, like stopping the pipeline if
    there's a catastrophic failure, or if there are bad quality rows in your incoming
    data, choosing what to do with them, such as drop or warn or etc. In this ingestion
    portion, without having to think about the stage, or without having to think about
    the actual, underlying lake underneath it – we actually don't need a lake in the
    way that we've written it – the data does move pretty much continuously through
    without really stopping in the Upsolver SQL lake, but it gets a lot of the benefits.
  sec: 2073
  time: '34:33'
  who: Santona
- line: Anyway, the main thing with a staging area is that it's a holding area. No
    one's supposed to be learning anything – no one's supposed to be querying it –
    no one's supposed to be making business decisions on top of it. It's like a buffer
    zone. I think over the years, we've iterated toward more abstracted staging and
    more hidden staging. In Fivetran and Upsolver, your data will come in and be staged,
    but it's within the service. You don't have to think about setting up an S3 bucket
    or a GCS bucket for that staging. So again, abstraction is great.
  sec: 2073
  time: '34:33'
  who: Santona
- line: It's happening, but under the hood. As the data engineer, the user of Fivetran
    or Upsolver or another ingestion tool, I do not really think about that. It's
    happening under the hood, but all I care about is that the data is being moved
    somewhere. Right?
  sec: 2178
  time: '36:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yep, exactly. Yeah, the data is being moved into my warehouse or the “lakehouse,”
    basically – the lake that I want the data to persist in and want to be able to
    query.
  sec: 2198
  time: '36:38'
  who: Santona
- line: And if something happens, then I rely on the tool to re-do this thing. I don't
    manually go to this buffer zone (to the stage) to do things. I don't even know
    about its existence, the tool just pulls it from somewhere and re-does the work.

  sec: 2228
  time: '37:08'
  who: Santona

    this is how the data ends up in a warehouse, but it's in raw form. Right? We haven't
    processed it yet. [Santona agrees] That's the first initial step for a data pipeline.
    What happens next with this data?
  sec: 2230
  time: '37:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sorry, when you say “We haven't processed it yet,” we haven't done any complex
    transformations. [Alexey agrees]
  sec: 2250

  time: '37:43'
  who: Santona
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 2266
  time: '37:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we don't really think of them as transformations. They're more of various
    cleaning or quality assurance mechanisms of sorts. For example, this is where
    we would dedupe data. It's the kind of thing that you'd have to, later on, say,
    “Oh, let's do a select distinct on my table,” you don't have to do that anymore
    because every entry is guaranteed to appear only once and then exactly, once consistency
    is strong [inaudible]. So those are the kinds of things that we do. The other
    thing that you can do with Upsolver (I'm not so sure about Fivetran and others)
    – this is where you can set your PII strategy (your governance strategies). So
    if you have a field that you want to mask, or if you have a field that you want
    to hash, you can configure those things through the Upsolver UI. So when the data
    appears, let's say in Snowflake, which is for, again, for human consumption, (the
    data is already sanitized in some ways) the things that are hidden, any duplicates
    are dropped and data are strongly ordered.
  sec: 2267
  time: '37:47'
  who: Santona
- line: There is some initial pre-processing, which might be enough for some use cases.
    It's already ready for some consumption. But maybe for more complex queries, for
    more complex reports, then a data engineer or an analytics engineer, needs to
    take this data and do some extra transformation.
  sec: 2342

- line: That is the next step – transformation. Right?
  sec: 2363
  time: '39:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right, that is the next step – transformation/some degree of modeling. The
    way that I've done it, and I think it's generally a fairly good way of doing it
    is – your data is going to come in from a number of different sources, even at
    small startups. If you have an analytics team, you're going to be able to bring
    in like 10 different sources of data. [chuckles] So the next stage after your
    data has landed in your warehouse or (lake house) is to figure out... Well, you
    have primary keys coming in from the data source, but what are the mapping keys,
    the foreign keys? What is the relationship between each of these, let's say tables,
    that have come in and what can we build on top of that? “What do we actually want
    to answer for my business?”
  sec: 2365
  time: '39:25'
  who: Santona
- line: Usually, there are very specific questions and this is why it's important
    for the data engineers and analytics engineers to talk to the end users – the
    other teams within the visit the business partners – To understand, “What exactly
    are you trying to answer?” Then I go, sort of back-propagation and figure out
    “Okay, to answer this question, I need to pull in data from this table, this table,
    not that table,” and so on, and so forth. So that's the kind of modeling where
    you're thinking in terms of business entities and business questions. So I think
    that's what's next.
  sec: 2365
  time: '39:25'
  who: Santona
- line: Here, this is the transformation/modeling phase, when we actually prepare
    data in order to show it as a report or a dashboard. Here, we need to work closely
    with business people, we need to talk to them, we need to understand what all
    these keys mean – foreign keys, like everything you mentioned – and we also need
    to make sure that business people, who consume this information, also understand
    what's happening in the result we give to them. Right?
  sec: 2455
  time: '40:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, and there are optimizations that you want to do as a data analytics
    engineer. You want to make sure that your data isn't “super” denormalized [chuckles]
    and that the same thing doesn't exist in many, many different places. The lookup
    indices across your tables should be efficient. I mean, there are lots of things
    to sort of... for example, in a data and motion pipeline, if your sources are
    streaming, then this is the stage where you think about what downstream use cases
    rely on these streaming upstream use cases, and how do to keep them in sync.
  sec: 2485
  time: '41:25'
  who: Santona
- line: Let's say I need to combine two different Kafka queues to answer a question.
    How do I make sure that that transformation in the downstream application gets
    the relevant data from each of those two streams? That's another thing, sometimes
    in the batch world, we don't have to think about that, because things are happening
    in batch. But in a tool like Upsolver, where we're combining batch and streaming
    and have this “streaming-first” mindset, then this is where you would really think
    about, “How do I do transformations that respect and stay true to the data dependencies
    and still answer the questions?”
  sec: 2485
  time: '41:25'
  who: Santona
- header: What happens after the modeling phase

    phase, and then? Do we have anything else after that?
  sec: 2575
  time: '42:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: That depends. [chuckles] Actually, we said one thing that I want to double-click
    on. [chuckles] Dashboards and reports and other deliverables, I think are actually
    a little bit further downstream, and we shouldn't really be thinking about them
    at the transformation/modeling stage. The requirements are important. I want to
    know what dashboards folks are wanting to see, or more specifically, what questions
    they want answered. This is something that I said earlier in a LinkedIn post,
    and it resonated with folks – you shouldn't come in with dashboard requests to
    your data team, you should come in with, “This is what I wanted to know. I want
    to know how this entity that I care about is going to change, or what's the trend,”
    and so on and so forth. And then the data team works with you to figure out exactly
    how that breaks down, what the metrics are, and how we want to present them.
  sec: 2585
  time: '43:05'
  who: Santona
- line: But I think that the whole process is still a little bit further downstream
    from the modeling because, at the modeling stage, you want to get to a place where
    you feel that the main entities of your business, for analytics purposes, are
    covered – are being regularly updated. Then on top of that, there's a second layer
    of transformations, where you're just going from “Okay, I'm taking these entities,
    and I'm just writing the transformation that answers my question.” And in some
    places, this is called “mart,” or you could go a bit more directly from those
    entities into your dashboards, but there are these two layers. There's ingested
    data, models data, and then there are answers.

- line: Ingested data, model data, answers. I wonder how different it is for a machine
    learning pipeline. Because in an ML pipeline, we also have a modeling phase, but
    it's a different kind of modeling phase. But I guess some things are similar,
    right? We might still have some ingestion phase. Maybe it's not our team who is
    doing that, but somehow it's happening, and then we have the data that we can
    use for transforming the data in such a way that we can use it in order to train
    a machine learning model. So I guess it's somewhat similar.
  sec: 2697
  time: '44:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: We have ingestion, then we have transformation, then we have modeling, which
    is a different kind of modeling because in the case of a data pipeline, the modeling
    is more about what kind of things we have in the database – in our data. But here,
    the modeling is actually training the model. Then finally, there's all these other
    things like serving the model instead of creating dashboards. So it's kind of
    similar. Right? But the tools we use are different.
  sec: 2697
  time: '44:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's kind of similar. But if my application is an ML application, I don't
    really need to model the data, as you said, by the entities. I don't have to build
    this business understanding for the ML model to then use that to answer questions.
    Because by that time, it's already cognitively simple and there are other ways
    to do it or with simpler ML models. In that sense, the feature engineering or
    data engineering component for the ML application is more focused around, “How
    do I best featurize the data for the ML model, not for human beings?” Largely,
    I feel like it's a matter of whom the data model that I'm building is for.
  sec: 2761

  who: Santona
- line: If it's for analytics use cases, for humans, then that's a different mindset,
    as opposed to if it's for powering an ML model and for a machine to pick up –
    then it's different. In feature engineering, you're absolutely right, I have to
    think about a lot of the same things. I still have to de-duplicate my data, if
    a field has nulls too often, then I have to figure out how to fill that in or
    drop, or whatever decisions I choose to make. But at the end of the day, my output
    is this sort of vector space – this large (or maybe it's not that large, maybe
    it's smaller) but all of those decisions I'm making as an ML engineer (as an ML
    application-focused person) and I am working with the data to get it to a better
    form for my machine to be able to pick up.

    things – all these different steps like ingestion, staging area, and all that
    – but you were an Airflow user. So I'm wondering, how did you convince Astronomer

    experience in physics as well – just writing data pipelines end-to-end, doing
    the data transformations that I needed to do, and so on and so forth. So it wasn't
    really a big challenge. [chuckles] There are things that I learned, of course,
    along the way, coming out of academia that were different. I think the main thing
    that I found was that things needed to be translated a little bit. In physics,
    specifically in particle physics, we used Cron, we had a custom built job scheduler,
    that was just like most orchestrators and schedulers. Underlying that was just
    just Cron. We had to set our own dependencies and we had to set our priority on
    things like, “How important is this job to run?” Because the jobs were really
    really massive. [chuckles] So when it needs to be run by and then put in a queue,
    and then it gets reprioritized. All the same considerations – all the same underlying
    technologies were there, but we just had a different... We had a custom solution
    for each of the different parts because that's what we needed. We couldn't query
    our particle collision database with SQL or with pandas or something. I couldn't
    pull it into a pandas data frame.
  sec: 2920
  time: '48:40'
  who: Santona
- line: So I realized – and this is going out to folks who are maybe making this transition
    now or just trying to think how their skills relate. It's not useful for me to
    say, “Oh, I have the software. It's called root. And this is where the data lives.
    And I open the branch, and then in that data branch, I open the next branch,”
    and so on, and so forth. That's not useful. That may be what you're doing, but
    it's not what folks are gonna resonate with. If you instead explain “Well, the
    tool doesn't matter, but I have this deeply-nested data structure (event data)
    which is how my data is going to be created in particle collisions and how it
    has to be stored. And in order to do analysis and run aggregates on it, I have
    to be able to reach all the endpoints in my leaf nodes. I have to run filters
    across different events on those properties. Those are my features, and then I
    do ML on that.”
  sec: 2920

  who: Santona

    engine to minimize the loss function. But you don't have to talk about that. You
    can say, “Okay, and then I did this minimization. It was a regression, (or it
    was whatever else) and this is how I got to the answer.” So it's a level of coming
    out of the weeds, coming out of thinking about exact tools, and thinking about,
    “This is what I did, and this is exactly what you do as well, so you should hire
    me because I have experience doing this.”

    to access data – you needed to run some modeling, some training process on top
    of this data, and then you have a model. These are pretty much the steps you need
    to take now with SQL and SciKit Learn, right? I understand. Then you worked as
    an ML engineer, and then somehow you ended up at Astronomer. But you said you
    used Airflow, so it wasn't difficult for you to convince them to hire you. Or
    was it?
  sec: 3132
  time: '52:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah. I think that having used Airflow was a positive [thing] for sure,
    as was doing pipelines end-to-end. Again, we were just forming the data team,
    so there were some open questions around what the data team was going to be –
    what exactly the charters were going to be. Some of the work that I did at Astronomer
    was NLP analysis – again, ML for the purpose of analytics, so that's different.
    Or ML for the purpose of showing how you can use Airflow for ML. It was actually
    a hybrid role at Astronomer. It's a hybrid role at Upsolver as well. The kind
    of work that I do is really this... I write data pipelines. Sometimes I write
    data pipelines to show how a data pipeline can be written using best practices
    for a specific use case or for a specific domain. Sometimes I craft those user
    personas and user stories and these are based on real people. For example “My
    friend, who's Head of ML at this Series C startup is doing this. I know, he's
    pulling in data from these sources. He's using Prefect for orchestration.” Those
    things.
  sec: 3174
  time: '52:54'
  who: Santona

    is working at this feature flagging, A/B testing platform, and he has this frustration
    around... he's identified a data set that is incorrect. And for the last six months,
    he's been trying to stop all the downstream applications because they're flawed.
    So I write those pain points down and those user stories down, and then I think
    about “How do I solve this using the tool that I want to build and improve?” Then
    the data work comes in. It's after that market user research. It's after thinking
    about problems. Then I go to, “Okay. Let me actually write this pipeline, and
    let me use Airflow to do it (or let me use Upsolver to do it).” Now you see that
    their pain point is solved and it's simple in these [particular] ways. And there
    it is.
  sec: 3174
  time: '52:54'
  who: Santona

    data. One of the analyses I did at Astronomer was building a predictive model
    on how long a GitHub issue on the Airflow project is going to take to get resolved.
    So, it was an NLP analysis of the issue title and the issue comments, and then
    a multi-class classifier on top of that to say, “Hey, these 10 issues came in
    the last five hours. This one's going to take days to resolve. This can be done
    quickly.” So we can prioritize based on that.

    engineering. With the skills you got as an ML engineer, you could just say, “Hey,
    I know how to do this, this, and this. I might not be able to do this thing that
    you need me to yet, but I will learn. Hire me.” And then “Okay, you seem to be
    good enough. Let's hire you.” And then you just learn all the rest at work. This
    is how it works?

- line: “What is this term? Let me look it up.” Right? This is how it happens? [Santona
    agrees] Do you follow some resources online? Podcasts or some articles? Or does
    it just come up in conversations with colleagues? How does it work for you? How
    do you feed this curiosity? How do you know what you're curious about in order
    to learn about that?

- line: Yeah, that's a great question. I don't religiously follow any one podcast
    or publication. But I try to, again, build my own adventure from various sources.
    If you do it this way, the only concern is vetting. How do you vet the right sources?
    How do you make sure that what you're learning is a good practice as opposed to
    a bad practice? And that's tricky. For that, I mostly rely on my network of folks
    that I respect and admire, and I am very unafraid to just ask, “Hey, what do you
    think of this?” Or “I read this and this seems like a good idea on principle.
    Is this what you're doing or are you doing something else? And why?” So all of
    those conversations together with online resources is what helped me learn. I
    can't really speak to and say, “Oh, you should go read this or go listen to this.”
    Maybe someday I will, but not today. [chuckles]

- line: So you just have a pool of resources, you read from these resources (or consume
    these resources). For some things, you run them by your colleagues, friends, who
    can tell you “No, this actually is not exactly correct.” Then you re-think, “Okay,
    can I trust the source?” [Santona agrees] Or if they say “Yeah, totally. This
    is how I do this,” then you can see that you can continue consuming from this
    resource.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, because then you're getting the real experience from a person who's
    doing it and building it. I do really like, I should say, companies that have
    engineering-specific blogs, where they're talking about the problems that they're
    solving in a blog, outwardly. With that, again, you're getting the real experience
    with someone who struggled with something and then came up with something. Those
    are really informative to me.

- header: Santona's book and resource recommendations
- line: Okay. Last question for today. Are there any books or other resources that
    you can recommend, let's say, if somebody wants to learn more about these data
    pipelines that we discussed?
  sec: 3556
  time: '59:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: To learn about data pipelines? Again, I'm a little bit hesitant to recommend
    specific books. I think that, depending on what you want to do... because reading
    a book is also a time commitment. [chuckles] So there's that. But I hear that
    the Fundamentals of Data Engineering, by Joe and Matt, is really solid for learning
    data engineering skills. There are white papers that companies that are in the
    orchestration space will publish. I found those to be somewhat useful.

- line: My friend Bas, who I think is still at Astronomer (maybe not anymore) wrote
    a book on Airflow, basically. That's solid if you want to specifically learn orchestration
    with Airflow. But I think we're just moving a little fast right now – unless you
    are a fast reader and someone who learns really quickly – to rely too much on
    books, because they become outdated so quickly. [chuckles] Yeah just broaden...
    consume from other sources as well – podcasts like yours, talk to folks who are
    doing the actual work, and read shorter-form content as well.
