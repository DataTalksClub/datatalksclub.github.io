- header: Pastor’s background and early programming journey
- line: Hi everyone, welcome to our event. This event is presented by Redox Club,
    a community of people who love data. We have weekly events. During the summer,
    they are not so frequent but we still have events.

  who: Alexey
- line: By the way, I think the Grammarly suggestion is popping up. I haven’t used
    Grammarly in a while. Since I started paying for ChatGPT, I canceled Grammarly.
    Maybe I should update the slide. Anyway, I need to stop sharing my screen now.

  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: Now I’m opening the questions we prepared. Let’s start. Are you ready?
  sec: 94
  time: '1:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: This week, we will talk about learning machine learning while being a medical
    student and how self-learning turned into a career. We have a very special guest
    today, Pastor. He was a student and an active participant in one of our courses.
    He is also a very active member of our community.
  sec: 94
  time: '1:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m very happy to have him today. Pastor is a machine learning engineer and
    a mentor. He focuses on practical, hands-on work. While studying medicine at university,
    he took on a side project that introduced him to machine learning. He started
    sharing publicly during machine learning Zoom camp, which helped him get interviews
    and job offers.
  sec: 94
  time: '1:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: I actually didn’t know much before, so I’m curious to learn more. Welcome,
    Pastor, to this interview.
  sec: 94
  time: '1:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi everyone. Thanks, Alex. I’m really excited about this interview.
  sec: 170
  time: '2:50'
  who: Pastor
- line: Me too. I saw you have been very active, and in our courses we have a leaderboard.
    I think you were top in one of our courses?
  sec: 176
  time: '2:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I participated in the machine learning engineer course and I was first
    in my cohort. That was pretty cool.
  sec: 190
  time: '3:10'
  who: Pastor
- line: Great. Before we talk more about all that, can you tell us about your career
    journey so far?
  sec: 201
  time: '3:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I recently graduated from medical school, so I’m a medical doctor. Throughout
    my career, I learned programming and started working as a statistician. Then I
    moved to data analyst, data scientist, and data engineering roles.
  sec: 209
  time: '3:29'
  who: Pastor
- line: I went through pretty much the full data pipeline with various roles and projects.
    I love improving and learning new things.
  sec: 209
  time: '3:29'
  who: Pastor
- line: What motivated you? Healthcare and data science don’t seem very related. How
    did you get into programming while being a medical student?
  sec: 253
  time: '4:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Before graduating from medical school, I graduated in social science; I am
    also a criminologist. I took statistics classes and was a teaching assistant.
  sec: 277
  time: '4:37'
  who: Pastor
- line: When I started medical studies, I saw many opportunities to freelance in statistics
    and data analysis. My main motivation was to have remote work that could pay bills
    and was flexible enough to let me study. There are not many online roles with
    that flexibility.
  sec: 277
  time: '4:37'
  who: Pastor
- line: Starting my journey in data was a big opportunity to keep studying while working.
    I also found it exciting to investigate what the data tells you. That curious
    mindset was a good motivator.
  sec: 277
  time: '4:37'
  who: Pastor
- line: You studied criminology and did statistics as a teaching assistant. How did
    you get your first remote job?
  sec: 351
  time: '5:51'
  who: Alexey
- header: Learning new tools and skills on the job while studying medicine
- line: I signed up on Upwork, a freelance platform that matches you with jobs. My
    first project was helping someone with a statistics problem from school. It was
    a small project, around five dollars.
  sec: 365
  time: '6:05'
  who: Pastor
- line: I found it exciting to get my first five dollars online. It surprised me that
    people would pay a random guy they found on a board. The project was about helping
    people study, and they were willing to pay small amounts to get help.
  sec: 365
  time: '6:05'
  who: Pastor
- line: How did your online work progress after that?
  sec: 425
  time: '7:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: After seeing people willing to pay, I started learning more and amplifying
    my skills. I had no background with tools; my statistics class was on SPSS, which
    is mostly point-and-click, so there weren’t many foundations.
  sec: 432
  time: '7:12'
  who: Pastor
- line: I started using Excel, which I hadn’t known before, and got some roles using
    Excel. Then I saw opportunities in R, so I learned R, took many projects but they
    didn’t pay much, and there were few of them.
  sec: 457
  time: '7:37'
  who: Pastor
- line: Later, I got a major, long-term role that required learning Python. So I started
    learning Python. This was before ChatGPT. Everything was through courses, documentation,
    and practice. I often had R code on one side of my screen and Python on the other,
    translating because I knew R but had to write Python. That helped me build solid
    foundations in Python. The pandemic also helped because everyone was looking for
    remote freelancers.
  sec: 488
  time: '8:08'
  who: Pastor
- line: That’s interesting. From what I understood, you observed market demands, learned
    the skills, then applied them. First SPSS, then Excel, then R, each time picking
    up skills to apply in new roles. Is that correct?
  sec: 548
  time: '9:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, sometimes. Often, people asked me to take projects I didn’t know how
    to do, but I said yes and learned quickly on the job. It was intense because I
    had to learn fast to meet deadlines. That environment helped me stay motivated
    and effective. You have to work in motivating environments to meet deadlines while
    understanding requirements and learning how to deliver.
  sec: 579
  time: '9:39'
  who: Pastor
- line: Yes, it was a sense of seeing the market, but also learning skills while working.
    Since data is competitive, you can’t always say I don’t know. That might work
    at higher professional levels, but when starting, you sometimes have to push yourself
    to take unknown projects. It worked well for me because I succeeded in almost
    all projects. I was even one of the top-ranked freelancers on the platform. It’s
    hard and intense, needing early mornings and late nights learning and applying,
    but it’s fun.
  sec: 621
  time: '10:21'
  who: Pastor
- header: Balancing medical studies with data science work and motivation
- line: You were studying at the same time criminology and then medicine. That’s intense.
    I have a childhood friend who studied medicine to become a dentist. The first
    years learning basics common to all doctors were very intense. It’s motivating
    to hear you managed all that.
  sec: 704
  time: '11:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Medical studies are demanding. Switching between two domains helped
    me. Sometimes you learn approaches in medicine that apply to data and vice versa.
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Pastor
- line: I always pushed productivity and time efficiency, trying to make progress
    while maintaining balance. Those two fields combined well because data helped
    support my medical career financially.
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Pastor
- line: I don’t think it would be possible for me to manage one domain without the
    other. Medical school motivated me to do more in data. So from my perspective,
    I can’t imagine managing one without the other.
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Pastor
- header: Applying medical knowledge to data science and vice versa
- line: 'A question came in: The remote site where you found your first job was Upwork,
    right?'
  sec: 828
  time: '13:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, Upwork. It was different times. I think I started around 2016.
  sec: 834
  time: '13:54'
  who: Pastor
- line: Was it called oDesk or Elance back then? They merged later, remember?
  sec: 846
  time: '14:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: I started after that. I didn’t know those earlier platforms. When I started,
    it was just Upwork.
  sec: 856
  time: '14:16'
  who: Pastor
- line: Also, I didn’t know how to communicate well in English with people. Everything
    was written communication. I had to improve my English skills while working and
    learning.
  sec: 869
  time: '14:29'
  who: Pastor
- line: I took English classes throughout my life, but speaking one-on-one in a live
    environment was new to me.
  sec: 869
  time: '14:29'
  who: Pastor
- line: That’s not easy. I remember my first time in the States, how difficult speaking
    was. I was an English teacher with two degrees—computer science and teaching English.
    Still, coming there, I couldn’t understand a word people said.
  sec: 913
  time: '15:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: You think you know until you start talking with people.
  sec: 939
  time: '15:39'
  who: Pastor
- line: Yes. They were asking me to spell the name of the website, and I just spelled
    T-W-O-R-K.
  sec: 947
  time: '15:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: What is your medical specialty? Are you a generalist?
  sec: 947
  time: '15:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m a generalist. I just recently graduated from medical school, so when you
    graduate, you don’t have a specialty yet. Then you decide which specialty to pursue.
  sec: 960
  time: '16:00'
  who: Pastor
- line: I see. What are your next steps in your medical career? Do you need to work
    at a hospital first?
  sec: 975
  time: '16:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. In my country, after graduation, you must complete one year of service
    in a rural community. You practice medicine there, because even after graduating,
    you’re still learning.
  sec: 986
  time: '16:26'
  who: Pastor
- line: You cannot practice independently outside that one-year program. After completing
    it, you can work as an independent physician or apply to a residency program.
  sec: 986
  time: '16:26'
  who: Pastor
- line: Do you have a plan for this?
  sec: 1025
  time: '17:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now, my plan is to complete my one-year rural service. I like internal
    medicine, cardiology, and neurology but haven’t decided yet.
  sec: 1030
  time: '17:10'
  who: Pastor
- line: I’m trying to see if I can combine data and healthcare to build my career.
    I still need to figure out if I want to do that before or after specialization.
  sec: 1030
  time: '17:10'
  who: Pastor
- line: That makes sense. Specialists are in high demand in Germany. There are so
    few, and waiting times for cardiologist appointments can be two or three months.
  sec: 1059
  time: '17:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, many people I know went to Germany to practice medicine. It’s not
    that hard if you know German. You need to speak the language well. If you pass
    that, you can work there.
  sec: 1089
  time: '18:09'
  who: Pastor
- line: German is difficult. After living here 10 years, I still struggle with speaking
    it well. I work in IT, so I don’t use German daily.
  sec: 1105
  time: '18:25'
  who: Alexey
- header: Starting freelance work on Upwork and overcoming language challenges
- line: One thing you mentioned is that some things from medicine you could apply
    to data and vice versa. What examples do you have of skills or approaches that
    transfer between these domains?
  sec: 1124
  time: '18:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: In medicine, you acquire many skills, but one that helped me most was organization.
    In hospitals, you always develop a plan for patients.
  sec: 1145
  time: '19:05'
  who: Pastor
- line: You can’t have a patient without a plan or without knowing what to do next,
    even in complicated or uncertain cases. Having a plan helps keep things organized.
  sec: 1145
  time: '19:05'
  who: Pastor
- line: This skill helps me organize projects and know what to work on every time.
    You also develop the ability to prepare for uncertainty because it’s common in
    any domain or job.
  sec: 1145
  time: '19:05'
  who: Pastor
- line: From data, I learned the curious mindset. Successful data people are curious;
    they dig deep into why things happen.
  sec: 1219
  time: '20:19'
  who: Pastor
- line: This helped me notice things others overlook. For example, understanding why
    a patient behaves a certain way or anticipating probabilities helps in medicine.
  sec: 1219
  time: '20:19'
  who: Pastor
- line: When a patient arrives in the emergency department, you consider demographics,
    epidemiology, and environmental factors to estimate the probability of diseases.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Pastor
- line: Ranking diseases by likelihood helps you focus on what to study and prepare
    for, since medicine has an overwhelming amount to learn and patients have varied
    backgrounds.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Pastor
- line: For example, a patient with abdominal pain could have anything from a heart
    attack to food poisoning. The most likely cause might be food poisoning, but doctors
    first think about critical conditions that can kill, and they try to rule those
    out before considering less critical causes.
  sec: 1315
  time: '21:55'
  who: Pastor
- line: Reranking and organizing possibilities by probability, revisiting diagnosis,
    and striving to be accurate is something I learned a lot from data.
  sec: 1315
  time: '21:55'
  who: Pastor
- line: Makes sense. Makes sense. Interesting.
  sec: 1368
  time: '22:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Just relying on probability in healthcare is not enough because the most likely
    cause could be food poisoning, but the patient might have something more severe.
    You need to start with the most severe conditions and then eliminate them until
    you find the more probable cause.
  sec: 1368
  time: '22:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I was checking a website that uses GPT under the hood—a triage system
    where you type your symptoms. It evaluates your symptoms and asks questions, and
    you can see the logs.
  sec: 1386
  time: '23:06'
  who: Pastor
- line: One thing those applications fail at is reranking based on severity. They
    rerank just by probability. For example, a heart attack manifesting as abdominal
    pain is quite frequent but doesn’t appear until the 20th iteration in the system.
    That’s something that can be applied from data science to healthcare.
  sec: 1386
  time: '23:06'
  who: Pastor
- header: Joining the machine learning engineering course and benefits of live cohorts
- line: Speaking of the machine learning Zoom camp and our machine learning engineering
    course, how did you find out about this course?
  sec: 1443
  time: '24:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: I saw a post, I think on Twitter back then. I tried to sign up but didn’t
    know how to manage things because I hadn’t used Slack before. I reached out to
    you via Twitter, and you helped me set everything up. That was really motivating
    because I had my first blockage there but you were very responsive.
  sec: 1457
  time: '24:17'
  who: Pastor
- line: I don’t check Twitter or X very often these days. If someone’s waiting for
    my reply there, I apologize. It’s better to contact me by email. When you go to
    data talks club and fill in the form with your email, you receive an automatic
    message from me and can reply directly. That’s the best way to reach me now.
  sec: 1494
  time: '24:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Twitter is nice because I can reach people like you, Pastor, but it’s also
    draining. You may check something important and then find yourself half an hour
    later scrolling through random videos.
  sec: 1494
  time: '24:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. At that time, I was trying not to do too many things because
    I was kind of burned out. But I saw this chance to work on a live, hands-on course.
    Before that, I mostly went through Udemy, Coursera, or YouTube courses to pick
    up skills, but I didn’t have live interaction with others learning the same things,
    instructors, or a fixed schedule to help me keep pace.
  sec: 1536
  time: '25:36'
  who: Pastor
- line: We do courses in cohorts on purpose. For me, it’s difficult to follow a self-paced
    course, so I understand that well.
  sec: 1591
  time: '26:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: That was the first time I saw that model, and now it’s mainstream. Many people
    do live courses and engage with platforms like Maven. It’s becoming popular. I
    thought platforms like Coursera or Udemy would dominate, but in fact, live courses
    are taking over. I found it the most helpful way to learn with others.
  sec: 1605
  time: '26:45'
  who: Pastor
- line: So you found the post on X, struggled a little with Slack, and I hopefully
    helped you. Good to hear. After joining Slack, what happened next?
  sec: 1647
  time: '27:27'
  who: Alexey
- header: Engaging with the course community and sharing progress publicly
- line: I started going through the videos and engaging in the platform. I saw there
    was a leaderboard. I’m competitive and like to compete, even though you often
    say the leaderboard shouldn’t be the focus and learning should be the goal.
  sec: 1661
  time: '27:41'
  who: Pastor
- line: Still, the leaderboard helped me a lot. I tried to understand how it worked,
    submitted my homework, and did many posts each week. That helped because before
    that, I hadn’t posted on any platform. Sharing what I was learning was an amazing
    skill.
  sec: 1684
  time: '28:04'
  who: Pastor
- line: It was probably the best thing I did in my career putting my name out there.
    People don’t know who you are, and if you don’t market yourself, no one will do
    it for you unless you engage with others. That was one of the best things about
    the course. Being first in the cohort didn’t bring me anything by itself. What
    I did to reach first place is what really helped me.
  sec: 1723
  time: '28:43'
  who: Pastor
- line: In our courses, we encourage participants to learn in public and share their
    progress, which is why we have the leaderboard and give extra points for sharing
    on social media. Still, many people find it difficult to share their progress
    because they think, “I’m just a student; what I share isn’t valuable,” or they
    don’t want to post on social media.
  sec: 1778
  time: '29:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Did you have hesitations like that? If yes, how did you overcome them?
  sec: 1778
  time: '29:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'I did hesitate at first, but climbing the leaderboard helped a lot. I started
    posting phrases like “I’m learning this and that” on ML stuff. However, I took
    a different approach: instead of saying “I’m learning this,” I tried to own what
    I was learning. For example, I explained concepts like the ROC curve, how it helps
    understand classifier performance, and the steps to be aware of when plotting
    an ROC curve in Python.'
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Pastor
- line: That kind of ownership helped me to adopt the mindset that I actually knew
    what I was talking about and helped market myself as an expert in the field. This
    was one of the best things I did transforming posts from “I’m learning this” to
    demonstrating professional insight. When people look at your history, they see
    you explaining how to do ML classification or become an ML engineer. That approach
    helps a lot.
  sec: 1899
  time: '31:39'
  who: Pastor
- line: 'I see. One question here: you started sharing your progress during the course,
    and that helped you get interviews. Can you tell us more about how that happened?'
  sec: 1950
  time: '32:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: A few months after I started sharing online and posting MLS camp content,
    recruiters reached out to me. One was from Meta. That surprised me because I was
    just learning. I wasn’t prepared for a job at Meta but wanted to try the interview
    process to see how it feels and learn how to communicate with recruiters from
    big companies. That’s a valuable skill even if you aren’t ready for the job or
    think you won’t get it.
  sec: 1970
  time: '32:50'
  who: Pastor
- line: I wasn’t actively looking for opportunities, but a recruiter contacted me
    based on my LinkedIn posts. She said, “I’m from Meta. We think you’re a good fit
    for an ML engineer role and want to know more about you.” I went through the behavioral
    interview. Having a learning mindset is something they value a lot, but my skills
    and experience weren’t yet there.
  sec: 2027
  time: '33:47'
  who: Pastor
- line: It was a fun experience, and it surprised me how easy it is to get interviews.
    The hardest part is overcoming your fears to put yourself out there. Eventually,
    you might say things that aren’t totally correct, and people will point that out.
    If you overcome that fear and take ownership of what you post, it can really help
    you.
  sec: 2072
  time: '34:32'
  who: Pastor
- header: Using LinkedIn and social media for career growth and interview opportunities
- line: Thanks for sharing. The way it works on LinkedIn is that when you post, some
    followers or people following the same hashtags interact. If I like your post,
    my followers will see that I liked it. They may follow you, and when you publish
    your next post, their followers see it. Eventually, a recruiter sees it.
  sec: 2116
  time: '35:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is the power of social media. It’s amazing to be exposed like that. You
    just need to be active, but overcoming the hesitation or fear of posting something
    incorrect is not easy. Did you ever post something incorrect and have people point
    it out? How did that feel?
  sec: 2116
  time: '35:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, sometimes posts might be taken out of context or seem incorrect. For
    example, I posted a quote from the AI engineering book by Chip Huen that says
    AI engineering is building stuff on top of foundational models. Some people replied
    that it sounded like anyone with ChatGPT can be an engineer now, which is not
    the whole truth.
  sec: 2193
  time: '36:33'
  who: Pastor
- line: That’s true. AI engineering means building on top of models like OpenAI. Essentially,
    all you need is access to the API key, right?
  sec: 2234
  time: '37:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you simplify it to that, yes, but you still have to do a lot to make it
    work. I think my post wasn’t clear on that. People pointed it out, but I don’t
    take it personally. I try to learn from interactions.
  sec: 2247
  time: '37:27'
  who: Pastor
- line: Sometimes a small post and the debate it generates helps you reach more people.
  sec: 2247
  time: '37:27'

  sec: 2312
  time: '38:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Like Stack Overflow if you post something already covered, people will
    point it out strictly. I had questions with negative scores because they didn’t
    meet guidelines.
  sec: 2318
  time: '38:38'
  who: Pastor

    You just need to have fun with the content you post.

    a good question, people would criticize you.
  sec: 2382
  time: '39:42'
  who: Pastor
- line: I never had that problem. I’ve been active on forums since early internet
    days, so I guess I knew the culture.
  sec: 2387
  time: '39:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Back to our topic. You shared your progress during the ML Zoom camp, but you
    framed your posts like an expert rather than a student. You explained concepts
    like the ROC curve and how to evaluate classifiers from an expert perspective.
    That reframing helped you post more confidently.
  sec: 2406
  time: '40:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Also, since you worked on platforms like Upwork, you likely wanted to attract
    clients and recruiters. Did this approach help with that?
  sec: 2406
  time: '40:06'
  who: Alexey
- header: Building reputation, structuring learning, and leveraging course projects
- line: Yeah. Once I built my reputation, it became easier to get customers. Outside
    of Upwork, it was hard to find clients. After the pandemic, many lost clients
    and jobs became scarce, so I realized I needed to shift focus.
  sec: 2463
  time: '41:03'
  who: Pastor
- line: I tried your course. Before that, I didn’t even have a LinkedIn account, but
    I knew LinkedIn was a good place to find work. I opened an account and started
    posting there.
  sec: 2463
  time: '41:03'
  who: Pastor
- line: One interesting thing about posting online is that your audience grows with
    you. If you start sharing as a beginner, eventually your audience will include
    senior engineers who have followed you for years and might want to work with you.
    That’s something you need to keep in mind.
  sec: 2463
  time: '41:03'
  who: Pastor
- line: That’s cool. You didn’t even have a LinkedIn account before the course and
    created one just to post for points, right?
  sec: 2566
  time: '42:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I’m competitive. I even did two capstone projects because I missed the
    first week and started at a disadvantage. I climbed the leaderboard from a low
    position. Those two capstone projects really paid off.
  sec: 2579
  time: '42:59'
  who: Pastor
- line: Good work. How did you structure your work, especially sharing what you learn
    publicly? For me, preparing content is difficult. In our courses, we give seven
    points per week to encourage posting daily, but posting every day is not easy,
    even for longtime social media users. How did you manage that? Did you take daily
    notes? How did you structure your learning in public?
  sec: 2604
  time: '43:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sometimes I waited till the deadline and posted multiple times in a day. Usually,
    I took a lot of notes using Notion or Google Docs. Knowing I wanted to create
    content helped me write better notes because I was preparing something to share.
  sec: 2655
  time: '44:15'
  who: Pastor
- line: I didn’t overcomplicate posts. Sometimes I posted small fragments or quotes
    from what I learned. For example, explaining a regression model or what R-squared
    means can lead to many posts from just one topic.
  sec: 2655
  time: '44:15'
  who: Pastor
- line: I structured my posts by videos, aiming to get one post per video, which helped
    a lot.
  sec: 2655
  time: '44:15'
  who: Pastor
- line: Preparing posts requires notes, which means structuring your learning. So,
    not only does sharing publicly help others, it also helps you process and learn
    better. You probably double-check before publishing to ensure accuracy, which
    reinforces your learning.
  sec: 2748
  time: '45:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. You go through the material thoroughly, take notes, grow followers,
    find recruiters, and learn better all in one process. Doing it all at once saves
    time because you’re not pulling from multiple places.
  sec: 2803
  time: '46:43'
  who: Pastor
- line: What happened after the course? You finished first on the leaderboard with
    many extra points and did three projects the midterm and two capstones. Did this
    help you after finishing?
  sec: 2843
  time: '47:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I still share those projects whenever recruiters ask for proof of work
    or when I have projects needing examples. What stood out is that the projects
    include deployment, step by step, on AWS. That positions you as a cloud expert
    and machine learning engineer.
  sec: 2868
  time: '47:48'
  who: Pastor
- line: I used datasets from healthcare like skin cancer and pneumonia detection,
    which helped explain why I’m both a medical student and a data scientist people
    often ask why I combine those fields.
  sec: 2912
  time: '48:32'
  who: Pastor
- line: Those projects go through the full data pipeline and are interesting to me.
    I deployed them as a service capable of inference. Pre-ChatGPT era, you had to
    do everything yourself, so that was a cool aspect.
  sec: 2912
  time: '48:32'
  who: Pastor
- line: The projects are multi-purpose. I share them widely and am proud of them,
    even though I haven’t maintained or changed any code since publishing. They’re
    dockerized and deployed on AWS. The course teaches you to build things to last
    and be useful to others. Those projects helped me a lot.
  sec: 2970
  time: '49:30'
  who: Pastor
- line: 'Amazing. There was a question: after learning about machine learning, how
    did you obtain projects in that area? You partially answered it—sharing your learning
    attracted interviews, and sharing projects showcased your skills. What else did
    you do to get projects?'
  sec: 3018
  time: '50:18'
  who: Alexey
- header: Volunteering and mentoring with DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Coding Place
- line: When I started posting, I got feedback and followers on LinkedIn and X. I
    engaged with people and platforms like DeepLearning.AI, becoming a mentor for
    their courses and testing content. I also volunteered with Coding Place, a Stanford
    initiative that teaches coding live. Exposing yourself to the market by engaging
    with people helps. Doing more than average opens opportunities.
  sec: 3053
  time: '50:53'
  who: Pastor
- line: That extra effort helped me market myself as an expert and get projects through
    LinkedIn. People saw my posts about X and Y problems, then asked if I could help
    on projects, both freelance and full-time roles. Engaging with communities also
    brought people asking for help producing their projects.
  sec: 3112
  time: '51:52'
  who: Pastor
- line: You’d be surprised how many hiring opportunities exist outside traditional
    platforms like Upwork. LinkedIn and communities give broader reach. In ML Zoom
    Camp, many people join because they face problems needing solutions. If you engage,
    the chance of someone reaching out is higher. It’s not guaranteed but definitely
    increases your opportunities.
  sec: 3164
  time: '52:44'
  who: Pastor
- line: That’s amazing. Among other things, you mentioned you became an assistant
    for deploying AI, right?
  sec: 3228
  time: '53:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, as a mentor. It’s a voluntary role helping people with problems throughout
    courses. Being there helped me get an interview with DeepLearning.AI to work with
    them. Unfortunately, we couldn’t make that happen due to payment processing issues
    with their client, but it showed opportunities exist if you’re active on the platform.
    People reach out because you already know the work.
  sec: 3247
  time: '54:07'
  who: Pastor
- line: So you volunteered as a mentor at DeepLearning.AI and almost turned it into
    a paid job; you just didn’t finalize payment arrangements. You also mentioned
    the Stanford initiative to teach coding. What is that?
  sec: 3301
  time: '55:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s called Coding Place, a Stanford initiative teaching coding. Every April
    they release a cohort, assigning volunteers to 10-15 people to teach them coding,
    following Stanford’s computer science curriculum for beginners.
  sec: 3324
  time: '55:24'
  who: Pastor
- line: I volunteer there, teach many people, provide feedback, and suggest improvements.
  sec: 3324
  time: '55:24'
  who: Pastor
- line: I also mention your courses because their research shows your courses have
    high retention. People drop out less compared to other courses. They study what
    helps students stay on track, and your course already implements many effective
    strategies. I refer to you as an example of good course design.

    learning
- line: 'Thank you. We should wrap up soon. Here’s a question: medical education is
    demanding. How did you find time to learn and work on machine learning? You partly
    answered this; maybe you can expand before we finish.'
  sec: 3420
  time: '57:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Medicine has a huge amount of content. I tried to absorb everything efficiently
    and avoid repeating work. Whenever I learned something from your course, I took
    notes and used them both for posts and to build capstone projects.
  sec: 3448
  time: '57:28'
  who: Pastor
- line: Of course, I worked extra hours—waking early, staying up late—which I don’t
    recommend. Med school was hardest during final exams and hospital rotations. One
    thing that helped was structuring my time and keeping to-do lists, breaking big
    goals into smaller steps. Instead of looking at the entire MLS camp content at
    once, I focused on watching specific videos per day.
  sec: 3448
  time: '57:28'
  who: Pastor
- line: I took opportunities to learn on the bus or on my way to school. Financial
    savings helped me during rotations when I couldn’t work, as I spent more than
    100 hours per week in the hospital. The savings allowed me to focus on rotations
    without working.
  sec: 3529
  time: '58:49'
  who: Pastor
- line: Learning data helped me accomplish much more in medicine. I don’t think I
    could have done any of it otherwise. I’ve enjoyed the process as much as possible.
  sec: 3529
  time: '58:49'
  who: Pastor
- line: That’s really cool and motivating. Having limited time forced you to be more
    effective at learning.
  sec: 3593
  time: '59:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. It forced me to be productive and follow the best principles. Sometimes
    I got tired, but being consistent is what pays off.
  sec: 3600
  time: '1:00:00'
  who: Pastor
- line: Consistency is key—same with running, gym, studying. Thanks a lot for joining
    us today, Pastor, and sharing your story. I hope it motivates many future ML Zoom
    Camp students. I wish you all the best in your medical and machine learning careers
    and whatever you choose next, since your interests are diverse.

description: Learn how to build a healthcare ML portfolio, land Upwork freelance gigs
  and deploy Dockerized models to AWS—practical tips, capstones, and career strategies.
intro: How do you go from medical school to shipping production-ready healthcare ML—and
  get paid for it on platforms like Upwork? In this episode Pastor Soto, a machine
  learning engineer and mentor who transitioned from medicine and criminology into
  production ML, walks through the practical steps he used to build a healthcare ML
  portfolio and freelance career. <br><br> We cover his career trajectory (statistician
  → data analyst → data engineer), the skill progression from SPSS and R to Python,
  and the first Upwork gigs that taught him by doing. Pastor explains how ML Zoomcamp
  and public learning—publishing exercises, leaderboards, and focused content—attracted
  interviews and opportunities. He also breaks down portfolio tactics (Notion notes,
  capstone projects using healthcare datasets), production topics (Dockerized models,
  AWS deployment, wiring APIs, feeding LLMs), recruiter visibility on LinkedIn, and
  soft skills like English communication and handling critique. <br><br> Listeners
  will come away with concrete, repeatable strategies for building a healthcare machine
  learning portfolio, landing freelance work, and deploying models to the cloud—plus
  time-management and mentoring practices that make it sustainable.
