description: 'Learn prescriptive analytics & robust optimization for supply chain
  pricing: align ML predictions to decisions, scale models, pick solvers, and boost
  revenue.'
intro: 'How do you turn machine learning predictions into better real-world decisions—especially
  under uncertainty in supply chains and pricing? In this episode Dan Becker, Founder
  & CEO of Decision AI and former Google data scientist and Product Director at DataRobot,
  walks through prescriptive analytics and decision optimization for practical business
  impact. With a background that includes top Kaggle performance and contributions
  to TensorFlow and Keras, Dan explains how to formulate optimization problems, choose
  objectives and constraints, and integrate ML forecasts into prescriptive and robust
  optimization models. <br><br> We cover robust vs. stochastic optimization, aligning
  loss functions with business objectives, and the solvers and tools that make this
  work—OR-Tools, Gurobi, Pyomo and open-source options. Dan also digs into scalability,
  approximation techniques, and deployment: pipelines, monitoring, and feedback loops.
  Use cases include supply chain optimization, resource allocation, and pricing/bidding
  strategies, plus operational, legal, and ethical constraints. Listeners will get
  practical guidance on evaluation metrics, common pitfalls like mis-specified objectives
  and overfitting decisions, and the cross-functional skills needed—data science,
  operations research, and software engineering—to get started with prescriptive optimization
  projects.'
