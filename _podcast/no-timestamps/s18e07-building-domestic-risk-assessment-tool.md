short: Building a Domestic Risk Assessment Tool
title: 'Build a Domestic Risk Assessment Tool for Triage: Data, Models, Privacy &
  Deployment'
description: 'Learn to build a domestic risk assessment tool: data cleaning, risk
  scoring models, privacy and deployment strategies to improve triage and resource
  allocation.'
intro: 'How do you build a domestic risk assessment tool that meaningfully improves
  triage while protecting people’s privacy and avoiding bias? In this episode Sabina
  Firtala from Frontline’s AI product development walks through the end-to-end process
  of building a domestic risk assessment tool for triage. Sabina brings hands-on experience
  across data wrangling, visualization, statistical testing, model training and validation,
  with a background in Natural Sciences and prior analyst roles in finance and SaaS,
  plus freelance work for mission-driven projects. <br><br> We cover problem framing
  and project scope, data sources (case management systems, public records, surveys),
  and data preparation: cleaning, linking and feature engineering. Sabina explains
  risk scoring and model architecture, evaluation metrics and bias assessment, and
  practical privacy, ethical and legal compliance measures. Deployment topics include
  integrating risk tools into frontline workflows, user interface and decision-support
  design, stakeholder training and trust, plus monitoring for model drift and alerts.
  The episode also addresses operational constraints, partnerships, funding and open
  resources. Listen for concrete guidance on building, evaluating and deploying a
  domestic risk assessment tool—focused on impact, fairness, privacy and sustainability.'
