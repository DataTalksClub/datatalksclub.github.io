short: Mastering Data Engineering as a Remote Worker
title: "Build IoT Platforms & Data Pipelines for Remote Work: Hiring, Onboarding & Personal Branding"
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about doing data engineering as a remote worker, among
    other things. We have a special guest today, José. José is a computer scientist
    who is currently focusing on data engineering. Previously, he worked in different
    fields like software engineering and backend engineering. He likes writing, and
    he's in charge of a data engineering newsletter, but he will tell us more about
    it during the interview. So welcome to the show, José.
  sec: 69
  time: '1:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, thank you so much. I'm very happy to be here.
  sec: 98
  time: '1:38'
  who: José
- line: As always, the questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer.
    Thanks, Johanna, for your help.
  sec: 103
  time: '1:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: José's background
- line: Before we start – before we go into our main topic of doing data engineering
    remotely and other things – Let's start with your background. Can you tell us
    about your career journey so far?
  sec: 110
  time: '1:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. I studied for a computer science degree in Spain and I worked
    in several Spanish companies. For the last year, I have been working in Norway
    and living in Norway, as well. That's the quick introduction. [chuckles]
  sec: 122
  time: '2:02'
  who: José
- line: Well, that's quite a change from Spain to Norway, right? From very hot weather
    to more cold.
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [chuckles] Right now it's quite good because right now in Spain it's
    almost 45 degrees (Celsius) and it's kind of very hot. Right now we have I think
    almost 20 degrees. It's raining, but... [chuckles]
  sec: 164
  time: '2:44'
  who: José
- line: Oh, I see the benefits, right. [chuckles] Have you seen the Northern Lights
    yet?
  sec: 184
  time: '3:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Yes. I saw them.
  sec: 191
  time: '3:11'
  who: José
- line: Amazing. You need to send some pictures. It's a dream of mine to see them.
    Which city are you in right now?
  sec: 195
  time: '3:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now I'm living in Dragsvik, which is quite a small village. This week
    I'm moving to Bodø, which is in the middle north of Norway.
  sec: 204
  time: '3:24'
  who: José
- header: How José relocated to Norway and his schedule
- line: How did you end up in Norway? What's the story there? Did you just find a
    job there and relocated, or did you specifically want to go to Norway?
  sec: 261
  time: '4:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. In fact, we moved here because of my partner. She got a big interesting
    offer to work here. So, we decided to move here. Neither of us have lived outside
    Spain, so it's a good opportunity. And we are here. [chuckles]
  sec: 269
  time: '4:29'
  who: José
- line: So you work remotely currently? Right? [José agrees] So you live in a village,
    and your job (your employer) is also based in Norway, but you work remotely. So
    how is your day organized? How do you do this?
  sec: 301
  time: '5:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Most of the days, it's the same, but it depends on the working hours of my
    partner, honestly. Because I have no specific working hours. Most of the days,
    I have two blocks of three-four hours and these blocks are split somehow – it
    depends on how things are going in the day.
  sec: 318
  time: '5:18'
  who: José
- line: So you have two blocks of three-four hours, and you just put them in some
    slots, depending on the availability of your partner – when she is not available,
    or when she's working. How strict is your schedule? Do you always work at the
    same time or sometimes you work at night and sometimes during the day?
  sec: 369
  time: '6:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now, it's very stable. I start working at 7 a.m. and the first block
    is from 7 or 8 to 11. And the second one usually goes after I have a little break.
    That's right now.
  sec: 392
  time: '6:32'
  who: José
- line: '[chuckles] So you don''t have a long siesta anymore?'
  sec: 425
  time: '7:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no. I actually should have one because I wake up at five in the morning.
  sec: 428
  time: '7:08'
  who: José
- line: Oh. Why, so early?
  sec: 435
  time: '7:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Why? Because it's good for me to not just start working right after waking
    up. I need some time to wake up and warm up first. The first thing I do is go
    out and do a workout.
  sec: 438
  time: '7:18'
  who: José
- line: So when you found this job, was it already remote first? Or did you have to
    somehow negotiate this in your contract that you will not be able to come to the
    office, that you will live in that remote village, and you will only work online?
  sec: 476
  time: '7:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I did not negotiate the remote position. Because the offer that my partner
    received was to work within several months. We live for three months in one place
    and we live for six more in another place. My first requirement was to work remotely.
    Funny thing is that it was hard to find a remote job in Norway, but I finally
    got it.
  sec: 493
  time: '8:13'
  who: José
- header: Tech companies in Norway and José role
- line: I have no knowledge whatsoever about the job market in Norway. What kind of
    companies are hiring there? Do you have typical big tech companies like Microsoft,
    Google and the like? Or is it more just Norwegian companies?
  sec: 551
  time: '9:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's more Norwegian companies. I don't really know if Microsoft or Google
    are here. [chuckles] But yeah, most of the companies are Norwegian.
  sec: 578
  time: '9:38'
  who: José
- line: Can you tell us what you do?
  sec: 596
  time: '9:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now I'm working as a software engineer, with a focus on IoT platforms.
    I handle the current platform, which is in progress right now. I'm heading the
    project. We are two people, so we have not so many possibilities.
  sec: 599
  time: '9:59'
  who: José
- line: In what area is the company? What exactly does the company do?
  sec: 638
  time: '10:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's the mechanical industry. I don't know if it's the specific area. They
    usually build big platforms like fishing dunks in the middle of the fjord and
    these kinds of things.
  sec: 647
  time: '10:47'
  who: José
- line: I was kind of thinking, “Hmm... Is it related to fish and fishing?” Because
    all I know about Norway – I might have a very closed-minded and short-sighted
    view of Norway – but usually I know it [related to] fish. Because every time I
    go to a store, I see fish from Norway and my impression of that was like, “Okay,
    probably it's mostly fishing there.” [chuckles] What you do is also related to
    that, right?
  sec: 683
  time: '11:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. But it's not the food area – it's more the industry [aspect].
  sec: 714
  time: '11:54'
  who: José
- line: Okay, so you produce some stuff that is later needed for fishing? [José agrees]
    I assume that there are some sensors and whatnot, and your job as a data engineer/software
    engineer is to collect data from these sensors, correct?
  sec: 725
  time: '12:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 742
  time: '12:22'
  who: José
- line: You are building some sort of a platform for making the data easier to collect?
  sec: 744
  time: '12:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, essentially. Currently, we are developing a kind of operating system
    for all of this.
  sec: 749
  time: '12:29'
  who: José
- line: Can you say it again?
  sec: 772
  time: '12:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Currently, we are developing a kind of operating system for all of the
    projects – so how all this data is stored and how all the data comes in and goes
    out.
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: José
- line: I see that we already have a few questions. One of the questions is, “Why
    was it so difficult to find a remote job in Norway?” It seems like for a technical
    field, especially after COVID, there are plenty of options.
  sec: 797
  time: '13:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I thought that. But the point here is that most of the companies where
    I got an interview and had a conversation with, they always wanted me to be in
    the office at least once a week. It wasn't possible for me. For me, it was kind
    of difficult to find a job because my thoughts were, “Okay, after the pandemic
    situation – Norway is a big country. It's very big. The villages and the cities
    are very far apart, so it's the place to work remotely.” But it's not. [chuckles]
  sec: 819
  time: '13:39'
  who: José
- line: Most of the companies are probably in Oslo, right?
  sec: 888
  time: '14:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Oslo, Bergen, Tronheim – the big cities.
  sec: 891
  time: '14:51'
  who: José
- line: Okay, so what you needed to do was find a company that did not require you
    to go to the office and there were not so many options. What about companies that
    are not Norway-based?
  sec: 897
  time: '14:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I didn't have the opportunity to go there because I found the job kind of
    early... Well, not early because it took three months.
  sec: 914
  time: '15:14'
  who: José
- header: Challenges of working as a remote data engineer
- line: So what do your usual daily activities look like? Can you share some challenges
    of working remotely as a data engineer?
  sec: 931
  time: '15:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, the first one, I think, is the loneliness of working alone. I'm alone
    in my house and it's kind of difficult to react for people who are not so used
    to working remotely. My company is kind of, “Okay. You are able to work remotely.”
    But this is not the core of their business. My colleague is German – in Germany.
    So one of the biggest [challenges] is loneliness, I guess.
  sec: 943
  time: '15:43'
  who: José
- line: What do you do to overcome this feeling?
  sec: 1005
  time: '16:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I'm trying to. It's kind of difficult. I just try not to think so much
    about it – it's just work.
  sec: 1010
  time: '16:50'
  who: José
- line: Well, it's kind of like when someone says, “Don't think about an orange elephant.”
    And then all you can think about is this.
  sec: 1024
  time: '17:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Yeah.
  sec: 1032
  time: '17:12'
  who: José
- line: I think the phrase is a little bit different – I don't remember the exact
    wording. But if you just try not to think about it, it will come back. Do you
    do anything else? I assume that in a village, there are not so many things happening
    – there aren't meetups that you can join. Right?
  sec: 1034
  time: '17:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. I like living like this. I think it's not for everyone. Because I love
    being alone. I really like the feeling. But I know that this feeling is not for
    everyone.
  sec: 1054
  time: '17:34'
  who: José
- line: So it's a challenge, but on the other hand, you kind of take advantage of
    this and enjoy it.
  sec: 1079
  time: '17:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, absolutely. Do you have other challenges in your work? It doesn't have
    to be related to working remotely, but maybe just your work [specifically]?
  sec: 1083
  time: '18:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, one of the other challenges is living and working in the same area.
    I found this out when I was in Spain working remotely as well. It was [a situation]
    where my living room was the same room as for work. So it's difficult to say “Okay,
    I'll just stop working and set up the laptop and I'm here.” It's kind of difficult
    to switch because it's a single space. Yeah, it's a big challenge.
  sec: 1097
  time: '18:17'
  who: José
- line: Yeah, I understand what you mean. Well, probably most of us understand. During
    COVID, we had to work remotely and therefore live and work in the same space.
    I was very happy to actually come back to the office. But I know many people have
    different opinions about going to the office because you can save so much time
    on not commuting. You just wake up, do your stuff, and then open your laptop,
    work, finish your work, close your laptop and then you have one hour more in your
    day.
  sec: 1146
  time: '19:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, absolutely.
  sec: 1179
  time: '19:39'
  who: José
- line: Any other challenges?
  sec: 1183
  time: '19:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, probably for the last one, I usually try to split the space. It's a
    good approach to kind of prevent this situation. “Okay, I have one room and the
    living room, so I only have to work here.” So I try to block one space in the
    living room and this space is only for work.
  sec: 1187
  time: '19:47'
  who: José
- line: What about challenges of your actual work? I imagine that you need to deal
    with a lot of data. From what I know, IoT data usually involves large volumes
    – you have a lot of data coming from the sensors. So what are some challenges
    that are related to your work as a data engineer and dealing with these sorts
    of data?
  sec: 1231
  time: '20:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, for me, the first one was not being in the same place as the sensors
    where the data comes from. It's kind of difficult to explain that. Because in
    all of my previous jobs where I worked, I was just a software engineer – I just
    developed something and it was kind of abstract. But with IoT it's “Okay, we have
    this sensor that is connected to the temperature of a belt or an engine. This
    data comes from this engine. Yeah, you say that these data come from the engine,
    but I cannot see this physical thing.” It's kind of difficult to explain, though.
  sec: 1264
  time: '21:04'
  who: José
- line: From what I understood, (maybe I'm wrong) what you mean is – the engine with
    all the sensors is somewhere where you don't have access to it, and it would help
    for you to actually go there and see where the sensor is placed, how exactly this
    data is generated, etc. Then you would have more understanding of the data – how
    exactly this data is created, how it's captured, etc. It would help you as a data
    engineer to understand the data better and then process it better. participate.
    Right? [José agrees] Why would we actually need that? I'm just thinking, “Okay,
    there is some sensor.” You can conceptually visualize. “Okay, there is an engine
    and there is a tiny thing connected to it that sends data.” Why is it a problem?
  sec: 1352
  time: '22:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's not a problem. But for me, it was difficult. It was a challenge for me.
  sec: 1409
  time: '23:29'
  who: José
- line: Yeah, I guess being on-site and seeing how exactly this all works helps to
    get a better understanding.
  sec: 1419
  time: '23:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Right now, I'm uncomfortable with it. But the first time it was not
    really related to the same work that I did before.
  sec: 1424
  time: '23:44'
  who: José
- header: José's newsletter on how to make use of data
- line: I see. Maybe we can talk about general data engineering because I know that
    you have a newsletter, and your website. We have checked your website and one
    of the things that you mention there is that if you have some data and or streams
    of data – you just capture this data (you just save it) and you don't necessarily
    know what to do with this data. You just store it. And you say that you can show
    [people] how to turn this data from just a “mere paperweight,” as you call it,
    into a major asset in your business. This is a very loaded sentence, and it's
    very interesting. So how do you turn data that is just there (that you just keep
    and don't do anything with) into something that is useful?
  sec: 1444
  time: '24:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The first thing is to understand the business or the client's customers.
    What are you doing? Why are you storing this data? Is it just for having a big
    database? Is this data coming from the main part of your business? After that,
    after understanding the business, I'm able to do these transforms and all these
    things? I don't know how to explain that, actually.
  sec: 1507
  time: '25:07'
  who: José
- line: But you probably explain it in your newsletter, right?
  sec: 1574
  time: '26:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 1578
  time: '26:18'
  who: José
- line: Okay. I'm just thinking of what kind of follow-up question I can ask. I guess
    it's related to the challenge you mentioned. You said that for you, it's important
    to see where the sensors are placed. So you want to understand the data better,
    right? And this is what you need to do. If you have your data stored in the database,
    the first step you need to do is understand how exactly this data is created or
    what the idea behind this data is – what does it mean? Can you do that with any
    data? Why do you even capture this data in the first place? Do we need to capture
    all the data that is out there? Or maybe first, we need to understand what we
    want to do with this data and only then save it?
  sec: 1589
  time: '26:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think we first need to understand that not all data is usually worth
    [something].
  sec: 1640
  time: '27:20'
  who: José
- line: Okay. Let's say we have some datasets – a bunch of data that we store – we
    think it's useful, we start keeping it. It's been [lying around] there and we
    think, “Yeah, let's make use of this data.” What do we do next with it with this
    data?
  sec: 1654
  time: '27:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would try to explore it and see what information is there – the features
    and all these things. I don't know. I'm really bad at names – I think you would
    use the ETL process to find what is inside the data.
  sec: 1674
  time: '27:54'
  who: José
- line: But you would probably also need to have some sort of business case in mind,
    right? Why exactly would you create this ETL?
  sec: 1707
  time: '28:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's the point of understanding the business point first.
  sec: 1716
  time: '28:36'
  who: José
- line: And then you just create a pipeline – an ETL – and that's it? You call it
    a day? Is there anything else? How do you organize your work with stakeholders,
    for example, to show that, “Okay, here's the dataset. Here's some data. Here's
    our business understanding of this data. Here's our goal.” We create some pipeline
    and then what do we do next? How do we show the results to the stakeholders?
  sec: 1726
  time: '28:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Honestly, I don't know. [chuckles] I don't know. Right now in the process
    of getting there – I'm not ready to call myself a data engineer yet, because it's
    not what I do. Well, I do data engineering but I don't know how to explain that.
    Right now I'm not working with clients and stakeholders, so right now I don't
    have this process to go into.
  sec: 1757
  time: '29:17'
  who: José
- line: So who do you work with? You mentioned that you have a colleague in Germany.
    When you create your pipelines (when you create this platform) somebody needs
    to use it, right?
  sec: 1800
  time: '30:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 1813
  time: '30:13'
  who: José
- header: The process of making data useful
- line: I'm back, I guess. Yeah. What I was saying is that you and your colleague
    from Germany are creating a platform. So you somehow process data. This platform
    is for somebody – somebody needs to use it. I guess these would be your stakeholders.
  sec: 1821
  time: '30:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Our stakeholders right now are the other colleagues in the company who
    are responsible for putting and connecting all the sensors. Right now, this is
    the process.
  sec: 1843
  time: '30:43'
  who: José
- line: Can you walk us through this process? Let's say there is a new machine and
    you want to start collecting data from this machine. What exactly is happening
    after that where you decide, “Okay, we need to start collecting this data.”
  sec: 1864
  time: '31:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, the first thing we start with – I don't know if it's the starting point
    necessarily – we connect the sensor. Once it is connected, my colleague has to
    register this sensor to the system so the system is able to collect the data and
    process it. Processing the data is not storing the data at this time – it's real-time.
    This is the process right now. As I said, it's the ACM progress – that's the status
    right now.
  sec: 1880
  time: '31:20'
  who: José
- line: I see. Can you tell us what you wrote about in your latest newsletter issue?
  sec: 1937
  time: '32:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Not technical information, honestly. It's more about how we can use
    data for business. The main purpose of the newsletter is to explain how someone
    can get information and profit from data without being a technical person.
  sec: 1945
  time: '32:25'
  who: José
- line: How did this idea of starting a newsletter actually occur to you?
  sec: 1994
  time: '33:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: A good question. The idea was, “Okay, I'm a very technical person and I don't
    like people, honestly.” [chuckles] It's very difficult for me to speak with other
    people and to speak with stakeholders and explain technical information for people
    who have no technical background. So the point was “Okay, I like writing.” And
    I'm kind of trying to explain that in writing, but it's easier for me than talking.
  sec: 2002
  time: '33:22'
  who: José
- header: Where José gets inspiration for his newsletter
- line: So for you, being on this podcast is already quite an achievement, right?
    It's quite a challenge. Maybe achievement is not the right word. What I mean is
    that since it's difficult to speak with people for you and you prefer writing
    – sitting down, thinking of what you want to write about, and then structuring
    the material, and then explaining it. [José agrees] I see. Well, thanks for being
    here. I understand now. I imagine that there are many people like you – we call
    them introverts, right? I'm also an introvert. Sometimes it's hard to be around
    people all the time and you need to... in your case you decided to go to a Norwegian
    village. [chuckles] [José laughs] Maybe it's a little bit extreme. Yeah.

  who: Alexey
- line: So you decided to start the news newsletter to take time to put your thoughts
    into writing and explain how exactly to work with people – or to work with stakeholders
    and how to make use of data. How do you come up with the suggestions (with the
    tips) that you provide? Do you get inspiration from your work or from the internet
    or from social media?
  sec: 2055
  time: '34:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, from everywhere. One thing I have in mind all the time is everything
    that is going on around me can be an email. The key point of the email is not
    just for the data itself, it's more like entertainment. It's also working outside
    and just I kind of get the inspiration from – I don't know, I rock in the middle
    of the fjord. [chuckles] And I think about wanting to explain that situation somehow
    so that it's interesting for people. I try to convert this story into the data/business
    world. You know what I mean?
  sec: 2157
  time: '35:57'
  who: José
- line: More or less. [chuckles] So you get inspiration from everywhere and you say,
    “Okay, this should be interesting. This must be interesting for people. Let me
    try to work it out and put it in writing.”
  sec: 2242
  time: '37:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, maybe it's just a thing that just happened to me. I feel happy or I
    feel sad, whatever – it's okay. I try to explain that and how we can take advantage
    of it, but focus on the data world, which is kind of difficult, but...
  sec: 2256
  time: '37:36'
  who: José
- line: So you work remotely and I'm wondering... This newsletter that you have, do
    you think it helps you to put yourself out there – to maybe get attention, to
    get more opportunities as a remote worker?
  sec: 2290
  time: '38:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think so. I think so because one of the advantages that the newsletter has
    is the repetition. Every day, I write an email and my audience receives this email.
    With repetition, we have confidence. The big challenge is to get people into the
    newsletter.
  sec: 2316
  time: '38:36'
  who: José
- line: Okay. So you do it consistently – you do it every day? It's a daily newsletter?
  sec: 2359
  time: '39:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Daily, yeah.
  sec: 2364
  time: '39:24'
  who: José
- line: It must be quite difficult to come up with content every day. Is it not?
  sec: 2367
  time: '39:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Kind of. It depends, because most of the days I write the email, but it's
    not just one email. Maybe it's an idea and I have some ideas and I write four
    emails.
  sec: 2372
  time: '39:32'
  who: José
- line: What you're saying is that sometimes you have an idea, but you kind of split
    it into multiple days. You start and then on the second day, you continue, continue
    – until you work it out. Then you get another idea and you start writing about
    that too.
  sec: 2399
  time: '39:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It depends. [chuckles]
  sec: 2416
  time: '40:16'
  who: José
- header: Dealing with burnout
- line: 'One of the things that I remember from the COVID times is this feeling of
    burnout – when there are so many things happening: around the house, and at work,
    and everyone wants meetings, and there is a need to reply to emails. Then on top
    of that, if I also had to write a newsletter every day, I would probably go crazy.
    So how do you...? Do you even have this feeling of burnout sometimes? And if you
    do, what do you do to overcome it?'
  sec: 2420
  time: '40:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: One thing is going out. Here, I'm living in the middle of the fjord, so I
    just go out to nature and it helps a lot. It really helps. Another thing is exercise,
    which is very important to try not to think about work. Yeah, that's the two things.
  sec: 2463
  time: '41:03'
  who: José
- line: Previously, in Spain, you also worked remotely, right? Was it also a village
    or was it in the city?
  sec: 2509
  time: '41:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: During the pandemic I was in Barcelona. After the pandemic I lived in a small...
    it's not a village, just a small city. A town, yeah.
  sec: 2519
  time: '41:59'
  who: José
- line: Unfortunately, not everyone has access to nature – not everyone lives in a
    Norwegian village and can just go out and enjoy all these lakes, mountains and
    forests. I saw some pictures from Norway and all of them are so amazing. I'm kind
    of envious that you can just close your laptop, leave your house, leave your apartment,
    and then enjoy all that. But not every one of us has access to this. [José agrees]
    Say if you live in Barcelona, you don't have nature, really. Right? So what do
    you do there? Just go for a walk?
  sec: 2540
  time: '42:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Go for a walk. In Barcelona, there is the beach, so it helps. [laughs]
  sec: 2577
  time: '42:57'
  who: José
- line: Right, right. [chuckles]
  sec: 2587
  time: '43:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I always try to live or to go near nature.
  sec: 2590
  time: '43:10'
  who: José
- line: One thing you mentioned is doing some activities, like sports activities,
    for example. I remembered, “Okay, I'm already busy. There's so many things happening.
    How can I squeeze in sports?” What's your take?
  sec: 2600
  time: '43:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The first thing is – I usually do it the first thing in the morning.
    I try to prioritize myself before something else. I try to do this the first thing
    in the morning – just waking up and going out. I just realized it, because these
    three years have been, “Okay, I just woke up and started working, had burnout,
    and it's kind of difficult to escape from it.” Right now I think I found the way
    that works for me. [chuckles]
  sec: 2619
  time: '43:39'
  who: José
- line: So, everyone, move to a Norwegian village. [chuckles]
  sec: 2691
  time: '44:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not everyone, because...
  sec: 2697
  time: '44:57'
  who: José
- header: When in Norway, do as the Norwegians do
- line: Yeah, as you said, it's not for everyone. It's difficult to be alone, right?
    There are not so many social activities that you can do outside of work. Just
    curious, do people in Norwegian villages speak English or do you need to know
    Norwegian?
  sec: 2699
  time: '44:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Usually, they know English, and they speak in English, but they usually speak
    in Norwegian. I speak Norwegian a bit. Most of the time, we speak in Norwegian,
    but Norwegian people when we just speak, it is “Okay. I'm trying to speak in Norwegian,
    but you just switch to English because it's easier for you and it's easier for
    me.” But I'm trying to improve my Norwegian sometimes, so I say “No, no, no, let's
    speak in Norwegian.” So it's not a problem.
  sec: 2720
  time: '45:20'
  who: José
- line: So you try to speak Norwegian as much as possible. That's cool. I've spent
    so much time in Germany and because everyone speaks English, I use English most
    of the time [chuckles] even though technically I know some German to get around,
    I still just use English.
  sec: 2776
  time: '46:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I see that we have quite a few questions. I want to go back to these
    questions and we still have some time to cover them. The first question I see
    is, “Which websites would you suggest using to find remote work for beginners
    – for somebody who is just starting their career?”
  sec: 2801
  time: '46:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, here in Norway, there is a website where you can find everything. Right
    now I'm using it – it's fin.no.
  sec: 2823
  time: '47:03'
  who: José
- line: Okay. So for those who do not live in Norway, it's probably not very relevant.
  sec: 2844
  time: '47:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. [chuckles]
  sec: 2849
  time: '47:29'
  who: José
- line: Did LinkedIn work for you in this case? Or you had to use this website?
  sec: 2852
  time: '47:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it worked.... It works sometimes. I know some other ones. I am really
    bad at names. Upwork is a platform – website. But yeah, that's it.
  sec: 2857
  time: '47:37'
  who: José
- line: Well, if you're in Norway, then it's that website. I think you said fine.no?
  sec: 2884
  time: '48:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's finn.no – It's “find” in Norwegian. [chuckles]
  sec: 2891
  time: '48:11'
  who: José
- line: I see. The other question we have is, “What are the crucial steps in learning
    and doing data engineering to really master it?”
  sec: 2901
  time: '48:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Can you repeat?
  sec: 2913
  time: '48:33'
  who: José
- header: How to master data engineering
- line: “What are the crucial steps in learning and doing data engineering so that
    I can really master it?”
  sec: 2916
  time: '48:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm just thinking... The first thing.
  sec: 2938
  time: '48:58'
  who: José
- line: It's a very broad question, yes.
  sec: 2943
  time: '49:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I'll try [to answer]. I will say that... I don't know how to explain
    that. There is a big point, I think, that is having a very technical background.
    For those who don't have a technical background, I don't know.
  sec: 2946
  time: '49:06'
  who: José
- line: So what you would say is that you need to be a software engineer first in
    order to become a data engineer?
  sec: 2983
  time: '49:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: It will be easier, I think. I don't know how to answer that. [chuckles]
  sec: 2990
  time: '49:50'
  who: José
- line: Yeah, it's a very broad question because there are so many steps in doing
    that. Well, the first thing is to have a good technical background, right? Perhaps,
    if you do not have experience working as a software engineer, maybe this is what
    you can start with. So just work as a usual backend developer, or...
  sec: 2999
  time: '49:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, start working with small data projects, like a backend engineer or a
    backend developer. That would be good.
  sec: 3025
  time: '50:25'
  who: José
- line: So you start working as a software engineer and then you start working on
    small data projects. Okay. That's enough to master it?
  sec: 3043
  time: '50:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Uh, no. Keep going! [chuckles]
  sec: 3055
  time: '50:55'
  who: José
- line: Keep going. [chuckles] Okay. That's the most important part, right? I guess
    this is not the answer the person who was asking was really looking to get. But
    I think, if we need to think about that, that's the main idea, right? Work on
    projects and repeat until you master it. Kind of sounds simple. What I can say
    is – we have an entire course about data engineering called Data Engineering Zoomcamp.
    You can go there and check what modules are there. I think we have six.
  sec: 3057
  time: '50:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I will not talk about these exact modules. You can go and check. But the main
    idea of what José said is, just keep going – keep doing. Work on a project, work
    on the next project, work on the next project, and then – that's the best way
    to master it. Right?
  sec: 3057
  time: '50:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think there is no top. I think there is no “master”. You can stop
    the progress. It's the same as life.
  sec: 3116
  time: '51:56'
  who: José
- header: The legalities of working remotely in Norway
- line: Yeah. Right. Another question. I see a question from Elena. “Do you need to
    be registered in Norway for your taxes?”
  sec: 3132
  time: '52:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 3146
  time: '52:26'
  who: José
- line: So because the company is Norwegian, you have to be in Norway to be able to
    work for them. Right?
  sec: 3150
  time: '52:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. However, if you have a small company outside Norway, it's the same as
    if you work with the United States or another country. To work here, you need
    to be registered.
  sec: 3156
  time: '52:36'
  who: José
- line: Do you have a small company or what is your employment setup?
  sec: 3187
  time: '53:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now, I'm a full-time employee.
  sec: 3195
  time: '53:15'
  who: José
- line: So you're a full time employee without... So just the usual full-time contract,
    right? [José agrees] Okay.
  sec: 3200
  time: '53:20'
  who: Alexey
- header: The benefits of working remotely
- line: Another question from Elena is, “What are the benefits of remote work?” I
    think we partly touched on that. You save the commute time since you don't need
    to go to the office and back. For you, what are the other benefits of working
    remotely?
  sec: 3211
  time: '53:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not depending on a specific place. You can work from everywhere you want.
    That's the biggest benefit, I think.
  sec: 3230
  time: '53:50'
  who: José
- line: For you, it means you can work everywhere in Norway where you want or you
    can work everywhere in the world where you want?
  sec: 3254
  time: '54:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now, in the world. But it depends on your company – if it allows it
    or not. I was in Spain last month and two-three months ago, I was in Argentina,
    so there was no problem. At least for my company. [chuckles]
  sec: 3264
  time: '54:24'
  who: José
- line: Yeah, that's very convenient. Then you also said that you need to move every
    three months, right? [José agrees] So that's why you have to have this flexibility,
    because you're never in the same place for long, right? [José agrees] I'm really
    curious what kind of work requires moving every three months?
  sec: 3297
  time: '54:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. She's a nurse.
  sec: 3319
  time: '55:19'
  who: José
- line: A nurse?
  sec: 3321
  time: '55:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. She has a contract and more contracts. That's our point of view. Because
    like that we can explore the country while we are working. That's the biggest
    thing, we thought. That's a good opportunity.
  sec: 3322
  time: '55:22'
  who: José
- line: Yeah, that's really cool that we (people in IT, software engineers, data engineers,
    data people) actually have this possibility of finding remote work, right? Because
    for a nurse, it's not really possible to do things remotely.
  sec: 3357
  time: '55:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Very difficult.'
  sec: 3375
  time: '56:15'
  who: José
- line: Yeah, very difficult. Are there other advantages?
  sec: 3378
  time: '56:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think the one related to having more time. You have more time to be
    with your family, to do whatever you want. And that's a good benefit as well.
  sec: 3383
  time: '56:23'
  who: José
- line: Yeah, and I think we already talked about disadvantages, right? Loneliness.
    What else? Is it difficult to separate work from non-work? Did we talk about other
    things? Or is there anything else you would like to add to the list of drawbacks?
  sec: 3406
  time: '56:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now, no.
  sec: 3428
  time: '57:08'
  who: José
- header: José's recommendations
- line: Okay. Well, one question we always ask is if you have any resource recommendations.
    Is there a book, course, whatever? You probably can recommend your newsletter,
    I know. But apart from that, is there anything else you can recommend on the topic
    of either remote working or data engineering? Or maybe something else you recently
    discovered?
  sec: 3432
  time: '57:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Not a specific resource, but for technical people, it's very, very important
    to develop soft skills and try to improve them. I have no specific resource. There
    are a lot of them [in general].
  sec: 3456
  time: '57:36'
  who: José
- line: Soft skills is quite a broad set of skills. Would you recommend any specific
    skill and say, “Okay, if you want to start working on these skills, start with
    that one?”
  sec: 3489
  time: '58:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it's talking to other people. [chuckles] Try to do that.
  sec: 3507
  time: '58:27'
  who: José
- line: Well, you're here today, right?
  sec: 3513
  time: '58:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 3515
  time: '58:35'
  who: José
- line: Well, yeah, that's a very good recommendation. Even though it's not a resource,
    the recommendation is nevertheless quite good. So I think that's all we have time
    for today. So thanks, José, for joining us today, for telling us about your story,
    about your work setup, about the challenges, benefits, and your newsletter as
    well. So that's all for today.
  sec: 3522
  time: '58:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you so much.
  sec: 3548
  time: '59:08'
  who: José
- line: Yeah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today as well, and asking questions.
    Have a great week!
