- line: "The questions for today's interview were prepared, as always, by Johanna\
    \ Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, for your help. Actually, Johanna tried the app that\
    \ we'll talk about today. She liked SQIN H that the app reported. [Maria chuckles]\
    \ So yeah \u2013 thanks, again, Johanna. Usually, we start the interview\u2026"

- line: Before going to the main topic, we start the interview by talking about your
    career progression. So let's start with your background. Can you tell us about
    your career journey so far?
  sec: 49
  time: 0:49
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, sure. I studied electrical engineering in China, so I was always very\
    \ close to the technology side of things. And then I started to work for Siemens\
    \ \u2013 I did the transformation strategy for the managing board for mobility\
    \ and electrical things (all their energy stuff) which was quite interesting.\
    \ But I always felt like, \u201COkay, I want to do something, and to do a strategy\
    \ for something and then do it.\u201D So if there is a mistake or a wrong decision,\
    \ I'm the one who has to deal with that."
  sec: 59
  time: 0:59
  who: Maria
- line: "Then I got pregnant, and during this pregnancy, I decided, \u201COkay, now\
    \ it's the time to change everything because my life is changing either way.\u201D\
    \ That was the moment I decided, \u201COkay, let's found something. Let's transform\
    \ an industry that really needs to be shaped.\u201D That was healthcare. So we\
    \ started the idea of SQIN with an MVP, and then different financial rounds. And\
    \ yeah, here we are today!"

  sec: 117
  time: '1:57'
  who: Maria
- line: Five. So, you went into that five years ago, right?
  sec: 121
  time: '2:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. We started five years ago with the first ideas and our MVP. But we\
    \ always, as founders, believe that\u2026 For us, we didn't have the idea and\
    \ then we woke up in the morning and said, \u201CThis is exactly what we want\
    \ to do.\u201D It was more that we understood, \u201COkay, there is an area in\
    \ industry that needs help from the technology perspective.\u201D In healthcare,\
    \ you see limited resources, a lot of issues, a lot of people around the world\
    \ dealing with so many, many things. Infrastructure is not that good. So we always\
    \ believed, \u201COkay, we have to understand the industry first, and then we\
    \ can come up with a solution.\u201D"
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Maria
- line: "At these times, we didn't even talk about AI, honestly. It was more like,\
    \ \u201COkay, let's create technologies that can help here.\u201D So that's why\
    \ we started in the first one and a half-two years, more or less, with discussing\
    \ and getting to know all these different players \u2013 we have the regulation,\
    \ we have the pharmacists, the doctors, the patients, the hospitals, the pharma\
    \ companies with medication, and so on. So there are very, very different players\
    \ in this area, and if you want to come up with a technology or solution, you\
    \ have to deal with all of them \u2013 at least most of them. You have to understand\
    \ them. Therefore, we have an atypical founders\u2019 journey, I would say. We\
    \ really spent a lot of time on this MVP status quo, or bootstrap, to really know\
    \ what we have to come up with."

  who: Maria
- line: "Is your co-founder also a mom \u2013 somebody on maternity leave?"
  sec: 215
  time: '3:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Oh, no \u2013 my co-founder is a man. [chuckles] He\u2019s the experienced\
    \ one from the two of us? I would say he spent more than seven years in the valley,\
    \ discovering different startup journeys and different companies. We met at university\
    \ very much earlier and then just decided\u2026 [cross-talk]"
  sec: 223
  time: '3:43'
  who: Maria
- line: In China, right?
  sec: 245
  time: '4:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we then decided to go on that journey together.
  sec: 246
  time: '4:06'
  who: Maria
- header: Deciding to go into telecare (healthcare)
- line: "Oh, so you already knew your co-founder way before starting. Then you got\
    \ pregnant and thought, \u201COkay, your life is going to change anyway. Let's\
    \ start something.\u201D So you talked with the co-founder, and then you decided\
    \ to go into the healthcare industry. Right?"
  sec: 250
  time: '4:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. For me, that was a very interesting thing. After university, a group\
    \ of all my friends \u2013 most of them are entrepreneurs now, so most of them\
    \ started businesses pretty early. We just sat down together, and I said, \u201C\
    Okay, I feel like I'm ready to also do something,\u201D and then discussions came\
    \ up. So it was not always just the two of us, but at the end of the day, when\
    \ we knew, \u201COkay, this is what we will come up with.\u201D Then there was\
    \ a decision, \u201COkay, it makes sense. Let\u2019s start this journey together\
    \ as a team.\u201D"
  sec: 271
  time: '4:31'
  who: Maria
- line: "That\u2019s quite interesting. Why healthcare?"
  sec: 303
  time: '5:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think, five years ago, healthcare was an industry that was not really digitized.\
    \ They just started to think about, \u201COkay, what could be different in the\
    \ future?\u201D There was not even data. People, at least in Germany, started\
    \ to talk about the data gaps we have, and the lack of information as well. For\
    \ example, medications were just tested with male people \u2013 not even all of\
    \ them were women. So there was a huge change that you could feel in the way people\
    \ thought about health care."
  sec: 307
  time: '5:07'
  who: Maria
- line: "Rural areas, for example, started to say, \u201CWell, we have an issue with\
    \ resources because in a lot of doctors\u2019 offices, the doctors are turning\
    \ older and older, and we don't get new doctors here in our area.\u201D So it\
    \ was a time where you could feel that there will be a change in the system and\
    \ that it was time to do that in a sustainable way. It was not because one of\
    \ us studied in that field or something. It was really more about the potential\
    \ analyzes of different industries."
  sec: 307
  time: '5:07'
  who: Maria
- line: "In Germany\u2026 I live in Berlin, and the doctors still communicate with\
    \ each other using fax. I go do an MRI, and then they do the analysis of the MRI,\
    \ and send the results by fax to my doctor. It prints and everything. It's 2023\
    \ and we're still using faxes."
  sec: 371
  time: '6:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah! I mean, look at the papers for the pharmacies that are still printed\
    \ out. Of course, we all talk about electronic prescriptions, but where is it\
    \ in real life? So it's still something we are working on, even if we digitize\
    \ in very different areas, but healthcare, due to the regulations and the sensitivity\
    \ of data, is always two or three steps behind. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve\
    \ noticed how a lot of startup innovations are coming up in the last few years.\
    \ But most of them, from my perspective, were too innovative because, of course,\
    \ healthcare is one of the oldest industries and you cannot change the whole ship\
    \ with just one wave. Right?"
  sec: 397
  time: '6:37'
  who: Maria
- line: "You have to keep the people on board, you have to understand the whole system\
    \ (the ecosystem) and then you need to try to design something that keeps what\
    \ we have, but it's still going into the future. I think this is the main challenge\
    \ in healthcare. The second thing is that every area works differently. Not just\
    \ every country, but also the cities, or the areas (like the rural areas). You\
    \ need to see what you have. In the area where I come from, we don't even have\
    \ dermatologists or doctors for eyes or something \u2013 you have to go to the\
    \ next big cities to find some. So there are a lot of specifics, and you have\
    \ to understand them before creating a solution in healthcare."
  sec: 397
  time: '6:37'
  who: Maria
- line: Which area are you from?
  sec: 491
  time: '8:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I'm from Southern Brandenburg. So from Berlin, just going to the south. I\
    \ mean, my parents are still living there. The situation\u2019s not that easy.\
    \ My mom's always going to Berlin to see a doctor. It's about a two-hour ride.\
    \ I mean, we're talking about Germany, so we can imagine how other areas have\
    \ issues."
  sec: 493
  time: '8:13'
  who: Maria
- line: From Berlin, in two hours, I can be in Rostock or Dresden.
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, true. [chuckles]
  sec: 521
  time: '8:41'
  who: Maria
- header: Current difficulties in healthcare
- line: "It's a lot of time, two hours, if we think about that. Also, in big cities,\
    \ it\u2019s sometimes very difficult to book an appointment because all the doctors\
    \ are booked in advance."
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, definitely. That's why we always thought that we should not start with\
    \ the idea and think \u201COkay, how can technology be used to do the services\
    \ doctors do?\u201D We should think more about how to make them more efficient\
    \ or to make the whole system more progressive and more adaptable to new situations\
    \ and the load of people.\u201D Instead of saying, \u201COkay, we need to change\
    \ something.\u201D Because there are a lot of good things. They are quite good,\
    \ educated doctors here, so why not support them first? Why not get them on board\
    \ to come into a new chapter, a new era of healthcare?"
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Maria
- line: "So you realized that there is a problem, \u201CThis is definitely an area\
    \ where there's a lot of potential for digitalization.\u201D Then, because you\
    \ come from the south of Brandenburg, and your parents are still there, you see\
    \ the state of health care there. We also talked about the state of health care\
    \ in big cities like Berlin, where it's also not the best."
  sec: 577
  time: '9:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. What is very important to understand is that while I studied in China,
    I also lived for a while in Brazil. So I know other healthcare systems as well.
    Honestly, they're working pretty much differently and sometimes much more connected.
    I will always remember when I was invited to a conference in Stockholm (I would
    say, three and a half, four years ago) and they already came up with these kinds
    of good connections, data sources. They already thought about how it can be done
    because the country is wide, so people are definitely in different areas. I mean,
    there's so much going on around the world that, as a founder, I think one of the
    most important things is become aware of the things that are going on and not
    just be stuck in your own in industry, or country, or bubble (like the LinkedIn
    bubbles, where we always see these great success stories) but to keep yourself
    open to other perspectives and try to understand what is going on.
  sec: 603
  time: '10:03'
  who: Maria
- line: "You can see me \u2013 I'm currently in Jakarta, and before, I was in Singapore.\
    \ Honestly, I've had moments like, \u201CThat was so crazy!\u201D Just a quick\
    \ example \u2013 we always talk about how robots could probably change our life\
    \ or make our processes more efficient. But I was in Starbucks getting coffee,\
    \ and one of the robots just came to me and was asking me, \u201COkay, do you\
    \ have something I can put in the rubbish?\u201D So it's very much normal already\
    \ there. The things we are afraid of, are still talking about, are still conceptualizing\
    \ \u2013 they already exist in other places of the world. So bring yourself to\
    \ the hotspots of your industries and try to understand, \u201CWhat could be the\
    \ next level? What is the next step?\u201D Or probably. \u201CWhat could you learn\
    \ out of that?\u201D I mean, my little one was with me, so for him, it was quite\
    \ normal to see these things. But back home, it's still a huge discussion."
  sec: 603
  time: '10:03'
  who: Maria
- line: So what I got from this is, while you were in Jakarta, there were already
    robots helping people, while in the south of Brandenburg, there were no doctors.
    Right?
  sec: 721
  time: '12:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Kind of. Yeah, you could say that. Yes. [chuckles] At least from
    my perspective.'
  sec: 734
  time: '12:14'
  who: Maria
- header: Getting into the healthcare industry as a lifestyle brand
- line: "Yeah. [chuckles] Some five years ago, you realized that there is a gap and,\
    \ together with your co founder, who you already met before, you started learning\
    \ more about the industry. From my understanding, you didn't know much about this\
    \ industry. You just saw that there was a problem and that there was potential,\
    \ but you still needed to get time to learn about the key players \u2013 pharmacies,\
    \ hospitals, the patients, regulations, etc. So how did you approach that? What\
    \ did you do in these two and a half years?"
  sec: 740
  time: '12:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I would say we started very rough. We reached out to people or brands, or\
    \ hospitals, or whatever institutions \u2013 you want to know more about most\
    \ of them. Of course, you can start with Google and you could start educating\
    \ yourself, but we really did it in a cold way. We just called them or left messages\
    \ like, \u201CHey, we're currently analyzing the industry.\u201D We got some things\
    \ out of that. If you really try, you will always meet these innovative or early\
    \ adopters outside that are really open-minded and let you come in and give you\
    \ some good advice."
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Maria
- line: "I remember we had several different meetings, in hospitals, we went with\
    \ the doctors, we tried to understand the process that they are really going through\
    \ \u2013 not just what you see as a patient, but what are they doing in the backend\
    \ and in their systems. Of course, our jobs in previous companies helped us \u2013\
    \ we were \u201Cbusiness proven\u201D that we are not just someone, but that we\
    \ really wanted to do something. Also, we used a lot of accelerator programs to\
    \ understand the markets better and to understand the players better, especially\
    \ about regulations \u2013 because lawyers and so on are a huge investment for\
    \ a very early idea. So accelerated programs really helped us a lot. Then, we\
    \ found two or three big players that said, \u201CYeah, data (or AI, or technology)\
    \ is definitely one of the future things. Why don\u2019t you create a prototype\
    \ first?\u201D So we started in the AR area together with two or three brands."
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Maria
- line: "First, we created an AR filter, and just did a quick MVP to collect some\
    \ data. We came to a fair with these things. It was a lipstick try-on \u2013 very\
    \ rough, but very innovative at that time. We were so proud because that was one\
    \ of the first try-on on Instagram that was ever published. We just had a lot\
    \ of people using it on Instagram, but also at the fair. So we collected tons\
    \ of data. But at that time, we didn't even know what it was worth, nor what we\
    \ could learn from it."
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Maria
- line: "Then we took the second half of the time to make these things first, understandable,\
    \ \u201COkay, what kind of data do we have now? What can we learn from it?\u201D\
    \ And then we discussed that back with the partners to see, \u201COkay, what does\
    \ it say for possible solutions?\u201D At that point, we stopped doing AR for\
    \ a reason, because this is what we learned out of it. But it was a perfect, very\
    \ easy entry for us \u2013 a gamification entry to collect first data and first\
    \ users at the beginning."
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Maria
- line: Maybe this is a stupid question, but how is a lipstick try-on app connected
    to healthcare?
  sec: 939
  time: '15:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. What you do when you try on lipstick is a sequence \u2013 it could\
    \ be a picture or video of your whole face. So what we got out of that was not\
    \ really about... We, of course, saw how lipstick fits you in terms of color,\
    \ but we also saw the issues on the skin. We recognized, for example, that 80%\
    \ of people didn't know their type of skin at this time. So that was a huge educational\
    \ moment. We also understood, for example, the health issues people have on their\
    \ skin that we can recognize. So things were already changing early in this short\
    \ sequence. We saw, \u201COkay, it's nice to know which color of lipstick fits\
    \ you. But honestly, what we see is much more about the status quo of your health\
    \ from your skin.\u201D"
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Maria
- line: "That was the moment we realized, \u201COkay, there's much more we can do\
    \ with the data.\u201D Of course, we didn't have the algorithms then to do anything\
    \ but that was so much that we got out of it. There was so much more to explore\
    \ and this was definitely a more interesting market than focusing on just lipstick\
    \ or makeup. But it was a perfect entry point to get connected to people and users.\
    \ Because I think you can have a very good technology but if people don't have\
    \ fun using it, or don't see a benefit in using it, why should they do so? When\
    \ you tell people, \u201CLet's do a health check,\u201D for most people it's like,\
    \ \u201CUgh, I don't like it. I don't even like to go to a doctor. I don't want\
    \ to talk about that.\u201D But every woman\u2026 [cross-talk]"
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Maria
- line: But if you just use your phone to do the health check, that's a different
    thing.
  sec: 1053
  time: '17:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. Also, from the marketing perspective, it's much easier to get people\
    \ on board saying, \u201CHey, do you want to try out your next nice lipstick color?\u201D\
    \ For example, or, \u201CThe next eyebrow trend?\u201D People, and especially\
    \ women, think, \u201COh, that's nice. Before I buy it, I can try it.\u201D But\
    \ meanwhile, you can do so many more things and educate people about so much.\
    \ That's why we thought, \u201COkay, that was the second really big learning out\
    \ of that.\u201D The first was, \u201CThere's much more we can explore. There's\
    \ much more we can do from the technology perspective.\u201D And the second thing\
    \ was, \u201CIt was a very good entry, because people are very much likely to\
    \ discuss makeup and these kinds of lifestyle things.\u201D Yeah, it was a very\
    \ interesting time and that was our starting point."

- header: The importance of a plan B and being flexible
- line: "I'm just curious. For me, I see the connection \u2013 you take a picture,\
    \ or probably a stream of data, like a video, you try the lipstick and, at the\
    \ same time, you recognize that there are some skin problems on the face. Right?\
    \ [Maria agrees] How did you know that this is what you needed to do before you\
    \ did the lipstick app? Because you wanted to do the healthcare thing, yet you\
    \ created a lipstick app. Then, with the lipstick app, you collected a lot of\
    \ data and then you started [the healthcare part]. Did you do this on purpose\
    \ because you knew that while you try on lipstick, you see other areas of the\
    \ face?"
  sec: 1107
  time: '18:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Definitely not. I mean, that was what we learned out of that. As founder,\
    \ you probably also know that \u2013 you have a plan, but most of the time, you\
    \ have to go to Plan B or Plan C. When we started having discussions with all\
    \ these players of the market, we were lucky enough to find some that said \u201C\
    Okay, here's a budget for you to do something,\u201D or, \u201CHere are the resources\
    \ we could provide,\u201D or, \u201CWe could do the marketing campaign together,\
    \ if you do this and that.\u201D So it was a little bit of an opportunity to decide,\
    \ \u201COkay, let's give it a try.\u201D I mean, at least there are no investors\
    \ or no one saying or forcing us to do specifically these things or those things.\
    \ It was really more about learning about the market, technologies, etc."
  sec: 1149
  time: '19:09'
  who: Maria
- line: "Also, AR was, at that time, a very new, very hard thing, so it was a lot\
    \ of fun getting to know all these developers and AR haps and all these experts\
    \ to see what is possible already. Imagine, now we are using filters on Instagram\
    \ and TikTok every single day, but at this time, it was really, really new. For\
    \ us, it was like an opportunity \u2013 we went on a path, and we were lucky that\
    \ at the end of the path, we came back to the initial idea. This is what I always\
    \ say to other founders I meet, \u201COf course, you have a plan, but you cannot\
    \ always get stuck on a plan. You have to also be kind of flexible.\u201D Because\
    \ who knows if plan A is going to work? Yeah \u2013 follow the path."
  sec: 1149
  time: '19:09'
  who: Maria
- line: "For you, it was an opportunity to experiment with AI technologies \u2013\
    \ VR (virtual reality/augmented reality) and with these sorts of things. You could\
    \ experiment and you had some sort of budget to do that, so you thought, \u201C\
    Okay, let's just do a lipstick app.\u201D Then with that\u2026 Because I immediately\
    \ see how it can generate attention. Even with these stupid apps \u2013 I remember\

    \ are non-technical, so [the investors] were kind of afraid. But that was easy\
    \ to handle. We onboarded a great CTO, we did the technology, everyone could test\
    \ it, so it was approved. I mean, it was not that easy, but at the end of the\
    \ day, these were the milestones. The second thing was that what I already mentioned\
    \ \u2013 people don't really believe that healthcare solutions can be sustainable\
    \ from a business perspective, so that they can earn money. We understood that\
    \ we can also use AI in B2B projects. That was a changing point. We made clear\

    \ that you can earn money. Over the last months and years, that became very important\
    \ for them. I think nowadays, that's one of the main things you have to do as\
    \ a company or as a founder \u2013 you must really prove, \u201COkay, we have\
    \ the possibility to make money and not just a good idea. We don't need 100 million\
    \ to get the first money. We also have good business cases already here.\u201D\
    \ But honestly, [cross-talk] that's a tough way. I mean, you need to find first\
    \ customers who are willing to pay money, even if you're probably not ready with\

    \ He's there and he's part of it. He was there from the beginning. I think it's\
    \ the new generation and a new style of work we have. Of course, you have to be\
    \ concentrated. I'm not saying I can do everything at the same time, but you need\
    \ to be kind of flexible sometimes. Also, what works really well for me is to\
    \ structure my day. There are hours I really just spend with him and there are\
    \ hours when I definitely just work. It doesn't mean I'm working from eight to\
    \ four \u2013 it's more flexible in my case. Because I have to pick him up from\

    \ doing his things. He knows the procedure from the beginning. He's always telling\
    \ me \u201CMommy, it's our company, right?\u201D So he feels like he\u2019s part\
    \ of it. I think if you are relaxed, he or she is relaxed \u2013 you can handle\
    \ it. But it's definitely a balance you have to find, and you need people around\
    \ you to take care sometimes. I think the hardest part is to not be upset always\
    \ \u2013 not feeling that you cannot reach all for the company, you cannot reach\
    \ all for him. I think if you integrate things as both are part of me, that's\
