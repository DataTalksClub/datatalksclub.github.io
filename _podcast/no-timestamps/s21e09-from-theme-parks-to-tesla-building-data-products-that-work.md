    link in the live chat. Click on that link, ask your questions, and we will be
    covering these during the interview. Okay, that is the mandatory slides that we
    have before each interview.
  sec: 41
  time: 0:41
  who: Alexey
- line: Now I am opening the questions we prepared for you. And Abouzar, if you are
    ready, we can start.
  sec: 65
  time: '1:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, let’s do it.
  sec: 71
  time: '1:11'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Today on the podcast we are joined by Abouzar. He has worked on data and ML
    projects in very different places from amusement parks to e-commerce and now Tesla.
    We will talk about how to turn data into real products, what it means to productionize
    machine learning, and what is the future of data and ML engineering. So, welcome
    to our event.
  sec: 77
  time: '1:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. Happy to be here.
  sec: 95
  time: '1:35'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So, let’s start with your career journey so far. Can you tell us about this?
  sec: 101
  time: '1:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so my background is software engineering. I got my bachelor and master
    in software engineering, basically computer engineering, from Iran. Then I worked
    for a couple of years in a telecom company. After a while I thought, okay, this
    is getting boring.
  sec: 108
  time: '1:48'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Since you have to develop a lot of things and also support them, after a couple
    of years it becomes a lot of things to support. So I thought maybe it is time
    to go after something I like more. My master thesis was also on this same topic.
    It was machine learning, more like data science topics.
  sec: 126
  time: '2:06'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So I was just looking for different universities that had a similar program,
    where I could further study data science and understand it more. I came across
    a program in Eindhoven University that was called Professional Doctorate in Data
    Science. Now it is called Engineering Doctorate, they changed the name because
    of overlap issues. Yeah, I applied, when was it…
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Sorry, when was it? Was this 2018?
  sec: 193
  time: '3:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: 2018, yeah.
  sec: 199
  time: '3:19'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I was applying a little earlier, as we spoke before the interview. I was also
    considering Eindhoven University for my master’s, and I think the beginning of
    my career journey was quite similar. I was a software engineer, and I was getting
    bored, working at a bank, and I thought, do I really want to do this for the rest
    of my life?
  sec: 205
  time: '3:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Then I found out about machine learning, and I thought, oh, that is so cool.
    Eindhoven University was one of the universities I considered applying to. It
    is very interesting. I do not remember what it was called though, but I remember
    that university, and I really liked the program. In the end, I chose a different
    one.
  sec: 219
  time: '3:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. Which university did you go to?
  sec: 249
  time: '4:09'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So I graduated from TU Berlin. Oh, okay. And now I am in Berlin.
  sec: 254
  time: '4:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Nice, nice, nice. Yeah. So those years, I guess, it was like OpenAI just launched
    their thing. They started maybe two or three years before, and it was a hot topic,
    especially in the Netherlands and also in Germany. You could go around and see
    all the companies, and whether they were mature enough to use these models or
    not.
  sec: 259
  time: '4:19'
  who: Abouzar
- line: It was fun, I think. Fun years to start actually. So yeah, I started that
    program. It was a two-year program. It was not a PhD, but it was research plus
    practical work.
  sec: 288
  time: '4:48'
  who: Abouzar
- line: We call it doctorate. It is confusing, right?
  sec: 301
  time: '5:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it is confusing actually, but it is research plus practical work. They
    basically pay you to study. That was an amazing opportunity.
  sec: 308
  time: '5:08'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Ah, that is a good deal. I did not have this deal. What they offered me was
    a partial scholarship. Yeah, that was not enough.
  sec: 314
  time: '5:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, this was also like you get the minimum wage.
  sec: 326
  time: '5:26'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Yeah, that is really cool.
  sec: 332
  time: '5:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: That is awesome. It was enough, I think. For a student life it was enough.
    During that program, basically, you worked with a lot of Dutch companies that
    kind of sponsored the program.
  sec: 338
  time: '5:38'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Like Philips, ASML, and we worked with Hendricks Genetics, they were breeding
    turkeys and stuff. It was a lot of cool companies that you got to work with, even
    municipalities. A lot of companies actually worked very closely with TU Eindhoven.
    So it was really cool.
  sec: 345
  time: '5:45'
  who: Abouzar
- header: Moving to Europe for data science
- line: Then I went to Efteling, then to Bol.com, and now Tesla.
  sec: 377
  time: '6:17'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Okay. At the end, you said you went to… oh wait, after that you went to Efteling
    and then Bol.com. I have no knowledge about this link, but I see it is an amusement
    park. What is this? What did you do there? Because I also, sorry for interrupting
    you, I also worked at an amusement park.
  sec: 383
  time: '6:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was a ride operator. I let kids in and made sure they stayed safe. That
    was my job. I think yours was different, right?
  sec: 410
  time: '6:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: A bit different. So the story basically starts from my second year. In the
    second year of our program, we had to have a long project. For that one-year project
    I either had to go with the banks, in collaboration with the police, to work on
    money laundering. Because I did graph theory and a couple of projects like that,
    they thought maybe this was suitable.
  sec: 422
  time: '7:02'
  who: Abouzar
- line: The second option was to go to Efteling, the amusement park. I did not like
    the banking option, so I went with the second choice. At first, I was quite lost.
    I thought, what the hell am I doing here? How did I end up here? My background
    was technology and tech companies, and now I had landed in an amusement park.
  sec: 456
  time: '7:36'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So I started to understand what the problem there was that I could help with.
    You would be quite shocked when you land in an amusement park and think, what
    kind of data could they possibly have that I can design a model or train a model
    on? It started from there. Their main problem was crowd control.
  sec: 481
  time: '8:01'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I imagine this is like Disneyland, where you have many rides, and for each
    ride you stand in the queue, wait your turn, then ride for 5 seconds, and then
    it is done. At least that was my experience in Disneyland. Did you have a similar
    problem there?
  sec: 527
  time: '8:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. I think you know the business better than me because you were
    on the floor. Efteling is the biggest theme park in the Netherlands, and in terms
    of revenue maybe the second or third in Europe, after Europa Park and Disney.
  sec: 550
  time: '9:10'
  who: Abouzar
- line: It is very popular. In the Netherlands or in the part of Germany close to
    the Netherlands, everybody knows it. The significant thing about Efteling is that
    every ride has a story. Almost every ride has a story behind it.
  sec: 576
  time: '9:36'
  who: Abouzar
- line: It is not just a ride where you get scared or get an adrenaline rush. Everything
    has a story behind it. For example, a roller coaster is about a miner who got
    stuck there, or it was haunted. That was the cool part, and the thing that triggered
    me to think, who came up with this idea?
  sec: 598
  time: '9:58'
  who: Abouzar
- line: The most interesting and impactful part for me was learning about a guy called
    Peter Reinders. He was the mind behind creating the motors and movements, and
    putting mechanical stuff together to bring the magic to life without showing the
    technology. It was presented in a way that looked magical.
  sec: 633
  time: '10:33'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I found myself interested, not saying I am an innovator of the time, but he
    was a big Dutch innovator. He laid the foundation for all the innovations that
    you can see in the park. For example, in Efteling, Snow White is just laying there
    behind a window. Every kid sees her, and she is breathing.
  sec: 668
  time: '11:08'
  who: Abouzar
- line: That small detail of breathing adds magic when children watch her. These subtle
    details are really important, and it can be the same in our jobs as well. When
    presenting something, users do not need to know how complicated the backend is.
    It just needs to function well.
  sec: 708
  time: '11:48'
  who: Abouzar
- header: Working with theme parks and crowd modeling
- line: That is the story of all software engineers, right? You do not need to know
    how it works. But what did you do there? Did you do analytics and data science
    and machine learning?
  sec: 738
  time: '12:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. The problem was how they could control the crowd in different places
    in the park, or how they could drive groups of people to other places. Usually,
    people rushed to the roller coasters, but there were also story rides, family-friendly
    areas, and attractions for kids.
  sec: 752
  time: '12:32'
  who: Abouzar
- line: The goal was to create a recommendation system to plan their day and recommend
    their next move in order to avoid long waiting times. That was the ultimate goal,
    to improve the experience. Because if you go to an amusement park and all you
    do is spend time in queues, it is not fun.
  sec: 779
  time: '12:59'
  who: Abouzar
- line: In order to do that, we needed to predict how long the queue would be. You
    also needed to know the ride capacity. And you could also guess how crowded an
    area of the park would be based on data such as transactions at restaurants or
    stands selling drinks.
  sec: 816
  time: '13:36'
  who: Abouzar
- line: We had a couple of models. One came from transactions, others came from the
    rides. These gave us an index of how crowded each place was. We used that in another
    model that tried to predict and recommend the next best move for each group.
  sec: 849
  time: '14:09'
  who: Abouzar
- line: From the user point of view, did they have an app, and it said “go here now,
    go there next”? And then this way you redistribute the crowd so they do not all
    stand in one queue?
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly.
  sec: 890
  time: '14:50'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Efteling had a very popular app. I think back then at least 60 percent of
    the people used the app.
  sec: 895
  time: '14:55'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Makes sense. Especially if you advertise it like “do you want to wait less?
    Download our app,” then of course everyone says yes.
  sec: 900
  time: '15:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: We gave another incentive. When we wanted everybody to do the survey, we told
    them “do you want a free coffee?” Then they installed the app, did the survey,
    and got their free coffee at the start.
  sec: 906
  time: '15:06'
  who: Abouzar
- line: What you are describing reminds me of one of the classes I had in my bachelor
    studies, a modeling class. I do not remember the tools, I think it was SPSS Modeler.
    We modeled supermarkets, where people came at random times to cashiers, and we
    wanted to see what was the most effective way of dealing with customers.
  sec: 930
  time: '15:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: We tried different arrangements for cashiers. What worked best was having
    one queue for all the cashiers. Then each person went to whichever cashier opened
    next. That worked best in our modeling. Did you use a similar approach? Or was
    it something completely different?
  sec: 955
  time: '15:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually what we did was a bit different. From the survey, about 3,000 people
    participated and we got all the moves they made through the day. That was cool.
    We had a bit less than 3,000 variations of routes people would take, based on
    their preferences.
  sec: 1000
  time: '16:40'
  who: Abouzar
- line: For example, a group of two could specify in the app if they had lunch or
    not, whether they were daredevils or just wanted a chill day. So we had all these
    variations for each group of people, and we built a model based on that. If you
    gave your preference, the model would place you close to one of these variations.
  sec: 1040
  time: '17:20'
  who: Abouzar
- line: It gave a probability for a list of attractions you could take. On the app
    we showed the first suggestion, the one with the highest probability. It was simple
    but effective.
  sec: 1070
  time: '17:50'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Yes, like many things, the simplest solution often works really well.
  sec: 1091
  time: '18:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, especially since you do not know who is going to the park. It could be
    a 15-year-old or a 60-year-old not familiar with technology.
  sec: 1096
  time: '18:16'
  who: Abouzar
- header: Lessons from ride and visitor data
- line: Then you worked at Bol. I do not live in the Netherlands, but I know about
    Bol. First, I know because people from there often attend Berlin Buzzwords. I
    do not know if you ever went, but Berlin Buzzwords is a conference in Berlin about
    search and other hot topics like machine learning. This year it was AI, but typically
    search.
  sec: 1109
  time: '18:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: People from Bol came every year to Berlin Buzzwords, giving talks about the
    challenges they solved. That is how I knew about Bol. It is a big company, kind
    of like Dutch Amazon, and they started with books and now sell other things as
    well.
  sec: 1139
  time: '18:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, they started exactly like Amazon, selling books, but now it is everything.
  sec: 1155
  time: '19:15'
  who: Abouzar
- line: And you worked there. What did you work on?
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I worked specifically on the favorite brand carousel you could see in the
    app and on the webshop website. That was my biggest product there. Users could
    browse their favorite brands.
  sec: 1168
  time: '19:28'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Back then there was a big push from managers to integrate brands into websites
    and apps. The algorithm basically showed what was the favorite brand at the moment
    and whether it was related to you.
  sec: 1195
  time: '19:55'
  who: Abouzar
- line: And brands could be book-related? Like if I read books then my favorite brands
    could be publishers?
  sec: 1221
  time: '20:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Kind of, yes. But it could be anything.
  sec: 1232
  time: '20:32'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Like Nike, right?
  sec: 1237
  time: '20:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it could be a clothing brand, book brand, publisher, or anything. That
    was my biggest project, though I also did smaller things.
  sec: 1239
  time: '20:39'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I just open Bol and I see, well, first of all, everything is in Dutch. But
    since I speak German, it is kind of understandable for me. I see watches, coffee
    machines, washing machines, smartphones, lamps, furniture, basically everything.
  sec: 1251
  time: '20:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: So yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it has everything.
  sec: 1270
  time: '21:10'
  who: Abouzar
- line: The film, stools. Okay. So that is why, like let’s say if we talk about clothes,
    it could be Nikes or Adidases, right?
  sec: 1276
  time: '21:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Exactly. So it could be more related to what you purchased before, but
    also it has an element of how popular the brand is. Because maybe you bought a
    screen protector for your phone, but it is not your favorite brand, although it
    is popular. It is not really your favorite.
  sec: 1290
  time: '21:30'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Favorite is more in the realm of sociology. It is where you would really spend
    money without caring about how much you spend. Apple is an example of that because
    it has a strong fan base. People buy without thinking about the cost, since it
    is a perception of value.
  sec: 1316
  time: '21:56'
  who: Abouzar
- line: But let’s say I like Nikes because they are really comfortable. If Nike increases
    the price, I might think, yeah, maybe I check these other ones. Does that mean
    it is still my favorite brand or not?
  sec: 1344
  time: '22:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it then again depends.
  sec: 1354
  time: '22:34'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Like when it comes to shoes, I would prefer Nike because I know when I wear
    the sneakers, they just fit my feet.
  sec: 1359
  time: '22:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. What counts as favorite is probably also behavioral. You will maybe
    check trends from Nike, check their latest releases, or you favorited them.
  sec: 1366
  time: '22:46'
  who: Abouzar
- header: Building recommendation systems at Efteling
- line: I do not do any of these things. If I need shoes, I just go check what models
    are available. Usually, I go with the same model. But what I really hate is that
    they retire models. The model I like, I want to buy, but it is no longer available.
    I am like okay, what do I do now?
  sec: 1386
  time: '23:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it happens to me as well. I think Zalando does it best in that category.
    It has a really nice way of showing similar products, probably with a good model
    in the background. They present alternatives very well.
  sec: 1409
  time: '23:29'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I think at Bol we also had a similar products carousel. But Zalando is doing
    really well in terms of exploring similar products.
  sec: 1430
  time: '23:50'
  who: Abouzar
- line: And since you worked in recommender systems, was it something simple or more
    complex, like neural networks?
  sec: 1443
  time: '24:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think the biggest challenge in recommendation systems is how do you validate
    them, really?
  sec: 1456
  time: '24:16'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Yeah. Right. A/B tests, or what was it?
  sec: 1463
  time: '24:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Then A/B test is also biased depending on how you define the A/B test.
    The real performance is challenging, because how do you say, how much did I sell
    from the recommendations, or how many clicks did I get from the recommendations
    I showed?
  sec: 1471
  time: '24:31'
  who: Abouzar
- line: But then again, was it really what the users wanted? Or could we have done
    better? So validation is tricky. One interesting thing about the favorite brand
    project was that we thought about this problem and asked, how can we test it?
    So we created something like a swiping game.
  sec: 1489
  time: '24:49'
  who: Abouzar
- line: We showed this swiping thing to all the employees involved. That is how we
    tested the algorithm, and we were convinced it worked. Then we released it. Maybe
    I can share this. Yeah, okay, I hope you can see my screen.
  sec: 1515
  time: '25:15'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Yeah. But we will release this as audio only. So if you could also describe
    what is happening on the screen, that would be helpful.
  sec: 1542
  time: '25:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can see my screen.
  sec: 1548
  time: '25:48'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Yeah. Yeah, it’s loading.
  sec: 1553
  time: '25:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. We tried to make it fun by adding Star Wars loading gifs and things
    like that, so it would not be boring. Before the employees saw this page, we did
    streaming processes because we did not want to process three million or six million
    users.
  sec: 1561
  time: '26:01'
  who: Abouzar
- line: We just wanted to do it for the employees, otherwise it would be costly. And
    we did not know which users were employees, so we had to do calculations on the
    fly just before they saw the page. And it took like 45.
  sec: 1575
  time: '26:15'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So the experience for the users was that they go to the website, and if they
    are employees, then they see this?
  sec: 1589
  time: '26:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was an internal website. Yeah. So we did all the processing there, and
    they could easily say, okay, this is my favorite brand, or what you are showing
    me is not my favorite.
  sec: 1601
  time: '26:41'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So right now, can you describe what you show? Like, do you want to see Stabilo,
    Ubisoft?
  sec: 1613
  time: '26:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. For example, on a card we had three buttons that said, it is not
    my favorite, I like it, or this is my favorite brand.
  sec: 1620
  time: '27:00'
  who: Abouzar
- line: It seems very random. Stabilo creates markers, Ubisoft is a game software
    company, Xiaomi produces what? They produce phones and wearable devices, right?
  sec: 1631
  time: '27:11'
  who: Alexey
- header: Joining Bol.com and the Dutch e-commerce industry
- line: Yeah. But your way of buying stuff is not just books from Bol. You usually
    buy a wider variety.
  sec: 1646
  time: '27:26'
  who: Abouzar
- line: But like if I need markers and I see Stabilo, I will go with Stabilo. I do
    not know how to pronounce it exactly, but I know they are good. If there are brands
    I do not know, I will just go with Stabilo.
  sec: 1663
  time: '27:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Basically, you want to see the perception about the brand. Or even if
    people know the brand. For example, 999 Games, this is a board game company. If
    you are into board games, you obviously know them.
  sec: 1680
  time: '28:00'
  who: Abouzar
- line: If you like Lego and things like that, you would swipe right for them. Employees
    swiped left or right for individual brands, and we could see if our favorite brand
    algorithm worked for them or not.
  sec: 1699
  time: '28:19'
  who: Abouzar
- line: There is a comment from Adonis. Hi Adonis, by the way. He says it looks like
    Tinder for brands.
  sec: 1717
  time: '28:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 1720
  time: '28:40'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I guess we all know where you got the inspiration from. So that was the approach,
    but how did it… So I worked at a similar company. It was not e-commerce, it was
    an online marketplace, but the idea is similar.
  sec: 1723
  time: '28:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: You have items, you have people to recommend them to, and you develop a recommender
    system. You already have a basic recommender, then you improve it. You split traffic
    into test and control groups, one sees the new algorithm, the other the old one.
  sec: 1739
  time: '28:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Then you check metrics. In our case it was conversions. For that company,
    conversion meant when people wrote to each other. For example, on a marketplace
    site like Marktplaats in the Netherlands, you want to buy a loudspeaker, you write
    to the seller, that counts as conversion.
  sec: 1769
  time: '29:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: We measured if in the test group there were more conversions than in the control
    group. If so, the new algorithm was good and we rolled it out. So that is the
    basic A/B test. Why did you need to do this Tinder for brands instead of the usual
    way?
  sec: 1807
  time: '30:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Because there was nothing similar before.
  sec: 1831
  time: '30:31'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Okay. So your control group would be nothing, and the test group would be
    this new system?
  sec: 1837
  time: '30:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, basically. Or we could have also aggregated purchases or views by brand
    and then shown random items to test against this one. That could have been done
    too. But this was really about convincing our team that this could work.
  sec: 1843
  time: '30:43'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Makes sense. It gave you internal agreement that the idea was worth investing
    in, so you could spend a quarter or so developing it.
  sec: 1868
  time: '31:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did you use the results? Swiping is fun, but at the end, what was the
    outcome?
  sec: 1879
  time: '31:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Basically, we measured how accurate we were at showing the brands. A couple
    of items in the list were not actually their favorite brand. At the end, we could
    say that about 85 percent of the items swiped were actually their favorites.
  sec: 1899
  time: '31:39'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I see. So the algorithm already knew their likely favorites, like Lego, Nike,
    Xiaomi. Then you added three more brands that were not in the algorithm’s output.
    Ideally the users would swipe the recommended ones as favorites and the extra
    ones as not favorites.
  sec: 1917
  time: '31:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That is how we validated it again, showing the model worked, before
    releasing it as something brand new.
  sec: 1955
  time: '32:35'
  who: Abouzar
- header: Product and brand recommendation logic
- line: And for the user, they see a brand, click, and can buy stuff from it, right?
  sec: 1969
  time: '32:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Exactly. The purpose of this component was that they clicked the brand
    and saw featured or popular products from that brand. Engagement with brands on
    Bol would go higher. That was the point.
  sec: 1982
  time: '33:02'
  who: Abouzar
- line: What do you do now?
  sec: 1995
  time: '33:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Currently, I work as a data engineer at Tesla.
  sec: 2001
  time: '33:21'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Sorry, at Bol you worked as an ML engineer or as a data engineer?
  sec: 2007
  time: '33:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: So I did both actually. I did data science plus data engineering. When I went
    there it was like okay, we have this project, and I was interested to work on
    it. That was it.
  sec: 2015
  time: '33:35'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I think that mix comes from my background. You never fully transition. You
    carry your background with you. I have a software engineering background, that
    is the story of my life. Whether you want it or not, you bring interests from
    your previous work and involve them.
  sec: 2035
  time: '33:55'
  who: Abouzar
- line: That was the same for me. At Efteling with the survey app, I wrote the Android
    app even though I was the data scientist. It helped data collection. I pick up
    those tasks because I am also interested in machine learning, and I like deploying
    and training models.
  sec: 2061
  time: '34:21'
  who: Abouzar
- line: But you need to really understand if it will help, or if you are just making
    it complicated for nothing. If it helps, I will do it.
  sec: 2088
  time: '34:48'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So the idea is, even though you are a data engineer, you can do pretty much
    everything needed.
  sec: 2116
  time: '35:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. At Tesla that is the case. It is very hands-on, and you just create
    stuff that is functional without worrying about making it fancy. Maybe in other
    software companies it is different, but I also want to state that I am not speaking
    on behalf of Tesla.
  sec: 2124
  time: '35:24'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Yes, that is important. But can you actually talk about the things you do
    at work?
  sec: 2147
  time: '35:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not so much to be honest. I can generally talk about who I am and my background,
    but I cannot talk about projects at Tesla in detail.
  sec: 2154
  time: '35:54'
  who: Abouzar
- header: Experimenting with "Tinder for brands"
- line: What is interesting is your mix of skills. For me it was similar. My first
    job as a data scientist, I was hired because I knew Java. I was a software engineer
    working with Java, and even though I had done my master’s, they only cared about
    my Java.
  sec: 2169
  time: '36:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: The data scientists there used R and Python but did not want to touch Java.
    So they needed someone who knew it, and I did.
  sec: 2203
  time: '36:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that is exactly how it is, I think. Sometimes when fields advance, they
    diverge. At first there is just software engineering, then it becomes backend,
    frontend, DevOps. Later it can come back together again.
  sec: 2209
  time: '36:49'
  who: Abouzar
- line: For data scientists, if you do not know deployment, or you only know statistical
    methods but cannot transform data, is that enough? I think you need to know all
    of these together.
  sec: 2242
  time: '37:22'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So when I asked what you do now, you said data engineer. Do you identify as
    data engineering, or more of a generalist?
  sec: 2262
  time: '37:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think what I am best at is being a machine learning engineer. My day-to-day
    tasks are maybe 60 to 70 percent data engineering. The last 30 percent is software
    engineering, machine learning engineering, and some data science.
  sec: 2282
  time: '38:02'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So yeah, it depends on what my employer wants, to be honest.
  sec: 2303
  time: '38:23'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I understand. For me, when I was a data scientist, the issue was that many
    data scientists were not good at deploying models, and they did not want to do
    it. Because of my background, I could fill that gap. For example, I did not know
    Kubernetes before my job, but I learned it because the team needed someone.
  sec: 2311
  time: '38:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sometimes data scientists cannot always pick these things up. But you said
    you just do what the employer needs. How does that work in practice? There are
    some things you want to do but cannot, and some things you do not want to do but
    still need to. How do you balance that? How do you prove yourself so you get more
    responsibilities?
  sec: 2359
  time: '39:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that is a good question. I do not know the exact answer. Sometimes you
    need to get yourself out of the trap. You might think, I do not need to do this
    dashboard, but then see that it is actually an opportunity.
  sec: 2407
  time: '40:07'
  who: Abouzar
- header: Engagement metrics and product validation
- line: Opportunities are things other people might not see, but you do. Then you
    feel obliged to take it. You can do the standard solution, like solving with a
    script, or you can say, no, a model will improve it a lot. That is how it works
    for me.
  sec: 2426
  time: '40:26'
  who: Abouzar
- line: If I see there is an opportunity to improve something exponentially, I try
    to do it. Of course, there are boundaries. You need to look at your time and resources.
    But most of the time, it is about underpromising and overdelivering.
  sec: 2458
  time: '40:58'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So, okay, that is a good approach, right? Because if you overpromise and underdeliver,
    it is way worse.
  sec: 2479
  time: '41:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: That is way worse. But it takes a lot of effort. It takes a lot of energy
    from you. Yes.
  sec: 2485
  time: '41:25'
  who: Abouzar
- line: And you are still doing some machine learning, right?
  sec: 2496
  time: '41:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I always engage myself with that, and now with LLM agents and all those
    things being used across companies, including Tesla. It is a nice opportunity
    to improve your tasks as well as the platforms you are providing for colleagues.
    It is great. I think it is a great time to be in the field.
  sec: 2503
  time: '41:43'
  who: Abouzar
- line: You have been in the industry for quite some time, so you also saw this rise
    of LLMs and AI in recent years. How did your work change with that? Now the challenges
    are different. The models we deploy, especially LLMs, come with their own issues.
    What are these challenges for you, and how do you deal with them?
  sec: 2528
  time: '42:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think first it drastically changes things. Sometimes I am shocked, like
    wow, this task would have taken me four days, but I can now solve it in a couple
    of hours. Especially for developers, that is amazing. The pitfall is when everybody
    starts thinking AI can solve everything.
  sec: 2554
  time: '42:34'
  who: Abouzar
- header: From ML engineering to data engineering roles
- line: Are you talking about using AI for creating code, or using models to solve
    the problems themselves?
  sec: 2582
  time: '43:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think mostly creating code.
  sec: 2595
  time: '43:15'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Okay, so coding. The correct way to say it is AI-assisted development, right?
  sec: 2600
  time: '43:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. But I like web coding more.
  sec: 2605
  time: '43:25'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Web coding means you just let whatever code is produced get shipped. And then
    sometimes it drops your database, and you are like, oops.
  sec: 2612
  time: '43:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not that. AI-assisted development is different.
  sec: 2624
  time: '43:44'
  who: Abouzar
- line: At least this is how I understand it. Web coding is something that kind of
    works, but you do not care what is inside.
  sec: 2629
  time: '43:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, true. But it can help you develop code, refactor, and handle documentation.
    To be honest, the most significant usage that LLMs have is really in these areas.
  sec: 2635
  time: '43:55'
  who: Abouzar
- line: For me, I use them for coding but also for editing and writing texts. This
    is how I started using them more than two years ago when GPT appeared. Back then
    it was not that useful for coding since GPT-3.5 would produce code that did not
    always work.
  sec: 2658
  time: '44:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Now with today’s models you can go to platforms like Replit or Lovable. You
    just say, “I want to build an application where I can swipe brands left and right
    and see which one I like,” and a few minutes later the app is deployed.
  sec: 2687
  time: '44:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I saw that. I have my opinions about it. I think it is hard to believe
    sometimes. To me, the biggest advancement would be physical AI. But I agree with
    Yann LeCun from Meta who said maybe AGI will not just come from LLMs.
  sec: 2734
  time: '45:34'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Yes, because you also need hardware, physical components. For example, cars
    need to make driving decisions. This is where AI could be useful. Hypothetically,
    since self-hosting LLMs is much more complex than before, did you find any helpful
    tools?
  sec: 2766
  time: '46:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: For inference, yes. On weekends I work on these projects. Some vision-language
    models are optimized enough that you can run inference on a Raspberry Pi, though
    it is slow. I also saw Nvidia Orin as a development kit optimized for inference.
    Even Mac Minis are amazing for this.
  sec: 2825
  time: '47:05'
  who: Abouzar
- line: There are projects where you can cluster them together and get really good
    performance in tokens per second. Hardware is catching up, and I think it will
    only get easier in the future.
  sec: 2875
  time: '47:55'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I checked Nvidia Jetson Orin and it costs around 2000. A little more expensive
    than Raspberry Pi.
  sec: 2901
  time: '48:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Really? I thought it was around 700.
  sec: 2908
  time: '48:28'
  who: Abouzar
- line: There is another version, Jetson Nano Orin, which has 8 GB instead of 64 GB,
    costing around 350. Still more expensive than a Raspberry Pi. But when you said
    you were deploying LLMs on Raspberry Pi, I was impressed.
  sec: 2913
  time: '48:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: That is useful if you have a small team of maybe five developers. You do not
    want to pay 200 euros per month per user. Instead, you deploy one model on an
    Orin device that they all query occasionally. It works.
  sec: 2933
  time: '48:53'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Yes, because 8 GB is enough for some smaller LLMs, like those recent Chinese
    models.
  sec: 2965
  time: '49:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, especially specialized models for coding. You can put that in and handle
    coding questions. It can bring costs down for startups.
  sec: 2978
  time: '49:38'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Do you know any models like that?
  sec: 2993
  time: '49:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think the 2.7 billion parameter LLaMa model is working well. There are others
    too like Gro, and cloud ones are amazing, but for open source, LLaMa is good.
  sec: 2999
  time: '49:59'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Do you need to fine-tune them for coding, or are some already pre-trained
    for that?
  sec: 3011
  time: '50:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think Gemini and others have code-specific versions. Replicate is a good
    place to check these.
  sec: 3035

  sec: 3063
  time: '51:03'

    a wide range of models for video, photos, and more.

  who: Alexey
- header: Hands-on skills at Tesla and industry expectations
- line: Hi Donis, I know him, he was my classmate. I think finding a north star was
    key. For me, I was very motivated to work for Tesla, a company with vision. A
    vision that drives both the technology and the business is inspiring.
  sec: 3124
  time: '52:04'
  who: Abouzar

    seem impossible. That had a great impact on me.
  sec: 3154
  time: '52:34'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I also think about impact at this point in life. Earlier, I would just code
    all day, but now I think about who I can impact and where my contribution makes
    sense. That shaped my career choices.
  sec: 3205
  time: '53:25'
  who: Abouzar

  sec: 3243

  sec: 3250

  who: Abouzar
- line: How did you prepare? What did you need to know for the job?
  sec: 3255
  time: '54:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: You do not know exactly what they will ask. I looked for other people’s interview
    experiences and questions. I printed a list of what data engineers should know
    and studied everything, like distributed systems. That is how I prepared.
  sec: 3262
  time: '54:22'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I asked GPT to generate Tesla data engineering questions. Back then ChatGPT
    had limitations though. How long have you been working at Tesla?
  sec: 3329
  time: '55:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Almost two years.
  sec: 3347
  time: '55:47'
  who: Abouzar
- line: Back then it could not search the internet. But it suggested SQL, scripting,
    ETL, architecture, behavioral questions. Was coding emphasized, like LeetCode?
  sec: 3352
  time: '55:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not much. That is more of a Google thing, not here.
  sec: 3378
  time: '56:18'
  who: Abouzar
- line: So it was more system design and architecture questions?
  sec: 3384

  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, mostly architecture, scripting, and those things.
  sec: 3389
  time: '56:29'
  who: Abouzar

    and store it for analysis. There is already so much to talk about in such a question.
  sec: 3398
  time: '56:38'
  who: Alexey
- header: Career growth, learning, and advice

    you take it. But you also have everyday tasks. How do you prioritize?
  sec: 3463

  who: Alexey
- line: What do you mean by opportunity?
  sec: 3470
  time: '57:50'
  who: Abouzar
- line: We were talking about tasks as a data engineer. You also sometimes expand
    into things like Kubernetes, like I did. I see these as opportunities, but they
    compete with routine tasks. How do you prioritize those improvements?
  sec: 3478
  time: '57:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: It goes back to underpromising and overdelivering. You put in more effort,
    maybe even in your free time, to deliver results that can really improve things.
    Sometimes it takes personal time, but the outcome is worth it.
  sec: 3539
  time: '58:59'
  who: Abouzar
- line: I like that answer. Underpromise and overdeliver. You create a buffer, and
    when it works out, it looks great.
  sec: 3577
  time: '59:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. It is not about the minimum. It is about something acceptable,
    plus delivering more than expected. That is how it usually works for me.
