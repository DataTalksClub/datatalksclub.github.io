title: 'Actionable Biohacks to Boost Productivity: Sleep, Circadian Light, Dopamine
  & Habits'
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about biohacking and improving productivity. We have
    a special guest today, Ruslan. Ruslan is a data scientist who lives in Berlin.
    He has tried a lot of healthy and not-so-healthy things to stay focused and productive.
    Eventually, he found a bunch of techniques, protocols, concepts about our brain,
    body, and mind that might be helpful to others in the data community. And today
    we will talk about all these things that he discovered. By the way, Ruslan is
    looking for a job, so if you need an awesome data scientist to join your team,
    you can find him on LinkedIn. I will also add his contact details in the show
    notes. Welcome to the show, Ruslan.

  time: '1:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you so much. I'm very excited to be here.
  sec: 127
  time: '2:07'
  who: Ruslan
- line: And we're excited to have you here today too. The questions for today's interview
    were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, as always for your help.
  sec: 131
  time: '2:11'
  who: Alexey
- header: Ruslan’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of biohacking, let's start with your background.
    Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 138
  time: '2:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. After high school, I went to study international business management.
    Then I moved to Berlin and finished my Bachelor’s in this field and did marketing.
    I worked in several SaaS companies afterwards, related to marketing. It was more
    of the business side of things, so I was talking to clients. And I was just very
    bored. Then I realized that I want to do something more exciting for me and I
    went for my Master’s.
  sec: 147
  time: '2:27'
  who: Ruslan
- line: In my Master's, I studied business intelligence and process management, and
    I did some data science projects. I completely fell in love with the topic. After
    these projects, I realized I want to pursue a career in data science and deal
    with machine learning models, help businesses make data-driven decisions and make
    the world a little bit better through this. That's how I got into data science.
  sec: 147
  time: '2:27'
  who: Ruslan
- line: I first landed an internship at OLX and then I have been working there as
    a data scientist as well. I also did my Master’s thesis about deep learning. So
    it's a topic very dear to my heart, as much as productivity and all the stuff
    I'm going to talk about.
  sec: 147
  time: '2:27'
  who: Ruslan
- line: When did you discover this topic of biohacking and productivity? Was it during
    your Bachelor’s degree years or later, or when you already were into data science?
  sec: 218
  time: '3:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, I've been interested in that for a long time. I just didn't know
    that it was called biohacking until recently. But I was always researching about
    some productivity tips or mental models and frameworks – how you can organize
    your time – because I was one of those students who didn't study much during the
    normal study times. I would write the papers just before the deadline and prepare
    for the exam on the last day. I was always thinking… [cross-talk]
  sec: 231
  time: '3:51'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Like every one of us. [chuckles] Most people, at least.
  sec: 256
  time: '4:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, like so many of us. [chuckles] And I thought to myself after another
    deadline, “I wish that next time, I would actually properly prepare.” And then
    I thought, “How do I trick my brain into doing this? What are the habits that
    I should have in order to do this?” That's how I got into this topic. Then it
    turned out that it's not just about mental models, but also your health and some
    protocols you can use to just help you in doing the work you want to do in the
    best way possible for you.
  sec: 258
  time: '4:18'
  who: Ruslan
- header: Fighting procrastination and perfectionism
- line: So what are these habits that helped you during your studying and then later
    on? Not postponing everything until the last minute? [chuckles]
  sec: 291
  time: '4:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Postponing some stuff until the last minute. I mean, I realized that I mostly
    postponed stuff because I understood that the solution I'm going to create is
    not perfect. If it's not perfect, it doesn't really make sense to start it, right?
    Then once the deadline approaches, you just realize that you have to do it. Then
    the perfectionism goes away and you just do it. I just learned to work around
    it, to be honest.
  sec: 302
  time: '5:02'
  who: Ruslan
- line: I realized that if I'm starting a project and I am not happy about particular
    things that are challenging things, then I just need to give myself some time
    to think about it and then accept parts of it that are not perfect. Then I feel
    that I'm unblocked and I can just go on and work on it. That's kind of my ultimate
    hack for solving procrastination, for example.
  sec: 302
  time: '5:02'
  who: Ruslan
- line: So one thing is having deadlines – doing things almost at the last minute
    because it helps you to fight perfectionism. Then the other thing is just accepting
    that it will never be perfect and then you have to do it. [Ruslan agrees] Is there
    more to that or just these two things? Should we finish our episode now? [laughs]
  sec: 352
  time: '5:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, no. That's generally about procrastination, but procrastination is not
    the only thing that I was trying to solve with biohacking. For me, it's also about
    how to stay consistent in learning some things that don't have deadlines, for
    example. Or even if there is a deadline and you need to focus very intensely on
    a subject, how do you do that? How can you help yourself to do it? Also, procrastinating
    and leaving everything to the last minute is very, very stressful and not healthy,
    so I wanted to understand how I can have a better, healthier lifestyle and actually
    work from my strengths to solve the tasks and do what I love. So that's how biohacking
    helped.
  sec: 372
  time: '6:12'
  who: Ruslan
- header: What is biohacking?
- line: How is biohacking different from typical productivity methods like having
    deadlines, or having a plan, or having things like that?
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: 7:05 Ruslan
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's a bit more grounded in science. Biohacking is actually just a
    term – it’s a buzzword. It can be explained in so many different ways, from genome
    editing to something simple like going for a walk or taking a break from the screen
    every half hour. The definition that you can give can be very different. The biohacking
    that I'm practicing is mostly behavioral. I don't take any special drugs or medicines,
    but only vitamins and stuff that helps you – things that don't affect your overall
    – let's call it a “chemical” state – very much. So without chemical intervention.
    And I found that just behavioral… [cross-talk]
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: So we will not talk about mushrooms today?
  sec: 471
  time: '7:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I'm not talking about that today. No. [chuckles] I mean, they are really
    a lot of extreme things that people can do. When I started doing it, I thought
    that for me, it should be behavioral so that I can create some habits that can
    help me. And it should be affordable. And it should be something very easy. The
    barrier to entry is very low, so anybody can try it out and see for themselves
    if it's helpful or not.
  sec: 473
  time: '7:53'
  who: Ruslan
- line: That's kind of my approach to biohacking. I thought in the beginning, it's
    also just productivity tips and tricks and just general knowledge about health
    and brain, but it turned out that this is a part of biohacking. It's very powerful
    and useful. That's how I got into it.
  sec: 473
  time: '7:53'
  who: Ruslan
- line: So taking breaks and going for a walk, are these considered biohacking in
    your definition?
  sec: 522
  time: '8:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think so. For example, going for a walk is related to dopamine production
    in our system. Dopamine is a hormone that basically drives the effort for us to
    do something. Dopamine is also a hormone that is related to motor movements. When
    we go for a walk, we literally produce dopamine that can later be used to help
    us to study and learn and work better. It is one of the ways to increase dopamine
    in the morning. It has some other great benefits like light consumption. It is
    biohacking, actually, if you do it in the right moments.
  sec: 530
  time: '8:50'
  who: Ruslan
- header: The role of dopamine and other hormones in daily life
- line: What is this dopamine? A few interviews ago, I spoke with my colleague Sadat
    who was describing his experience of going from an individual contributor software
    engineer to a manager. One of the things he mentioned there was that when he was
    an engineer he would often get what he referred to as “dopamine shots”. He solves
    a problem, he fixes a bug, and then he gets a shot of dopamine and feels good
    about it. But when he became a manager, the gratification he was getting was delayed
    because it's not him who was doing all these things but somebody else, and it
    was quite a difficult adjustment for him. Back then I didn't really ask him what
    dopamine is. But now I have a chance to ask you. So what is this? And how is it
    related to what he was talking about?
  sec: 571
  time: '9:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. First of all, I need to make a disclaimer that I am not a neuroscientist.
    I just use the general knowledge available, even though I try to be a bit more
    scientific about my research and conclusions and look for relevant sources. I
    will try to give you my definition and understanding of dopamine. We have different
    hormones in our brains that are responsible for different actions we do and dopamine
    is a hormone that is produced in our brain on a certain cadence, with a certain
    volume. It's basically responsible for us doing some stuff – us reaching a goal
    or going for a walk, it's responsible for motor movements in our body. That's
    what it does.
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Ruslan
- line: It's different compared to serotonin, for example, which is a hormone of happiness
    and feeling good inside of your body. If you take a bath, for example, and it's
    very nice. Or maybe you just ate some good food. Even though food increases dopamine,
    the good feeling you have in your stomach gives you serotonin. It's a bit opposite
    of dopamine because dopamine is something you need to do outside of your body.
    It’s something from the outside that gives you dopamine.
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Why does fixing a bug give you dopamine?
  sec: 694
  time: '11:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Because you solve a problem. It requires you to understand the problem, the
    journey takes, and then eventually you solve the bug, you solve the problem, your
    brain celebrates it, gives you more dopamine, and sets you up for fixing more
    bugs in the future. If you think about it, it's really grounded in basic things.
    You need to walk around as an organism to find some food. Right? If you find sugar,
    for example – we get a lot of dopamine from having sugar because sugar was not
    highly available for our ancestors. So that's why our brain currently rewards
    us a lot for eating sugary stuff. It's the same for doing some mental exercises
    as well, I think.
  sec: 698
  time: '11:38'
  who: Ruslan
- header: How meditation can help
- line: Interesting. Can you tell us about your journey into biohacking? During your
    university times, you were procrastinating and putting off things till the last
    moment, but then you realized that maybe it's not the best way of doing this.
    Then, at some point, you discovered biohacking. How did this happen and what exactly
    did you discover there? What kind of things did you try there and how did they
    help you?
  sec: 742
  time: '12:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I would say the first thing that I tried that was very influential for
    me was meditation. Meditation is a very good technique to stay focused and alert.
    It helps you to strengthen your prefrontal cortex, so you have better impulse
    control. [cross-talk]
  sec: 766
  time: '12:46'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Prefrontal what? Cortex?
  sec: 782
  time: '13:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it’s the part of your brain that is located in the front. So prefrontal
    means in front. It's related to cognition. Cognition is thinking, so all the high-level
    thinking that you have – not your primitive brain that wants to eat and sleep,
    but rather the brain that solves a bug or plans vacations.
  sec: 785
  time: '13:05'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Or talks right now, right? This is what we’re using now to communicate?
  sec: 810
  time: '13:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think so, yes.
  sec: 814
  time: '13:34'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Right now, at this moment.
  sec: 815
  time: '13:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. We have a prefrontal lobe that’s quite active nowadays.
  sec: 816
  time: '13:36'
  who: Ruslan
- line: It’s somewhere here, right? [Ruslan agrees] For those who are listening to
    this and don’t see, I'm touching my forehead.
  sec: 821
  time: '13:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So I started with meditation and that was very good. I had a lot of
    great feelings from it. When I talk about meditation, I’m mainly talking about
    sitting in the chair and breathing and counting from 1 to 10 to yourself and just
    feeling your body – this kind of meditative state. I'm not talking about any spiritual
    things, because I didn't really practice that. So that was one of the things that
    helped me a lot.
  sec: 831
  time: '13:51'
  who: Ruslan
- line: I just wanted to talk a bit about that. Did it not feel to you like a waste
    of time when you tried that? Because you're sitting in the chair and you're breathing
    and counting, but you could actually be working on things.
  sec: 861
  time: '14:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, the thing is – when I think about our bodies, I think that we're not
    made to function to solve bugs 24/7. We usually have our own cycles in life. Obviously,
    we go to sleep and then we wake up and we have a certain time when we are the
    most productive. Then our productivity gets lower a little bit, so we need to
    take breaks. There are sleep cycles of one and a half hours. We would fall asleep,
    and then we would wake up. These cycles continue as we go throughout the day.
    You cannot expect that you will be super hyper focused for three or five hours
    straight.
  sec: 877
  time: '14:37'
  who: Ruslan
- line: You need to take breaks. Usually, because social media is very addictive,
    we will take breaks on social media. But meditation is a very good, healthy way
    to take a break. It also helps with learning a lot, for example. Because when
    we are learning something, our brain changes – it's called neuroplasticity. The
    brain change actually happens when we sleep or when we meditate, for example.
    It's a protocol called non-sleep deep rest. This is exactly when the brain is
    changing. If you’re learning something, meditation is also very powerful.
  sec: 877
  time: '14:37'
  who: Ruslan
- line: How did you open your mind to try meditation? You just heard that it's good?
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I just heard from a lot of people that meditation is good and I followed
    some CEOs of some companies on Twitter that said, “Hey, meditation is very nice.
    You should try it out. And that's how I gave it a shot. I used different apps
    for guided meditation. The one that I use is open source and it's called Medito.
    It’s basically available for free. You can just download and use it. There is
    going to be a person with a nice voice telling you, “Close your eyes. Relax. Count
    from 1 to 10.” Stuff like that.
  sec: 956
  time: '15:56'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Usually it’s like 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes. I did an experiment when
    I was doing one hour meditation every single day for a month because another very
    famous investor Naval Ravikant suggested doing this. It was a very different type
    of meditation, though. But it was also very helpful.
  sec: 956
  time: '15:56'
  who: Ruslan
- line: How did you understand that it's helpful?
  sec: 1013
  time: '16:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, first of all, it's about awareness and being self-aware. We have so
    many thoughts and so many things happening with us nowadays. We have a complete
    information overflow. We hear so many things, see so many things in social media,
    basically. Having a break to just listen to yourself and trying to understand
    how you're feeling feels like a very big relief, even though it's uncomfortable
    in the beginning. It's not something we’re usually used to. In my experience,
    it really felt like a relief. Then you get out of the meditation and you feel
    relaxed. You feel like you took a break and now you can go back to doing whatever
    you want.
  sec: 1018
  time: '16:58'
  who: Ruslan
- line: You've been doing this for quite some time, right?
  sec: 1061
  time: '17:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I have on and off moments. Sometimes I'm doing it and sometimes I'm
    not doing it. I think it's also okay, because I don't want my productivity system
    to be punishing me for not doing something. I'm trying to listen to myself and
    see if I have the “resource” as they call it, for it right now. And if I don't,
    it's also fine. But when I'm studying a lot, like nowadays, for example, I meditate
    as well, because it helps.
  sec: 1063
  time: '17:43'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Because it's too much, right? You need to consume a lot of information, process
    a lot of information, so you need to give your mind a break.
  sec: 1090
  time: '18:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Some cognition happens while we're meditating anyways. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1099
  time: '18:19'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Cognition means learning, right?
  sec: 1107
  time: '18:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thinking. It's happening while we meditate as well, just in the background.
    We're not aware of it. And the brain makes sense of information we learned and
    updates the neural network.
  sec: 1108
  time: '18:28'
  who: Ruslan
- header: The influence light has on our bodies
- line: So you tried meditation. What did you try after that?
  sec: 1121
  time: '18:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: After meditation, there were a lot of topics that I've heard about, but I
    wasn't sure how scientific they are. For example, I tried…
  sec: 1125
  time: '18:45'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Was it important for you that the thing is scientific?
  sec: 1132
  time: '18:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, more or less. Well, I'm a data scientist and I've always been a fan
    of the scientific method. Everything we do should be verified, blindly controlled
    studies with some good experiments – with a scientific base. I wanted to do it
    not because of the placebo effect, although a placebo is a very powerful tool.
    This is maybe part of a mental attitude we can talk about. But I wanted to know
    that it actually helps somehow to reach your goals. I tried to find some information
    about meditation and I saw that it's indeed supported by studies. Reduces stress,
    helps you focus better, and you learn faster, and so on. And then I tried cold
    showers, for example. I'm not a big fan of it right now.
  sec: 1136
  time: '18:56'
  who: Ruslan
- line: It’s too cold now for cold showers. [chuckles]
  sec: 1185
  time: '19:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Too cold. [chuckles] Yeah. Then I also tried to have a proper approach with
    light, for example, which is something that not many people know about. When we
    wake up, we need to get a lot of light. And then when we go to bed, we should
    have very little light. I didn’t know about this protocol. I've heard about it
    on a podcast and I've been a big fan ever since. When we talk about health and
    biohacking, sleep is the foundation of everything. The podcast I'm talking about
    is called the Huberman Lab Podcast. There, Professor Huberman talks about light.
    He's a neuroscientist. He says that if people would ask him “What is the most
    important factor for productivity and for health across all domains?” He would
    say “It's light.” That kind of makes sense. We live on planet Earth and we have
    daily cycles, so our bodies, through evolution, adapted to the planet’s condition.
    We want to wake up with the sun and fall asleep when the sun is out.
  sec: 1190
  time: '19:50'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Does that mean that during the winter, we should go to sleep at three o'clock?
  sec: 1261
  time: '21:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's a good one. [chuckles] But no. It means we try to get more light – as
    much light as we can in the morning when we wake up, and just have little light
    before you go to bed.
  sec: 1264
  time: '21:04'
  who: Ruslan
- line: How do you do this? Are the regular light bulbs that we have in our homes
    sufficient for that? Or do we need to have some fancy setup?
  sec: 1278
  time: '21:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: The main principle behind this is that we need to get enough light into the
    eyes. It just happens to be that being outside gives you the most light, even
    if it's cloudy outside. This is because the glass on the windows blocks a lot
    of light. You can even measure it with your phone. You can download some app to
    measure the lumens inside the home or outside. So being outside in the morning
    is really helpful to get enough light. This sets you up for the whole day. It
    sets your proper cortisol and melatonin cycles, which are the other two hormones
    that are related to how active our body is and how sleepy we are. So just being
    outside gives you a lot of light.
  sec: 1289
  time: '21:29'
  who: Ruslan
- header: Behavioral biohacking
- line: So that's why it's called behavioral biohacking, right? Because you don't
    really take any mushrooms – you just know that your body needs light. You go outside
    in the morning, even though in Berlin, sometimes the mornings are really depressing
    during the winter. You still go out and then it gives you some light – enough
    light to sustain you throughout the day. Right?
  sec: 1336
  time: '22:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's about, again, our like evolutionary development. We needed the
    light to signal our body that, “Now is the time to go and pick berries or hunt
    or do some work.” We are biologically the same as we were 100,000 years ago, or
    maybe even 200,000 years ago. Even though our lifestyle changed a lot, our biology
    has not. In my practice with biohacking, I tried to replicate a lot of these natural
    ways of things – how our bodies should function in a healthier way.
  sec: 1359
  time: '22:39'
  who: Ruslan
- line: And getting enough light in the morning is, for example, good. Interestingly,
    if you have a candle lit at night, it doesn't… I will just say that if you have
    a lot of light in the night, it messes with your cycles. It's proven that high
    exposure to light in the night lowers your dopamine level for the next day. So
    you will not be as motivated to do stuff on the next day. Artificial lights are
    not very good and if you have some light, it should be behind your eye level,
    for example.
  sec: 1359
  time: '22:39'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Behind your eye level? How does it actually…? I'm sitting right here. This
    is my eye level. I'm pointing at my eyes. I need to put something right here,
    like a small lamp below my eyes. So maybe near my laptop, where I do something?
  sec: 1425

  who: Alexey

    below your eye level, so that you would need to look down on it and not up.

  sec: 1455
  time: '24:15'

    produce the same effect. Because I think our bodies adapted to candles and fire
    so far – but not to artificial light.
  sec: 1457

  sec: 1478

  who: Alexey
- line: As far as I know, it doesn't really matter, even though I've heard about blue
    light being a bit more negatively affecting dopamine and the whole cycle. But
    as far as I understand – no, it doesn't really matter. I think the biggest problem
    we have is not about the lights and lamps, but it's about phones. A lot of people
    go to bed with their phones, myself included, and they will have high brightness.
    That is definitely not good for having a healthy, long sleep.

    long before going to bed?
  sec: 1513

  who: Alexey

    not have a lot of light. If I try to follow the natural order of things where
    the sunset would be around eight o'clock, then maybe after that we do not want
    to get a lot of exposure to bright light.
  sec: 1522

    keep using it? What do I do with this?

    see anything.
  sec: 1554
  time: '25:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: But during the day, it's okay to have a bright light. It's good to have a
    bright light in the morning. I just think about it like – having a lot of light
    is healthy for you and then as you get closer to the evening, just have less light
    and that's fine.

  sec: 1588
  time: '26:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. As far as I know, it's a lamp that's strong enough and that can imitate
    natural light pretty well. They use it in Scandinavian countries because you can
    have a time in the year when it's very dark for a long period of time. That's
    how you could kind of imitate the sun. I haven't used it, but I’ve only heard
    good things about it – that it really helps. I also heard of an alarm clock that
    actually does not make the sound, but rather it makes it bright in the room, so
    it's easy to wake up. Lisa, if you can maybe tell me later how it is. That would
    be great.
  sec: 1591
  time: '26:31'

  sec: 1628

    good way to wake up.
  sec: 1639

  who: Ruslan
- line: This is how you wake up?
  sec: 1644
  time: '27:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I also tried to time my sleep so that I would sleep like seven and a
    half hours, or nine hours. I've been doing it for years since my high school days.
    Because we have good times to wake up and not-so-good times to wake up since our
    sleep goes in cycles. We start with light sleep and then we go into deep sleep.
    So I would usually just time my sleep and wake up in between the cycles because
    it's the easiest.
  sec: 1645
  time: '27:25'
  who: Ruslan
- header: Sleep cycles
- line: So we talked about meditation, we talked about light, and you said that sleep
    is the foundation of everything. We also probably need to talk a bit about that.
    It looks like you put quite a bit of effort (or at least it looks like that to
    me) to plan your sleep. You said “Okay, I need to sleep at least this amount of
    time or this amount of time. That means that if I want to wake up at seven o'clock,
    I need to go to bed at this time.” That's how you do it?
  sec: 1670
  time: '27:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: More or less, yes.
  sec: 1700
  time: '28:20'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Can you walk us through the process?
  sec: 1701
  time: '28:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Again, I'm not an expert here. When it comes to sleep cycles, I mostly
    speak from my own experience. But I've noticed that – generally, the foundational
    knowledge is that – when we go to bed and we fall asleep, we naturally have a
    very light sleep, so we can easily wake up. Then, as time goes by, we will go
    into a deep sleep. Our heart rate is lower, we have slower breathing, and so on.
    Then, we stay in deep sleep and then we go back to a very light sleep. We have
    a phase that's called the Rapid Eye Movement phase, when the blood pumps in very
    quickly, we breathe a lot, and we're ready to wake up. This whole cycle – from
    going to light sleep, to going into the deep sleep, and going back, for me, takes
    90 minutes. But I noticed, for example, that for my partner, it's a bit longer.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 1703
  time: '28:23'
  who: Ruslan
- line: So if it's a 90 minute cycle, that means I can sleep for one and a half hours,
    three hours, four and a half, six, seven and a half, or nine hours. And I noticed
    that it's better for me to sleep, one cycle less than to sleep a cycle and a little
    bit more. For example, if I have the option to sleep eight and a half hours or
    seven and a half hours, I would rather choose seven and a half because then I
    would wake up in between the cycles and I'll feel good. My body would be ready
    to wake up. As opposed to waking up in the middle of the cycle – in a deep sleep
    – and I would feel sleepy the whole day. So that's another little productivity
    tip I'm using.
  sec: 1703

    for you now?
  sec: 1811

  who: Alexey
- line: It's pretty easy, to be honest. I usually go to bed around the same time
  sec: 1816
  time: '30:16'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Seems like too much planning for me. In the evening, I'm tired and I just
    go to sleep. Then I have to think “Okay, now I need to wake up at seven.” So just
    put my alarm clock at seven, or eight or six, or whatever time I need to wake
    up. And that's it. Otherwise you need to calculate, “Okay, now it's 11, and I
    need to wake up at six. When do I need to wake up to feel good?” And then you
    start calculating all these sleep cycles. It's evening, you're tired…
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think if you really want to give it a shot, calculating seven and a half
    hours or nine hours is not that difficult, Alexey. [chuckles] [Alexey laughs]
    It's just like one mental task that takes less than a minute.
  sec: 1851
  time: '30:51'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Okay, so say you want to go to sleep now and you expect that in 10 minutes,
    you will fall asleep. Then you just take the time now plus 10 minutes, and then
    at seven and a half hours to that time. This is the time that you set up on your
    alarm clock. Right?
  sec: 1863
  time: '31:03'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 1878

  who: Ruslan

  sec: 1879
  time: '31:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, that happens sometimes. Then I would, again, try to just fall asleep.
    Maybe meditate a little bit and calm down. Breathe some fresh air. Because if
    it's very stressful – sometimes I could wake up at like five. It happens. And
    it's okay. I would just try to go back to sleep.
  sec: 1882
  time: '31:22'
  who: Ruslan
- line: But do you go to your alarm clock and adjust it?
  sec: 1903
  time: '31:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think so. Yeah.
  sec: 1907
  time: '31:47'
  who: Ruslan
- line: How do you know if you will fall asleep now or in half an hour or in one hour?
  sec: 1909
  time: '31:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know. I mean, it doesn't really happen that often. And if it does,
    try to minimize the light in the night and maximize light in the morning because
    it will set you up for proper sleep in the next few days.
  sec: 1914
  time: '31:54'
  who: Ruslan
- line: And by “minimizing the light during the night,” you mean to not look at your
    phone? Otherwise it's probably dark anyways, because it's night.
  sec: 1926
  time: '32:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but I mean before you go to sleep. Because usually, what I’ve also noticed,
    is that if you have a proper light “diet,” let's call it – a lot of light in the
    morning, very little light in the evening – it will usually only show itself only
    like one or two days later. It's not an immediate effect. It's something that
    our body needs to adjust to. So if you have these cases very often, where you
    wake up in the middle of the night, just try to have a lot of light in the morning
    next day, a little light before going to bed, or almost no light, and see for
    yourself – maybe it will improve.

    supports your concentration and energy levels?
  sec: 1978
  time: '32:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I can share what I've learned about myself so far. Yeah, exercise and
    nutrition is a very, very important topic as well, because it's proven again and
    again that it helps with focus and productivity. Plus it generally feels good
    to exercise. It’s a very healthy thing. It improves your cardiovascular disease
    risk, your blood circulates better, so you can do everything better. What I am
    doing in particular, is that I try to have enough protein.
  sec: 1989
  time: '33:09'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Protein is like a building block – amino acids that create muscles and a lot
    of other important tissues in our body. Also, protein boosts dopamine as well.
    So what I tried to do is, first of all, I was tracking calories and I was tracking
    how much protein I was taking in every day – for almost a year now. I'm not doing
    it, for the record, for the last month or so. But I was doing it before. I noticed
    that having a high-protein breakfast helps me to stay productive for the whole
    day.

  sec: 2088

    want. And if you have a weight-loss goal, then just make sure you eat less calories
    than your body actually burns. Then you will lose weight. Then having cheesecake
    for breakfast, I think is also fine.
  sec: 2091
  time: '34:51'
  who: Ruslan

    I guess the sugar part contributes more to that.
  sec: 2111
  time: '35:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's true. This thing about biohacking, for me, is a lot about dopamine
    and how to manage it. I would rather try to get dopamine from solving bugs than
    from eating sugar.

  sec: 2134

  sec: 2136

    sugar – and it's easier.
  sec: 2142
  time: '35:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I mean, social networks are so addictive because they also trigger
    our dopamine. That's why a lot of people procrastinate and watch YouTube videos
    or spend time on TikTok forever – because it's an easier way to get dopamine.
    Having moderation in these things actually helps you to stay focused on what you

    for lunch. Then, I see in myself that I can do more, and study better, and stay
    a bit more focused – so that I can eat better later in the evening. I don't know
    the specifics exactly, and I don't remember them, but if you have a heavy meal,
    your body needs to process it – to transform it into energy.

  sec: 2254
  time: '37:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but rice is also carbohydrates, which has sugar. It takes our body resources
    to transform it. The whole process is a bit complicated, but basically, after
    you have a lot of sugar stuff, you have a sugar drop in your blood as well. That's
    where you feel a little bit slow and fatigued and tired. That could be related
    to rice.

    know if it's the rice that contributed to my low energy level or a lack of sleep
    or a lack of sun or whatever. Maybe we can talk about these attribution models.
    How do you actually know that the thing you're doing – the diet that you have
    – actually contributes to your productivity or if it’s something else? How do
    you know that? That's the science part you mentioned at the beginning, right?
    You just believe it.
  sec: 2287
  time: '38:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, when it comes to weight loss, for example – I was measuring myself all
    the time and I was weighing myself every single day. I was also taking pictures.
    So I could just see if it works or not based on data. When it comes to productivity,
    it's a little bit harder to track. I know that some people have apps that ask
    you, “How are you feeling today?” So you can just have logs. You can basically
    give different ratings for yourself “Five stars. I feel amazing! I can win the
    whole world!” or something. Then another day you just feel low. I haven't been
    tracking that in terms of productivity, but I have self-awareness. Sometimes I
    can just see that I did a lot today and it was a great day. That's how I track
    it myself.
  sec: 2323

    doing all the things during the day?
  sec: 2370
  time: '39:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I see if I introduced a new habit, for example. Last year, I had a lot
    of migraines and I have theories about why my migraines happen. I had logs every
    day about whether I had a migraine or not. If I did have migraines, I would write
    down why it might have happened. So I know just going for walks, for example,
    and taking breaks from my screens, helped me to have fewer migraines. I don't
    have an ultimate productivity tip on how to track your productivity levels, but
    I think you can just assess it yourself by tracking.
  sec: 2377
  time: '39:37'
  who: Ruslan

    this data – track this data. If you don't, then you don't really know what is
    helping.

    as easy as collecting clicks on a website, right?
  sec: 2434
  time: '40:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s true. When I was doing weight loss and counting calories, I had to
    measure everything I eat or estimate it. That was a lot of effort. But you know
    what? We get used to stuff. If you have some routines and if you think it's really
    important for you, checking it and calculating how much time it takes, is not
    really such a big effort. We are putting in so much more effort for so many other
    things. When something becomes a habit, you don't really think about it, you just
    do it. So that's also the power of habits.

    I just personally like… [cross-talk]

- line: Why would you do this? [laughs] I don't know, if you like cheese, you just
    go, “Okay. Let's see how life is without cheese.”? Then you do this for one month
    and then you realize that life sucks without cheese and you start eating cheese
    again?
  sec: 2652

    my life.
  sec: 2665

  sec: 2673
  time: '44:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sometimes. Just to test myself. I mean, I like different challenges.
    I had a month without sugar last time. This month, I'm doing a month without carbonated
    drinks, for example. Because I like carbonated drinks. [chuckles] This kind of
    stuff is fun for me sometimes. I do it just for fun – to test myself. But I imagine
    that it can be boring or cause discomfort.
  sec: 2675

  sec: 2719

  sec: 2721

  who: Ruslan
- line: But what if I want to be productive like these people on LinkedIn?
  sec: 2725
  time: '45:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think you should be as productive as you want yourself to be. I wouldn’t
    set my goal to be somebody else, but just see yourself and where you want to be
    in what you want to be, and then just work towards that. I think that's a bit
    healthier and more sustainable way.

- header: Biohacking risks and ways to prevent them
- line: Are there any risks of biohacking?
  sec: 2747
  time: '45:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I guess. As I said, I'm not willing to try any stuff, for example, related
    to drugs and medicines, that haven't been tested on humans. But a lot of people
    do a lot of self-experimentation. I'm not doing that, because I think I would
    rather do something that's safe and feels a bit more natural in the beginning.
    And then if I see that I want to do even more then I would go for something else.
    The stuff that I talked about – looking at the sun in the morning, is pretty safe.
    Measuring how much you sleep is also pretty safe, because you should sleep enough
    – more than seven hours and more than eight hours. Eating less sugar is also pretty
    safe and eating enough protein as well.
  sec: 2752
  time: '45:52'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Depends on how much you already eat.
  sec: 2801
  time: '46:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, of course. Try to be cautious about what you do and try to find like
    literature or some credible sources that will tell you if it's healthy or not.
    Consult with your doctor if you're not sure about something. Some people have
    conditions, for example. Intermittent fasting doesn't work on some percentage
    of people because they have some conditions. And it might be even dangerous. So
    it's good idea to check with the doctor.
  sec: 2802

- header: Coffee and tea biohacking
- line: What do you think about coffee and tea? Are they helpful for productivity?
  sec: 2832
  time: '47:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 2838
  time: '47:18'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Would you consider having a cup of coffee biohacking?
  sec: 2839
  time: '47:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, coffee helps to increase alertness and remove sleepiness because it blocks
    a receptor of the hormone – I cannot recall the name right now. But it helps you
    to be less sleepy, basically. The only issue with coffee is that it can, again,
    reduce sleepiness and you will not fall asleep well, so it would mess up your
    sleep cycles. The general recommendation is not to have coffee after 2 pm or maybe
    after 12. I think everybody is different in how sensitive they are to one thing
    or another. When you hear things like, “Sleep at seven and a half hours,” for
    my girlfriend it might actually be eight. I can drink some coffee at 3 pm and
    I'll be fine, but for some other people that could even be 4pm or 2pm. I think
    coffee, generally, is not bad. It's a good stimulant and it can help you.
  sec: 2842
  time: '47:22'

- header: Using self-reflection and tracking to measure results
- line: We have quite a few questions, so maybe we should go through them. One interesting
    one is, “How do you measure productivity?”
  sec: 2901
  time: '48:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: As I said, I'm not that good at measuring my productivity. [chuckles] I can
    just self-reflect at the end of the day, “Did I do a lot or not?” And that's how
    I do it.
  sec: 2909
  time: '48:29'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Open a spreadsheet, and then for each day write, “Did I do a lot? Yes, no?”  [Ruslan
    agrees] “I did a little, I did a moderate amount, I did a lot,” right?
  sec: 2920
  time: '48:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I had this dashboard for myself in Notion, when I would write down all
    the habits that I was trying to learn. I was also tracking if I had a productive
    day or not. But again, I didn't really stick with it. I'm pretty sure there are
    apps that you can use to track your productivity. I think I would rather just
    look at my general feeling. “Did I feel productive or not? Did I have a lot of
    distractions or not? Could I stick to what I was doing or not?” For me, that's
    enough.
  sec: 2932
  time: '48:52'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Just curious, what were some of these habits in your Notion document that
    you wanted to try?
  sec: 2967
  time: '49:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I can look it up, but it was definitely doing sports, drinking water,
    and walking certain number of steps a day. Because I was sitting a lot and I tried
    to go for walks more to just move my body. So I was checking that.
  sec: 2975
  time: '49:35'
  who: Ruslan
- line: So just the simple things and then in your Notion, you would note that, “Okay.
    This day I walked my target level of steps and I felt good,” or whatever. Right?
  sec: 2996
  time: '49:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think also measuring stuff you want to change. Obviously, it's important.
    If you can't measure it, you cannot change it. I think measuring it not necessarily
    externally somewhere, but just in your brain, “Did I feel productive?” is enough
    for some things. But when it comes to habit tracking, I think this is a really
    powerful tool. If you can tie your results to some particular things – in weight
    loss, it was tremendously helpful for me. I would recommend you to do it. Again,
    it might seem like it's some work, and we might feel lazy about it, but if you
    think, “I really want to do it. I really want to change it.” Then it doesn't feel
    like much and you can get used to it pretty quickly.
  sec: 3007
  time: '50:07'
  who: Ruslan
- header: Mindset shifting
- line: Actually, you mentioned this “voluntary discomfort.” So if you're okay with
    creating artificial challenges for yourself and having fun while doing this, I
    guess it's also a mind shift, right? [Ruslan agrees] [cross-talk] “Now I’m taking
    away sugar. Let's have fun.” Even though life without sugar might be a bit more
    sad.
  sec: 3051
  time: '50:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. This mental model of, “I'm going to be good and feel good no matter
    what. If there is a challenging or risky thing, I'm just going to take it like
    a champ,” as I say, or just trying to have fun with it. It's actually a really
    powerful tool. Also with the dopamine and with sugar and everything, it's usually
    our perception of things that matter, but not the exact amount of things that
    we take or we do. The perception is really, really strong. That's how our brain
    really decides if we… I’m talking a bit in the abstract, but I hope you get what
    I mean.
  sec: 3075
  time: '51:15'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Yeah. It's like staying positive no matter what, even if the world is collapsing.
    I wonder, how do you actually do this? [chuckles] It's difficult. When you see
    that not everything is going according to plan, and life happens, how do you actually
    see things in a positive light? How do you focus on the good things?
  sec: 3111
  time: '51:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think I wouldn't give advice to stay positive even if the world is ending.
    [chuckles] I don't think it's good advice.
  sec: 3137
  time: '52:17'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Maybe I misunderstood you. It was the wrong conclusion. How did you say it?
    Do you remember?
  sec: 3143
  time: '52:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say, “Just be thankful for what you have and build on top of that.”
    Because there's always going to be something really, really big and bad, or small
    and bad. But there also can be good things. I'm trying to be thankful for what
    I have and then build on top of it, no matter how bad it is.
  sec: 3150
  time: '52:30'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Okay. That's the stoicism part you mentioned, right?
  sec: 3172
  time: '52:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 3176
  time: '52:56'
  who: Ruslan
- header: Stoicism book recommendation
- line: Can you recommend any books on stoicism – on how to do this mindset shift?
  sec: 3178
  time: '52:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, there's Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, I believe, who was a Roman Emperor.
    He was a very vivid stoic. And that's pretty cool. Even though he was an emperor…
    [cross-talk]
  sec: 3186
  time: '53:06'
  who: Ruslan
- line: That’s quite an old book, isn't it?
  sec: 3200
  time: '53:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. It’s like a thousand years old, but still very relevant. Surprisingly.
  sec: 3202
  time: '53:22'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Interesting.
  sec: 3209
  time: '53:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it was Marcus Aurelius who wrote Meditations. I'm not sure now. But
    yeah, Marcus Aurelius and Meditations. It could be and/or – that's very good.
  sec: 3210
  time: '53:30'
  who: Ruslan
- header: Work/life balance
- line: Another question, “How do you manage your time between professional and personal
    daily life as an engineer?” I don't know if there “as an engineer part” is important
    here. But, how do you do this?
  sec: 3225
  time: '53:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I want to say I manage it pretty well. [chuckles] I try to make a distinction.
    I try to have a work/life balance. For example, I also want to learn some stuff
    besides the job. I think it's important for me to realize how much I want to do
    something and if I really have a desire to do it. And then if I do, then I will
    always find time and energy to do it. If you want to ask how you should manage
    your normal life and like work life, just have a distinction first, and see what
    your priorities really are. I think, last year, or the year before, I wanted to
    focus on five things in life and just nothing else – nothing else would bother
    me.
  sec: 3241
  time: '54:01'
  who: Ruslan
- line: There are so many topics that I always wanted to dive in to – I could make
    a list of like 60 of them – but only five of them really mattered. That was for
    example, being with my friends and family more often, talking to them, or going
    for walks, doing sports, nutrition, and being productive at work and reaching
    my goals. So I would only focus on those and not try to do everything at once.
    If you feel blocked and that you cannot manage everything, try to find something
    that you can manage and just build from that.
  sec: 3241
  time: '54:01'
  who: Ruslan
- line: At the beginning of this interview, we talked about perfectionism. You said,
    at the beginning, that you managed to overcome it – to accept that it's okay to
    not be perfect. The question we have is, “How did you change your mindset to overcome
    perfectionism? Because it's super hard for me.”
  sec: 3321
  time: '55:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I would say that to overcome perfectionism, you need to understand two
    things and really accept them. First, accept that nobody's perfect and accept
    that you are not perfect and that it's okay. Accept yourself as you are, and accept
    others as they are, and see your own path in life.
  sec: 3344
  time: '55:44'
  who: Ruslan
- line: It sounds simple, but I guess there is more to that than just “Okay, now I
    accept it. Now my life is different.” Right? So how do you actually accept it?
    Is it like the meditation path that you mentioned at the beginning?
  sec: 3372
  time: '56:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. I think it took a psychologist to work with me in order for me to accept
    these things and to understand them deeply. One exercise I did that really helped
    me, I think, is looking at my past self and my future self and talking to myself,
    like, “What is the advice yourself as a five-year-old? Or as a 15-year-old? Or
    30? Or 45? Or 50? And so on? How would you talk to yourself? If you look at your
    old pictures, would you tell yourself that they are not perfect? You did this
    painting, but it's not perfect?” No, you just really accept yourself when you're
    young. You have kindness and love in your heart. So I think if you try to do this
    exercise, look at your old pictures. It's really, really powerful. It definitely
    changed a lot for me.
  sec: 3383

- header: Ruslan’s biohacking resource recommendation
- line: Another question is – I was going to ask this question anyways, but since
    it's coming from the audience, “Which book would you recommend to learn more about
    biohacking? Anything special for data scientists or ML engineers by any chance?”
  sec: 3443
  time: '57:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I would recommend not a book, but the podcast, and it's called Huberman
    Lab Podcast by Andrew Huberman. It has a lot of episodes about pretty much everything.
    Or a lot of things related to the healthy workings of mind and body and hormones,
    and what behaviors and protocols you want to do for that. I'm a big fan. Most
    of the stuff I learned was from him, even though I was also reading some other
    books. If I would just recommend one thing, it would be this for sure.
  sec: 3457
  time: '57:37'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Okay. Please give us a link. It's Huberman Lab, right?
  sec: 3488
  time: '58:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Huberman Lab. I, as a data scientist, was mostly interested in learning
    in the beginning, “How do I accelerate my learning?” and so on, “What does the
    science know about learning this?” and all of the other things. That's how I started
    watching the episodes and fell in love with the whole topic, and then I extended
    it to more areas, like the body and stuff.
  sec: 3493

    most favorite episode.

    time for today. We actually wanted to cover a lot more. That was quite ambitious.
    But that was fun. Thanks a lot for joining us today. Thanks for sharing all these
    tips and talking about your story. I have a lot of notes. Thanks for joining us
    today.
  sec: 3533

    obvious, they actually can help someone to have a better life. That would make
    me happy.
  sec: 3556
  time: '59:16'
  who: Ruslan
- line: Yeah. I will need to think about how I can have more daylight in the morning.
    That's a key takeaway, I guess, for me. Yeah. Thanks for this discussion. Thanks,
    everyone, for joining us today and I guess that's it. Have a great day, everyone!
