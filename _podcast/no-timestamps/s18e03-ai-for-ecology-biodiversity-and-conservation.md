short: AI for Ecology, Biodiversity, and Conservation
title: 'Scaling Wildlife Conservation with AI: Computer Vision, Remote Sensing & Citizen
  Science'
description: 'Discover AI-driven wildlife conservation: computer vision, remote sensing
  & citizen science for scalable species ID, habitat maps, alerts and policy impact.'
intro: How can AI actually scale wildlife conservation in the face of accelerating
  biodiversity loss and persistent data gaps? In this episode computational ecologist
  Tanya Berger-Wolf—director of TDAI@OSU, co‑founder of the Wildbook project, and
  director of technology at Wild Me—walks us through practical ways computer vision,
  remote sensing, and citizen science are transforming biodiversity monitoring. <br><br>
  We explore core AI techniques (machine learning, transfer learning, domain adaptation),
  image‑based monitoring with camera traps, drones and photo‑ID for individual tracking,
  and remote sensing for habitat mapping and change detection. Tanya addresses key
  data challenges—labeling, class imbalance, sparse observations—and the need for
  interoperable datasets, open standards and FAIR principles. We also cover model
  robustness, edge deployment in the field, ethics and Indigenous knowledge, scalable
  platforms like Wildbook, and how citizen science and crowdsourcing support quality
  control and long‑term monitoring. <br><br> Listeners will come away with a clearer
  understanding of tools and workflows for wildlife monitoring, practical barriers
  to scaling AI for conservation, policy and funding considerations, and resources
  to begin applying computer vision, remote sensing, and citizen science in their
  own conservation projects.
