description: 'Discover RAG and vector DBs strategies for search: build podcast chatbots,
  optimize embeddings, reduce LLM hallucinations and boost personalization.'
intro: 'How do you modernize search systems with vector search and retrieval‑augmented
  generation (RAG) without trading away relevance or inviting hallucinations? In this
  episode we talk with a search practitioner rooted in information retrieval who has
  worked with Solr, Lucene and the Semantic Web era and later in search consulting
  and teaching at Lucidworks and OpenSource Connections. <br><br> We cover the arc
  from classic keyword search to NLP, embeddings and vector databases (including Qdrant
  and plug‑and‑play vector search), and practical migration decisions: when to add
  vectors to an existing stack versus adopting a standalone vector DB. You’ll hear
  concrete guidance on RAG concepts to reduce LLM hallucinations, building a chatbot
  from podcast transcripts using Whisper, ingest strategies (chunking, overlap, embedding
  models), and orchestration with tools like LangChain. The episode also digs into
  prompt design, citation strategies, multi‑level RAG evaluation with human‑in‑the‑loop
  testing, and personalization approaches such as session‑based recommendations and
  re‑ranking. <br><br> Listen to gain actionable techniques for vector search, embeddings,
  RAG pipelines, evaluation metrics, and resources to deepen your knowledge.'
