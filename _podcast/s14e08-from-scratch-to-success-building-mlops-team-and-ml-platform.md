title: 'From Scratch to Success: Building an MLOps Team and ML Platform'
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about MLOps and building machine learning platforms.
    We have a special guest today, Simon. Simon has been building ML platforms for
    over half a decade. Currently, he is a Lead MLOps Engineer at Transaction Monitoring,
    Netherlands (TMNL). I was always wondering what TMNL stands for and now I know.
    It is a worldwide unique initiative of the big five banks of the Netherlands.
    Next to his work at TMNL, Simon is also a university lecturer for data mining
    and data warehousing. Welcome to our event.

  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks a lot. Thanks for having me.

  who: Simon
- header: Simon's background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of MLOps and ML platforms, let's start with
    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Actually, I started out my career while doing a Ph.D. – being a research
    and teaching associate, actually, to the Vienna University of Economics and Business.
    There I was doing some research in the area that was more focused on computational
    advertising. Machine learning was always applied to problems in the space of online
    advertising. Well, I wasn't a Ph.D. student for that long because, in the end,
    I found some very interesting challenges in practice. So I became a data scientist
    and worked for a consulting company in Vienna for quite some time. I started off
    as a data scientist and worked in a lot of interesting industrial AI use cases
    – visual inspection, predictive maintenance, all these classics. Then step by
    step.
  sec: 128
  time: '2:08'
  who: Simon
- line: Well, back then we also started to develop... This is also kind of how my
    MLOps journey started – we started developing a deployment and serving platform
    for our models that we built for our clients, simply because we actually found
    that this, back then, was a significant blocker when it comes to actually creating
    value with your machine learning models. That's also pretty much how my journey
    in the MLOps world started. Back then, at least, we were not aware of the name
    “MLOps” yet. Deployment and serving platform – that already sounded way too cutting
    edge for many companies that we were dealing with. After working in consulting,
    I moved to the Netherlands, where I'm still living.
  sec: 128
  time: '2:08'
  who: Simon
- line: There I joined bol.com, which is the largest e-commerce company here in Belgium
    and the Netherlands. I think even larger than Amazon, although Amazon also entered
    the market, I think two years ago. There, I was an expert machine learning engineer,
    a kind of Staff Engineer for Machine Learning. We dealt a lot with natural language
    processing, trying to understand our customers, building some transformer models,
    and working on GCP and Kubernetes. After that, that's a change to where I'm still
    at now – TMNL, Transaction Monitoring Netherlands. Here, I am the Lead Engineer
    for Machine Learning Operations. Actually, to be very accurate, I used to be the
    Lead Engineer for MLOps until two weeks ago. Now, my official title is Managing
    Engineering and Development – a bit of a different thing. MLOps is really, really
    still very close to my heart, but the focus in the data work has shifted a bit.
  sec: 128
  time: '2:08'
  who: Simon
- line: You're a manager.
  sec: 275
  time: '4:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm more focused on the effectiveness and collaboration of various tech teams.
  sec: 277
  time: '4:37'
  who: Simon
- header: What MLOps is and what it isn't
- line: Which is also actually a part of MLOps. Maybe we can also talk about what
    MLOps is and what it is not. I'm really interested to hear your take on that.
    Because for me, MLOps is not only about the tools you use for deployment – it
    is much more. [Simon agrees] So maybe we can talk about this right now. What is
    MLOps in your opinion? You said that five years ago, you had no idea that the
    thing you were doing was called MLOps, you just call it deployment. But right
    now MLOps is more than that, right? So what is it?
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I fully agree. Typically, when people hear the term MLOps, the things
    that always pop up in their brains are feature stores, experiment trackers, and
    model registries – that's what comes up. And that definitely is one part of MLOps.
    It's the tooling part – more the tech part, I guess. But at least I believe that
    doing machine learning operations successfully is a lot more than the tech part.
    It's actually... Well, the classic thing is that it's about people, processes,
    and technology.
  sec: 311
  time: '5:11'
  who: Simon
- line: The technology part, okay – feature stores, model registries – these pieces
    are what people are typically familiar with. But introducing machine learning
    operations successfully is a lot more than that. It requires processes, understanding
    how models are developed, how models will be developed, what are the actual use
    cases and the requirements we need to fulfill – this is actually where MLOps starts,
    understanding the processes behind model development, deployment, and serving.
    Because in the end, the tech part of MLOps is all about streamlining and automating
    exactly these processes.
  sec: 311
  time: '5:11'
  who: Simon
- line: Of course, the third part is people. Machine learning operations is still
    a fairly novel realm, and a lot of companies do have the challenge to think a
    bit about, “What skills do we actually need? What does it mean to build? What
    does MLOps mean?” And that might also mean something different for every company
    but, “What skills do we need to build a machine learning platform? What do we
    need to bring a model to production? To bring 100 models to production? And to
    operate them?” It's really a lot about people as well – people in terms of skills,
    but also people in terms of how they collaborate. So MLOps is a lot more than
    the tech part.
  sec: 311
  time: '5:11'
  who: Simon
- header: Skills needed to build an ML platform that serves 100s of models
- line: Yeah. To me, when I heard the term MLOps for the first time, I thought, “Okay,
    I've been doing this thing for so long.” But in my mind, it was mostly deployment.
    Like you, I think I followed a similar path. I started as a data scientist and
    then I noticed how difficult it is to deploy models – it's a significant blocker
    in the process of productionizing ML models. We were not really building a platform
    for doing this, but we were thinking, “How exactly can we make it simpler?”
  sec: 415
  time: '6:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: When the term MLOps came about, I thought, “Okay, I'm such an experienced
    MLOps person. I was doing this before it was cool.” But then I started learning
    more about this. There are things like a feature store that I had no idea what
    that was. Or experiment tracking – I understood that this thing that we used was
    actually an experiment. So there is much more.
  sec: 415
  time: '6:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: But, as you said, in addition to technologies, there are also people and processes.
    One thing you brought up was, “What skills do we need to build the platform to
    serve hundreds of models?” Did you find an answer to this question or are you
    still looking?”
  sec: 415
  time: '6:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: In principle, it's a difficult one, because it very much depends on the general
    organizational setup and fundamental beliefs of the organizations. At least in
    my world, and that's typically also the world I select, I believe in principle
    end-to-end, responsible teams for shipping products. That means, in my world,
    what I believe works well, is the building, the deployment, and the serving itself,
    being in the hands of what I call “streamline teams” teams that actually create
    value for the organization with their products.
  sec: 491
  time: '8:11'
  who: Simon
- line: A platform then, I considered on the one hand as a way to streamline processes
    – how these streamlined teams, teams actually working on ML powered products –
    how they develop their models, deploy them, and serve them. So it's about building
    a platform to streamline their processes, but also to make the processes faster,
    to make them worry about them less, and reduce the cognitive load on these teams.
  sec: 491
  time: '8:11'
  who: Simon
- line: When you think about building this “platform,” which is then really not actually
    about developing the model, then the skills that I typically saw to be incredibly
    valuable is this mix of infrastructure and cloud knowledge. Because these days,
    in most organizations – in many, many organizations – you do build your platforms,
    your products, in some kind of (whatever) cloud, whether it's AWS, GCP, Azure,
    etc. So the infrastructure and cloud knowledge is definitely something that is
    incredibly important for building an ML platform.
  sec: 491
  time: '8:11'
  who: Simon
- line: Things like Kubernetes, that sort of thing?
  sec: 593
  time: '9:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Kubernetes, Terraform – knowledge of, let's say, AWS services and how they
    can help you build what you want to build. Also, next to the infrastructure knowledge,
    it's really knowing how models are built – knowing your users, actually, your
    customers. Because as an ML platform team, your customers, your users, are typically
    internal data science teams, or at least product teams with some element of data
    science in them. Having an understanding for them is quite fundamental.
  sec: 595
  time: '9:55'
  who: Simon
- line: But do you mean that a platform engineer needs to know what finding a derivative
    in the functional space means?
  sec: 631
  time: '10:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, not at all.
  sec: 638
  time: '10:38'
  who: Simon
- line: So it's “XGBoost exists and whatever it gives – the model outputs some numbers.”
  sec: 640
  time: '10:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so pretty much the latter. I believe that to be a successful ML platform
    engineer or MLOps engineer as I sometimes call them, you have to know the data
    science workflow – how do data scientists actually work? You need to have an understanding
    that, yes, data science is an experimental discipline as well. There needs to
    be space and support – tooling support, process support – for doing experimentation,
    for example. All these are things that, if you come from a classic software engineering
    background – typically, this is something you have not quite seen or you don't
    quite understand why somebody would work in a notebook, right?
  sec: 647
  time: '10:47'
  who: Simon
- line: Yeah, for me, that was the first reaction when I saw a Jupyter Notebook. [Simon
    agrees] I was a Java developer and then somebody showed me a Jupyter Notebook
    and said, “Okay, this is how we do things.” And I'm like, “Oh, my God. Really?
    Where's my...” Back then I used Eclipse (IDE), so I was like, “Where is my IDE?
    What is this? It's awful.” [chuckles]
  sec: 683
  time: '11:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, as an ML platform engineer, you need to understand why people actually
    choose this and how...
  sec: 708
  time: '11:48'
  who: Simon
- line: Why would you program in a browser? Right? [chuckles]
  sec: 714
  time: '11:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Yeah. So understanding your users, understanding how models should be
    deployed, what deployment patterns exist – these things matter. What doesn't matter
    for an ML platform engineer, typically, is what you said, “Why would I choose
    a root mean squared error over a mean squared error?” For an ML platform engineer,
    that is not quite important. It's important to understand that there are certain
    valuation metrics, perhaps – on that level.
  sec: 717
  time: '11:57'
  who: Simon
- line: These metrics exist, but I don't really need to know the difference between
    mean average error versus something else.
  sec: 749
  time: '12:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. At least that level of knowledge should be sufficient to build
    tools that help your data scientists do things more effectively. Of course, the
    deeper your knowledge, the better. But there are hardly any unicorns, right? So
    you need to prioritize a bit. Typically, the two things are important, and the
    third thing is, obviously, for writing Terraform, you also will need to write
    some Python, for example. You will need to perhaps write some Java, depending
    on your context – so the classic software engineering part also is of importance.
  sec: 763
  time: '12:43'
  who: Simon
- line: So infrastructure and cloud are the first thing. Then knowing about the process
    of building models is the second thing. You do not need to know them in detail,
    but you need to know how the process starts, what  things the data scientists
    do, and what the output is. That's the second thing? [Simon agrees] And then the
    third thing is being a software engineer.
  sec: 805
  time: '13:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. Yeah.
  sec: 828
  time: '13:48'
  who: Simon
- header: Ranking the importance of skills
- line: How important are each of these things? If you put them in order in terms
    of importance, what's the most important one? And what's the least important?
  sec: 830
  time: '13:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hmm. Good question. In principle–dodging the question a bit–I always believe
    that a team needs to have the sum of these skills. That needs to be right. In
    a team, you might have specialists who really have a big strength on the cloud
    engineering end. For them, for example, that's what they would add to the team
    and they might have close to zero knowledge of how models are built. And that
    is okay if there is another person who can augment it.
  sec: 838
  time: '13:58'
  who: Simon
- line: But if I had to rank them for one person, I would say infrastructure knowledge
    is number one, software engineering knowledge is number two, and understanding
    of how models (how data scientists actually work) is number three. Also, because
    I believe that's probably the thing that you can catch up on the easiest. Also
    your users (your customers) will let you know, hopefully, when you build stuff
    that just doesn't work for them.
  sec: 838
  time: '13:58'
  who: Simon
- line: Or have a data scientist on the team – somebody that was a data scientist,
    but now is more interested, let's say, in software engineering or platform engineering.
  sec: 893
  time: '14:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. That's what we typically try to aim for also at TMNL currently. In
    the machine learning operations team, who are building the ML platform, that's
    also what we have been seeing is really, really effective –  bringing a mix of
    specialists and a bit generalists together. Some specialists in cloud engineering
    and infrastructure, and some people who have been data scientists, and over time
    transition. Typically, the sum of these parts really makes a good ML platform
    team.
  sec: 902
  time: '15:02'
  who: Simon
- line: How many people should there be? At least two?
  sec: 934
  time: '15:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, it depends a bit on your platform's availability requirements. For example,
    if you need to have people on standby and so on, then you need to factor that
    in.
  sec: 939
  time: '15:39'
  who: Simon
- line: You mean if we want to make sure that this platform is up and running all
    the time, then somebody will need to be on-call. [Simon agrees] Then if something
    happens during the night, they would get notified and they would wake up and fix
    the thing. One person cannot do this, so there should be at least three people.
  sec: 954
  time: '15:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. Even two people cannot really do this. It really depends on the
    load on your platform. How many teams and people use it? How business-critical
    actually is it? That, I think, defines a lot of the real headcount requirements.
    If you just think about building it – let's ignore any significant operational
    overhead that comes from just having it up and running 24/7 – four people, five
    people, six people are typically nice numbers for an engineering team. But you
    can also have a nice mix of skills. It's difficult to answer. It depends.
  sec: 976
  time: '16:16'
  who: Simon
- header: The point where you should think about building an ML platform
- line: At what point should I actually think about building? Let's say, six people
    – especially now, when everyone's budgets are kind of tight – does it actually
    make sense to build a team of six people while they can be doing something else?
    Maybe it's a good idea just to buy an existing platform? There are quite a few
    on the market. Right?
  sec: 1012
  time: '16:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think these days, there are not many companies who make, and should
    make, the choice to build an ML platform from scratch. I think usually what companies
    look into – companies that are not Uber or Amazon, and these these big tech companies
    – typically what normal companies look into is, “How do we buy tools from vendors,
    how do we integrate them into our landscape, and how do we make them work together?”
    Usually, it is more, “What do I buy?” And maybe some parts you build yourself.
    But even if you “buy” platforms or parts of platforms, there is a lot of integration
    effort – gluing things together and making it fit to your workflows – because
    these might be very different depending on your organization, depending on your
    use cases.
  sec: 1034
  time: '17:14'
  who: Simon
- line: Even if people advertise end-to-end platforms, you can be quite sure that
    you will either need to adapt your processes or you will just need to bend some
    things to actually make it work for you. But to your original question, maybe
    – when should you start building a platform? Typically, there are a few “smells
    that you see,” which gives a bit of an indication that you should consider thinking
    about a platform. For example, you have a set of engineering teams that have data
    science somewhere in their products. Let's say you have five or ten teams, and
    a couple of these teams make products that are powered by some model.
  sec: 1034
  time: '17:14'
  who: Simon
- line: Let's say there's a team that takes care of some recommendation engine, a
    team that takes care of some natural language processing. I'm also thinking now
    a bit about my ecommerce experience. If you then see the themes, reinventing the
    wheel and doing training, serving – all of these things – in very different ways
    without actually having a really good reason, that's usually the point where you
    should think about, “Hmm. Maybe a platform that helps me standardize some things
    and take away rebuilding things. That could then definitely make sense.” And typically,
    then you can also calculate the business case and see if it will pay off or not.
  sec: 1034
  time: '17:14'
  who: Simon
- line: One thing you mentioned was that teams do things in a different way, and “teams”
    is literal here. It means that you have to have at least multiple teams in your
    organization in order for them to do things differently. Right? [Simon agrees]
    If you're a smaller company, you may just have one team.
  sec: 1185
  time: '19:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think in that case, it doesn't mean that you should not consider a
    platform. Because even for one team, at least some elements of a platform – for
    example, an experiment tracker, which is only one piece of a larger platform when
    you build or procure it – that is something that can be super important and a
    massive boost in effectiveness, even for one team. These things, especially if
    you go for some isolated pieces, typically there are SaaS offerings, where you
    do not need to worry about any maintenance whatsoever. That is something that
    comes with very, very little overhead – engineering overhead does cost something,
    obviously. But these are things that you should consider in any case, even if
    you have one team building things. When I talk about platforms, typically, in
    my mind, it's more comprehensive software and infrastructure that helps you do
    what you want, but at scale.
  sec: 1204
  time: '20:04'
  who: Simon
- header: The importance of processes in ML platforms
- line: One thing we talked about was processes. We talked about skills that people
    need to have, but we also mentioned processes. Actually, one of the skills is
    understanding these processes and understanding how data scientists build models.
    Another thing you mentioned is, if you use an external platform – for instance,
    for building an external ML platform – the flow they have (the process they have)
    in mind when building this external platform might not be the same as the process
    you have. Then you would need to readjust (to re-do) your projects in a way that
    fits this platform. The processes here seem to be quite an important part. I'm
    wondering what these processes are. So can you maybe walk us through a simple
    process?
  sec: 1263
  time: '21:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Simple process. As a simple process, usually, a data science workflow
    starts with pulling data. That's typically where the work of a data scientist
    starts. Let's say you want to do some exploration because you want to start building
    a new model – you want to train a new model. Your process (your workflow) would
    start with pulling data into an exploratory environment (into a notebook, for
    example). That's usually where it starts. So then you go on to... perhaps you
    need a cluster to actually do proper exploration and experimentation on that dataset?
    Well, again, a branch of your process will be, “Well, you actually have  the need
    for a bit more powerful, scalable compute environment in an exploratory setting.”
    Part of your process is starting to branch off. Then you will train something
    – you need to evaluate it, you want to keep track of your experiments. That will
    also be a piece of your process – something that your platform should help you
    to do, that it should cater to – keeping track of your experiments, of your model
    training and evaluations.
  sec: 1317
  time: '21:57'
  who: Simon
- line: Then, as the next step, you want a persistent model, and perhaps share it
    as well, and make it available to services – downstream processes. Now you need
    a model registry for that. The story goes on. How is that model going to  be consumed
    by a downstream service? Does it even need to be consumed? Is it maybe only a
    batch job that actually runs this model? When we speak about processes, that's
    exactly it. Depending on your use case – depending on how your people built these
    models – that process will look different and you might have several processes,
    depending on your team and your use cases, again. So when I say you need to understand
    your process to build a platform (to think about tooling, even) this is exactly
    it. You need to understand the data science products are built in your company.
  sec: 1317
  time: '21:57'
  who: Simon
- line: So for example, if most of our projects (like 78% of the ML projects) don't
    need to be up and running all the time – we just execute them in batch – then
    maybe we do not need to invest a lot of time in making a platform that can serve
    these models online? [Simon agrees] You should focus on batch first. Right?
  sec: 1441
  time: '24:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. That can be a very... I think what you said is already one step further.
    Prioritization. Because you could build this beautiful platform that does it all
    and serves every single thing that you might want to do. But that's not how you
    typically build. You want to build iteratively and incrementally when you build
    your platform. So you need to prioritize and if you see, as you said, that 70%
    of your models – and let's say the value that these models generate is equivalent
    to the quantity – that's typically what you want to build out first.
  sec: 1464
  time: '24:24'
  who: Simon
- header: Weighing your options with SaaS platforms
- line: It's also important that you decide which platform to buy, because maybe not
    all the platforms support batch. I know I definitely saw a couple that do not
    support batch mode. They only support online, like web services. Then I was like,
    “Do I really need this? It's not really what I want.” Some of these platforms
    offer “batch” which is just sending a lot of requests to the online service.
  sec: 1500
  time: '25:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a good one.
  sec: 1530
  time: '25:30'
  who: Simon
- line: I'm thinking, like, “Do I really need that? Or maybe I need something else?”
  sec: 1532
  time: '25:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's a very good point. Even thinking of Amazon SageMaker – a very popular
    service, especially for companies already on AWS. The way that batch processing
    is recommended is pretty much what you said. They call it batch transform. What
    it does is spin up an endpoint, shoots, let's say, your complete batch run against
    it – and in batches, we often deal with large amounts of data – it shoots 100
    gigabytes of data against it, and then it tears down the endpoint again. And that's
    batch mode. It's actually spinning up an endpoint, tearing it down. Whether that's
    really what you want, and whether it is cost-effective for you, and whether this
    is optimal from a performance perspective, is questionable, of course. That's
    what you really need to look into. A very good point that you made.

- line: On paper, they have “batch transform,” but you into this, it's like, “Oh.
    That's not what I need.” This comes back to the second set of skills that you
    mentioned – you need to understand the process, (how exactly models are built)
    in order to understand that, “Okay, this actually makes a difference. If I want
    my batch jobs to be fast, then this platform does not work for me. I need to do
    something else. Maybe I need to build my own stuff with Spark or whatever.” Right?
    [Simon agrees] I see.
  sec: 1578
  time: '26:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: And that might not be the killer argument to not to go for the platform, but
    you will need to build something custom or go a different route, perhaps. Bend
    it. For example, TMNL is heavily using SageMaker as well. Well, I need to bend
    some things and find other ways of how to do batch processing without using batch
    transform. But that also bites you a bit, because in that specific case, if you
    followed the recommended path, then you would still get some nice features down
    the line – automated bias unfairness detection out-of-the-box (Clarify they call
    it). That's what you do not get, or the integration is just so much harder, if
    you go for the non-batch-transform – the way that when you don't spin up an endpoint,
    shoot your data against it, and tear it down again. So there are downsides to
    then having to branch off and build custom stuff.

    and you authenticate to BigQuery, write your SQL query, and the notebook pulls
    in your data. That would be an exploratory setup. Of course, you want to have
    enough infrastructure power behind your notebook so that you can actually do what
    you want to do, usually.

  sec: 1721
  time: '28:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Databricks, AWS has it – I think pretty much all the big cloud vendors.
    But the platform component about that is really giving your data scientists the
    ability to provision the resources that they need to do their job. Obviously,
    as a data scientist, you don't want to then configure and spin up via infrastructures,
    code your own cluster. But what you want to do is just click some buttons to spin
    up your cluster and connect. This is really the platform part – making it easy
    for people to do their work.

- line: Okay, so that's the data exploration part, where we pull the data, we explore,
    and we see what we can actually do with this data. The second step is, once we
    did the initial exploration, we train and evaluate models. Then you mentioned
    that we need to experiment tracking tools, right? So that's another set of tools
    (or another tool) that we need in addition to the first one. Right?
  sec: 1781
  time: '29:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think an experiment tracker is something that most teams – specifically
    teams that at least use some evaluation metric to evaluate their models – could
    benefit from a lot. It's usually one of these low-hanging fruits, just to move
    from keeping track of your experiments in an Excel sheet to actually something
    that... Well, that works – that's scalable and also shared and transparent (to
    your team, at least).
  sec: 1806

    usage. You also mentioned that we need a thing called a model registry. I know
    that the experiment taking and model registry are usually the same tool, for example,
    MLflow. Right?
  sec: 1832

  sec: 1850

  who: Alexey

    registry, metadata store, meta data tracker and store – that is something that,
    when you look at MLOps tooling vendors, it's something that you very often see
    packaged in one SaaS offering.
  sec: 1858

  who: Simon
- header: What comes after deployment?
- line: Then we kind of finished the training phase, and then we go to the deployment
    phase. We need to make sure that somebody can consume the output of this model.
    Then we talked about deployment – we need to understand if we want to serve this
    online thing, serve as a web service, or it should be a batch job. We also talked
    a bit about the tools. You mentioned that it's possible to do with SageMaker.
    I think I brought up Spark. So there are a bunch of tools like that. After deployment,
    there is something else, right? It's not the end of the process yet?
  sec: 1875
  time: '31:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think even deployment typically depends a bit on how opinionated you
    want to be as an ML platform. That's also a piece that you could build, and you
    should consider building for your teams – reusable, centralized, managed deployment
    pipelines – especially if you have some narrow use cases. Let's say two or three
    use cases that you do very, very often. If the patterns that the models follow
    are pretty much the same, then you should even consider building and managing
    centralized deployment pipelines. Even that is something that you could take away
    from your data science focus teams. It's not always a good thing – it doesn't
    always make sense. It's something to always carefully weigh between flexibility
    in the teams and what you, as a platform, push out. That could be something.
  sec: 1911
  time: '31:51'
  who: Simon
- line: 'After deployment? Well, it''s about serving. Serving, at the principal decision,
    is always, “Well, is it batch? Am I just going to load the model in some batch
    job – in some, let''s say, Spark job? Do some pre-processing and run it and store
    my predictions in some table?” For example, that''s an option. I think there,
    it''s usually not so different from your training infrastructure. Typically you
    would choose some workflow orchestrator: Airflow, SageMaker, SageMaker pipelines
    (if you want to be in that ecosystem). Typically, it''s a similar tooling choice,
    at least as you will also do for training, when it comes to orchestrating what
    you actually want to do.'
  sec: 1911

    compared to model training in a batch job. It's usually a sequence of jobs – data
    loading, pre-processing, feature engineering, training/inference, and then just
    your output artifacts are different. On the one hand, you have a model as an output
    artifact, and you would store it in the model registry, whereas in the batch inference
    job, you will usually have data, predictions, whatever, as output and store it
    somewhere.

    from scratch based on PaScal (or whatever).” Or is it that here, we mean more
    like, “Okay, what are the tools that are available there? Let's see how we can
    take these tools, see if these tools fit, whatever requirements we have, and how
    we can stitch together these tools into something meaningful at the end.”?
  sec: 2041
  time: '34:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, the latter. Again, the former... I cannot really not think of a reason
    why you would build your own experiment tracker. I'm certain that there are good
    reasons in some very, very niche use cases. But these tools have become a bit
    of a commodity even. There are lots of these tools out there, from open source
    to self-hosted open source solutions, to fully-managed SaaS solutions – pretty
    much everything you can think of. I think they're are very few reasons why you
    would really build that experiment tracker yourself. Usually, it's really about
    getting the right tools, integrating them,  making them easily consumable, and
    making them fit to your data science workflow.
  sec: 2068

  who: Simon

    and make this a seamless experience.
  sec: 2114
  time: '35:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think it's a common misconception that people have, when you think,
    “Well, such an ML platform? I mean, I'm just gonna buy SageMaker (or I'm just
    gonna buy Vertex AI).” Yeah, it's not so easy, usually. Well, buying it is very
    easy. The company is happily gonna take your money and give you access to their
    compute infrastructure. But again, as you mentioned, the devil is really in, “Does
    this really support what I want to do? Does it support what I want to do given
    certain constraints (most companies have constraints) meaning data governance,
    security, specific types of models?”
  sec: 2126
  time: '35:26'
  who: Simon
- line: Nowadays, when you think about large language models, for example, it's not
    trivial to fit some special needs of large language models into existing ML platforms.
    I think what you can see, specifically based on this, what you could see in the
    last one or two months, is that so many vendors in the MLOps space have pushed
    out really, really nice updates to their platforms (to their tools) that would
    allow you better handling of large language models. And large language models
    now are one example.
  sec: 2126
  time: '35:26'
  who: Simon
- line: Usually, as an organization, you would have just some niche – some weird,
    weird stuff that's not default, and therefore not as easily and nicely supported.
    Or another thing is – which we are specifically investing a lot of time and energy
    in these days – improving developer experience. It's not nice for a data scientist
    to interact with raw Amazon SageMaker. It's a lot of overhead. You need to think
    about BPCs, you need to think about encryption, and these things. You should not
    need to think about this as a data scientist.
  sec: 2126
  time: '35:26'
  who: Simon
- line: Yeah, sometimes I really question the design choices that the SageMaker team
    made at some point. [Simon agrees] Why would I need Lambda in front of a SageMaker
    endpoint? Why would I see the CSV data in my request instead of JSON? [Simon agrees]
    Things like that. Okay. Some things look pretty arbitrary. [Simon agrees] It's
    not something data scientists will use at the end, so you need to make some tooling
    around that to make it easier to use.
  sec: 2240
  time: '37:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that just takes away the unnecessary complexity and introduces some
    opinionated things. For example, if you want data scientists to use a specific
    KMS key to encrypt their data at rest, this is something that you would abstract
    away completely in a thin layer on top of SageMaker. Then data scientists don't
    need to worry. They just can be sure the data will be appropriately encrypted.
  sec: 2271
  time: '37:51'
  who: Simon

    can do in one week? Or is it something that you need a team to work on for half
    a year?
  sec: 2300

  sec: 2311
  time: '38:31'
  who: Simon

  sec: 2314
  time: '38:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: I believe that the layers around an existing platform should be as thin as
    possible. It always depends on what you really want to achieve. There is one side
    where you basically say, “I want my models to be built independent of whatever
    they are running on.” Meaning, “If I want to migrate from SageMaker to Vertex
    AI, for example, I do not want to have to change my models, but I'm going to change
    the platform piece. I'm going to change the interaction patterns with these models.”
  sec: 2320
  time: '38:40'
  who: Simon
- line: If you want to achieve that, then your platform will naturally need to be
    a tad thicker, compared to when you just say, “Well, I trust that we are going
    to stay on SageMaker for many, many years to come. What I want to do is improve
    the developer experience.” Then a fairly thin layer – something that is really
    a matter of months to develop – can be sufficient.
  sec: 2320
  time: '38:40'
  who: Simon
- line: A matter of months, so it's still not like you buy the SageMaker platform
    and you're good to go. You still need to put in some effort for it to be usable.
  sec: 2381
  time: '39:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would definitely say so. Again, it always depends on your company. I might
    also be quite biased because currently, I'm in the Fintech space and when it comes
    to financial stuff, there are a lot of regulations. There are fairly strong (for
    good reason) requirements and everything that's security-, compliance-, auditability-related
    – of course, that raises the bar significantly. If you deal with, let's say, some
    IoT-generated data (machine data) where, if you lose that data, you've just lost
    the data, but no person is affected whatsoever, then you might have a lot fewer
    restrictions – a lot less requirements on many things. That will naturally translate
    to different choices when building your platform.
  sec: 2394
  time: '39:54'
  who: Simon
- header: Keeping data governance in mind when building a platform
- line: You also worked in algorithmic advertising, right? [Simon agrees] And you
    also worked in e-commerce. [Simon agrees] I guess the requirements there are less
    strict compared to Fintech?
  sec: 2443
  time: '40:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Depends on the use case as well. Even in e-commerce, you can have quite sensitive
    use cases. Think of fraud detection. Customer data. Fraud detection – if you detect
    a case of fraud, and you ban the person from your platform, well, you need to
    be able to show why this happened. You basically need to be auditable. That means
    you need to show for a certain period of time exactly why this decision was made
    and what happened.
  sec: 2457
  time: '40:57'
  who: Simon
- line: There are certain requirements, typically, around being able to explain your
    model and being able to ensure your model is not biased and that it's fair. That
    can even mean e-commerce – with sensitive use cases, even there, that's going
    to be more challenging. However, if this is a fraction of your use cases, (which
    it probably is in e-commerce) then you will probably not build your platform for
    that. You will build your platform for 90% of use cases.
  sec: 2457
  time: '40:57'
  who: Simon
- line: So what to do with these cases – with data governance, with security, with
    auditability? I don't know how much SageMaker offers in this disregard. I guess
    you still need (especially for a bank) to build something on your own, right?
    Or are there actually tools that you can just take and adapt to your use case?
  sec: 2696
  time: '44:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think, especially for SageMaker, it definitely makes a lot of things
    easier. Just thinking of emitting and storing of metadata – what specific image
    your job used, what data (what inputs) it consumed, what outputs it wrote. It
    makes the tracking of these things, storing it persistently as well, and connecting
    your metadata over various pipeline runs – it makes it fairly easy. There's still
    some glue code to be written if you want to be able to, let's say, visualize that
    or have it nicely connected in a kind of data model. You will then still need
    to do a lot of glue work. Also, when it comes to reproducibility, actually. Let's
    say you want to reproduce the results of a model that you ran three years ago.
    In theory, of course, your model is stored in the model registry and it's going
    to stay there for a couple of years if you don't delete it. But what about all
    the other stuff?
  sec: 2568
  time: '42:48'
  who: Simon

    [Simon agrees] You can go back in time and... [chuckles]
  sec: 2600
  time: '43:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Which version of the data was used three years ago. Right. Yes, SageMaker
    does help you for some things. But you need to think this process through end-to-end
    and make sure that this works. And that's what SageMaker doesn't do for you.
  sec: 2608
  time: '43:28'
  who: Simon
- line: What actually is data governance when we talk about this specific case – when
    we're talking about ML platforms? Because data governance is a very large topic
    and we already had a couple of podcast episodes about that. When it comes to an
    ML platform, is there any specific part of the data governance framework that
    is most important for platform engineers?
  sec: 2622
  time: '43:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a good question. Usually, when you look at MLOps tooling, the first
    touchpoint you typically have with consuming data from a data warehouse (data
    lakehouse or whatever) is that tools – such as Weights & Biases, Neptune, Comet
    ML – usually have some sort of data tracking functionality included. What that
    means is actually fairly different, depending on the tool. Some tools really focus
    on logging, and storing metadata around your query, for example – what was the
    query you used to fetch data?
  sec: 2645
  time: '44:05'
  who: Simon
- line: Whereas some other tools go even beyond that and say, “Well, basically you
    log the entire artifact.” By artifacts, I mean the data you actually used. That
    means basically, you would say, “Well, I want to store that artifact – all the
    data that I consumed for a specific model run, I want to store it in some other
    cloud storage – cloud storage provisioned by that vendor, for example, or cloud
    storage that I have (some S3 bucket, for example).” That's typically where it
    starts. There are already different approaches emerging in how you actually keep
    track of your data.
  sec: 2645
  time: '44:05'
  who: Simon
- line: I think if you use MLflow, then you kinda need to arrive at the need of storing
    the data yourself. So you would put the data to S3, and then maybe you would keep
    a pointer to this data. [Simon agrees] While in Weights & Biases (which I think
    has this feature, I'm not sure about others), you can just log the entire... Yeah,
    all of them have  that. You can just say, “Okay, this is the data. Keep it.” You
    don't need to implement this yourself. [Simon agrees] That's pretty cool.
  sec: 2724
  time: '45:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Yeah. While it's pretty cool, if you're dealing with smaller datasets
    – completely fine, right? You're just going to copy that, I don't know, 10, 15,
    100 megabyte dataset. Well, if your models run on tens or hundreds of gigabytes
    of data, this actually becomes difficult to use. And not only difficult to use,
    because obviously, it's a cost. Especially if you're using some proprietary storage
    of that vendor – if you don't want to upload like 50 gigabytes of data every time
    you train your model. That hurts. But not only that, but also managing that data
    appropriately becomes a challenge.
  sec: 2750
  time: '45:50'
  who: Simon

  sec: 2791
  time: '46:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. What if a GDPR request comes and that you need to delete a specific
    person from your data? Well, good luck doing this. If you log all your data every
    time you train a model, it's gonna be extremely hard to find that person and reliably
    delete it. So you really need to think about, “How do you manage your data to
    be compliant with certain regulations?” as well, especially if you do things like
    logging (duplicating, basically) your dataset every time you run your model?
  sec: 2792
  time: '46:32'
  who: Simon
- header: What comes first – the model or the platform?
- line: We have a couple of questions. The first question is kind of a chicken and
    egg problem. The question is, “Sometimes I encounter problems when trying to build
    a whole pipeline from scratch with no models built yet. How do you deal with drafting
    the infrastructure?” Also, maybe this is a continuation, “Do you even need to
    think about building the platform before building the model? What should come
    first?”
  sec: 2828
  time: '47:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Good question. I believe that always, especially if you want to do this
    in a profit-oriented organization, there needs to be a business case first. I
    think there are hardly any organizations that would say “Yes, please build that
    platform because at some point we're going to build some models.” It's typically
    very hard. It's beautiful if you can do this, because it's a full green field
    project and it's going to be a lot of fun. But it's very hard to argue, usually.
    Usually how it goes is – you would have a set of models already running, generating
    some kind of business value, and then you would look at, “What would it have saved
    us, on the one hand, if we had a platform?” And you want to project (look a bit
    into the future) and think, “How many models do we actually expect to have in
    a year (in two years, in five years)? And what will this mean if we don't build
    a platform? Are we actually scalable in our efforts?” That's usually how you would
    start thinking about the platform. But usually, the models come first. Otherwise,
    it's going to be difficult to argue. And also to build, actually.
  sec: 2855
  time: '47:35'
  who: Simon
- line: It's the business case, right? [Simon agrees] Can we do this in parallel?
    For example, we just started the data science initiative in our company, we know
    that we will have a lot of use cases in the future, and there is one business
    case that we selected as the most promising one. Do we need to maybe try to start
    building the platform in parallel to the case? Or first, develop the case, develop
    the model, and see how to deploy (to start building) the platform for this specific
    case?
  sec: 2925
  time: '48:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think there are some pieces of a platform that already make a lot of sense
    with one model. I mentioned it before – an experiment tracker is a classic thing.
    That is something, I think, that is going to pay off no matter what size you are.
    Even for a single model or for a single team that is definitely something that
    I believe you should consider, at least if you have a couple of data scientists.
    That will make sense. There are other parts of the platform where it's going to
    be very difficult to build the platform in a targeted way if you do not have a
    good picture of what it should cater to.
  sec: 2959
  time: '49:19'
  who: Simon
- line: It's basically trying to build a product but you don't really know your customer
    yet. Or your customer doesn't even know himself yet – he doesn't even know, “What
    am I gonna want? I know that now I need to open this store. But tomorrow maybe
    I need to close it again. I don't know yet.” So usually, you would want to have
    at least a user, a customer, or a customer base, that kind of knows which use
    cases are coming up so you can build an architecture around it. If you don't have
    anything, then it's a lot about guessing (estimating) what's going to come.
  sec: 2959
  time: '49:19'
  who: Simon
- line: It can work, but you might be building things that are really just not going
    to bring that much value to your customer or they're just never going to be used.
    I think every person who builds a platform has experienced this – thinking way
    too far ahead, and you're building something that's going to maybe be used two
    years or three years down the line.
  sec: 2959
  time: '49:19'
  who: Simon
- line: So the summary here would be to wait with heavily investing into the platform,
    before you have at least a handful of use cases. Right? Then you see what's common
    in these use cases and how you can abstract away some stuff on there to the platform?
  sec: 3057
  time: '50:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely, I think that's very, very well summarized. Naturally, it does
    not mean that you should not build abstractions. If it makes your life easier
    as a team – if you build some abstraction on top of SageMaker – well, do it. If
    it makes the lives of three data scientists easier, do it. You may call it a platform,
    and it may be just the starting point, actually, of something bigger.

- header: Do MLOps engineers need to have deep knowledge of how models work?
- line: Thank you. Another question. “It seems that MLOps is biased more towards software
    engineering. Do we still need to invest time in learning state-of-the-art models?
    Or we just take whatever is there, such as what Hugging Face or another framework
    offers and not bother with learning SOTA?”
  sec: 3101
  time: '51:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Ooh, that's a good question. If I understand it correctly, what you're saying
    is that there are quite some Hugging Face as a model platform, and also a kind
    of a vendor (a service provider) that makes your life fairly easy already. So
    the question, as far as I understand is, “Do we even need to worry that much about
    MLOps itself if there are some...”
  sec: 3307
  time: '55:07'
  who: Simon
- line: Maybe the question is, “Do we need to worry about learning about these models
    – the internals of these models?” Or we can just take whatever Hugging Face offers
    and, as a platform team, maybe we don't even need to worry about it. But maybe
    as a larger organization, some teams might want to learn more about state-of-the-art
    things. How does it affect our office platform engineers?
  sec: 3331
  time: '55:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's definitely a good point, I think for an ML platform engineer
    (for an MLOps person who builds a platform), it's not really going to matter whether...
    Often, it's not going to matter which exact type of model you want to run. However,
    there are definitely cases where this matters. Again, I'm going to fall back to
    the example of large language models. If your models reach an extent, or are in
    a way, that place specific requirements on your platform, on your infrastructure,
    for example, or on your deployment flow, or on your evaluation flow – it's especially
    interesting for large language models, again – then you, as a platform engineer,
    definitely should think about these aspects. You shouldn't necessarily think about,
    “How does this model work exactly?” But really, “Would this model run on my platform?
    Or why would it not?” That will help you evolve your platform into directions
    that make it potentially future-proof, if these use cases will become relevant
    for your organization.

- header: Is API design important for MLOps?
- line: Thank you. Another question, “How important is API design for MLOps?”
  sec: 3255
  time: '54:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, API design is... It depends a bit, again, on what you want to run. From
    an ML platform perspective. It depends a bit on if you want to abstract that away.
    What's definitely important is for the team who wants to deploy this model, is
    that it needs to serve predictions to a set of consumers, then you, as that team,
    need to think about what that API should look like and how you would evolve it
    over time as well. From a platform perspective? There, it depends a bit.
  sec: 3262
  time: '54:22'
  who: Simon
- line: I would say it's not something that you typically care about that much as
    a platform – as a producer of data and teams that build and deploy and serve models.
    They are producers of data. They should worry about, “How do I make and keep this
    consumable?” As a platform, I would think about, “How do I make it easy to deploy
    it and serve it via an API?” But what that API specifically looks at is typically
    not something that the platform engineer would probably look into.
  sec: 3262
  time: '54:22'
  who: Simon
- line: For me, at some point, it became important. The case was when we wanted to
    log predictions in such a way that it's unified across all the use cases. For
    example, imagine that you have a model for churn prediction. You send a request
    to the platform, the platform replies with the prediction, and you save these
    predictions, you save the incoming request, and you have saved the response in,
    let's say, some database (in some log storage). You want to run some analytics
    on top of that.
  sec: 3329
  time: '55:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: In order to do that, you want the logs to be unified across all the use cases.
    So the churn prediction use case, the lead scoring use case – all the other use
    cases should follow a similar schema in order for you to be able to analyze this
    later and maybe do some monitoring, some analytics, etc. But yeah, this is maybe
    a specific one. You don't always think about this until you need to do this. But
    sometimes, yeah, it's important.
  sec: 3329
  time: '55:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's a good point. I would imagine in that role you were part of the
    team that was building these models. Yes?
  sec: 3393
  time: '56:33'
  who: Simon
- line: Yeah. I was kind of a part of all the teams. My role was to overlook the entire
    process. I connect the platform team and the users of the platform.
  sec: 3403
  time: '56:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay, yeah. Makes a lot of sense, especially in that position, I think – is
    such an interface position.
  sec: 3423
  time: '57:03'
  who: Simon
- line: Okay. Well, this could be wrapping up. Maybe the last question for you is
    – we talked about building a platform, the skills we need, and I know that you
    have written a lot of stuff. Actually, the questions we prepared were questions
    about stuff you wrote, but we never had a chance to get to them
  sec: 3432
  time: '57:12'

- header: Simon's recommendations for furthering MLOps knowledge
- line: So maybe you can recommend some further reading, if people want to learn more.
    It could be from you or from other people. Maybe there are already books about
    this stuff, maybe there are good courses, or good videos, good talks about this
    topic.
  sec: 3452
  time: '57:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Well, of course, as you said, there are some good books about MLOps
    and machine learning engineering. What's important to notice is that MLOps is
    a term that, I think, is not yet not very well defined. For example, when I speak
    about MLOps, it's usually from a platform perspective – I'm thinking about ML
    platforms. For other people, it's very different. For them, machine learning operations
    is basically everything from deployment onward. That's also a bit of the case
    with the books. There are some books, for example, Designing Machine Learning
    Systems is a very popular one. It's also a very good one. But it does not take
    very much from the platform perspective, actually. It's really more around building
    that model. Nevertheless, it's a great book.
  sec: 3469
  time: '57:49'
  who: Simon
- line: I also particularly like Practical MLOps, also a book by Noah Gift and his
    co-author (Alfredo Deza). What I liked about that one is that it's, like the name
    says, actually very practical. That also means that it's really going to show
    you how to build things on the three big cloud providers. That, I believe, is
    a great, great asset to have. That also brings me to my overall recommendation
    – books are great, but putting things to practice – building your pet projects
    – is what I really recommend.
  sec: 3469
  time: '57:49'
  who: Simon
- line: I think that's also why I love DataTalks.Club (the MLOps Zoomcamp, specifically)
    because that's what you guys are doing and that's really where you learn. That's
    also not only where you learn, but also how you can showcase your skills to a
    future employer, for example. So it brings together a lot of these things. Don't
    get too stuck in books – start building. That's what I would recommend. But that's
    also the type of learner that I am.
