short: Mastering Self-Learning in Machine Learning
title: Mastering Self-Learning in Machine Learning
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about self-studying and continuous learning in machine
    learning and bioinformatics. We have a special guest today, Aaisha. Aaisha is
    a self-taught bioinformatician, machine learning engineer, and data scientist
    from Johannesburg, South Africa. She graduated from Machine Learning Zoomcamp
    that we have here in the DataTalks.Club and she studied Python and basic web development.
    She also maintains a blog on bioinformatics and machine learning topics. Beyond
    that, she is interested in many other things, such as photography and digital
    art. Maybe if you saw the picture we have for the cover today – there is this
    space mushroom, this is what we talked about – this is something Aaisha drew.
    Welcome to our interview today.
  sec: 74
  time: '1:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Glad to be able to speak on the podcast and thank you for having me.
  sec: 124
  time: '2:04'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Yeah. The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer.
    Thanks, Johanna, as always, for your help. You're very helpful in preparing all
    these questions.
  sec: 127
  time: '2:07'
  who: Alexey
- header: Aaisha’s background
- line: Let's start. Before we go into our main topic of self-study and continuous
    learning in machine learning and bioinformatics, let's start with your background.
    Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 137
  time: '2:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: My career journey, I would say, is just beginning still, considering I'm basically
    a student. I've been mostly doing my studies up to now. I started studying Python
    quite a few years ago. I don't remember how old I was – I think I was like 12,
    or something, or 11 maybe. I did introductory Python and then I did JavaScript
    and HTML and CSS – the standard, “I want to do coding, what do I do?” package.
    Then I discovered data science and bioinformatics and I was like, “Okay, this
    is a cool field to go into.” And I started studying that.
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I was also studying biology and chemistry and the more science-y fields. Recently,
    I started going into more machine learning and actually focusing on trying to
    build my career in machine learning. So that is my goal now – to establish myself
    in machine learning and still be able to do my bioinformatics along with it. If
    there's some way I can merge these two different fields I've been doing. And then
    scientific illustration is something I want to pursue on the side, maybe as a
    second field or something like that.
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Scientific illustration – what is that?
  sec: 225
  time: '3:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Like in the New York Times? Or the New York Times is different. Maybe they're
    not so much scientific, but I think I know what you mean.
  sec: 241
  time: '4:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I've seen that there are scientific illustrations published in the New York
    Times as well. So that's one of them. Then it’s also just generally making art
    to explain science, basically. That’s how I describe it. It’s explaining science
    through art in a visually engaging, appealing manner for people who are maybe
    not so much into science. They just have a general interest in science. It’s dejargonifying
    science and explaining it in an easy, nice manner. That’s what I consider scientific
    illustration – or art as a whole.
  sec: 248
  time: '4:08'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I think we had a podcast episode maybe over a year ago or so. It was with
    Meor and we talked about visualizing machine learning. We spent most of the time
    of that interview discussing how exactly Meor comes to his visualizations – how
    he goes from a concept to an illustration and what the process is. Probably it's
    related, right?
  sec: 281
  time: '4:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's a similar thing.
  sec: 309
  time: '5:09'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Okay. You said you started studying Python 12 years ago or so – quite some
    time ago. [cross-talk]
  sec: 311
  time: '5:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it wasn't that long ago. I was 12 myself. I was 12 years old.
  sec: 321
  time: '5:21'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Ah. 12 months ago, not 12 years?
  sec: 326
  time: '5:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it wasn't 12 months ago – I was 12 years old when I started studying Python.
    It was five or six years ago.
  sec: 329
  time: '5:29'
  who: Aaisha
- header: How homeschooling affects self-study
- line: I see. What I'm trying to ask is, you're not taking these classes as any part
    of a formal education, right?. You're just going on the internet, finding things
    there to study and you just study them, right? Or how does it work? How do you
    learn all these things?
  sec: 337
  time: '5:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: I wouldn't say I just go on the internet and just start studying things. I
    try not to be randomly pursuing everything I find interesting. [cross-talk]
  sec: 358
  time: '5:58'
  who: Aaisha
- line: But it’s formal education, right? It's self-study. You’re not doing this at
    university.
  sec: 368
  time: '6:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it’s self-study. I've been homeschooled, so technically I haven't gone
    through any formal education. I went to school. I've not gone to uni. Technically,
    if I was going to school, I would be going to uni now. I'm not going to uni. I've
    not been to any school. Everything I know, either my mom used to teach me before
    that or self-study. So I’m either homeschooled or self-taught.
  sec: 371
  time: '6:11'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Interesting. I don't think I’ve ever spoken to anyone who was homeschooled.
    How did it feel?
  sec: 397
  time: '6:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's such a difficult question to answer. I don't know what it would feel
    like going to school because I've literally never gone to school. [chuckles]
  sec: 405
  time: '6:45'
  who: Aaisha
- line: But it would be your mother just teaching you some stuff and then eventually,
    maybe it was just you studying things?
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Obviously, when I was a kid there were my parents who would teach. We'd
    study whatever. We never followed a curriculum or anything. At that point, that's
    why I started studying programming or scientific stuff much earlier than I think
    I would have gotten in school. I found it interesting, so my mum would gather
    resources and let me learn it and teach me or whatever. After that, once I was
    old enough, I just started studying by myself online with online resources and
    stuff.
  sec: 423
  time: '7:03'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Interesting. Well, when my kid is sick, we need to do some homeschooling too.
    I just don't have the patience to actually sit with him and explain all this stuff.
    So your parents must be very patient people.
  sec: 459
  time: '7:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. [chuckles] My parents put up with a lot of stuff.
  sec: 473
  time: '7:53'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Well, I guess you have more flexibility this way. So if you want to travel,
    you just go and travel. Right?
  sec: 478
  time: '7:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Even not just traveling, but just in what I'm studying. There's so much
    more flexibility than in school where you're studying one thing and you can't
    study everything you want because you have to follow the school system. This way
    I can study things – I can pick and choose what I want to study. If there's something
    I already know, then I don't have to go through it again like I would have to
    in a school curriculum.
  sec: 484
  time: '8:04'
  who: Aaisha
- header: Deciding on what to learn about
- line: What I wanted to ask you next was what motivated you to take this approach.
    I guess you kind of answered that already because you have been doing self-studying
    since forever – since school days. [Aaisha agrees] So maybe what is interesting
    is – how do you decide to learn? There are so many things on the internet. You
    open any data science subreddit or any data science community and then you're
    immediately bombarded with all these links and all these new things. Then you’re
    like “Okay, I have to study all that. And if I don't have this I fear of missing
    out.” So how do you approach this systematically? How do you not go crazy when
    you need to do this? [cross-talk]
  sec: 513
  time: '8:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: As a general topic – let’s say I want to study bioinformatics or whatever
    – I think I started following it out of interest a bit more, because I always
    wanted to do this cool scientific research and stuff. But it hasn't always been
    possible to pursue that path. Then I discovered that there's something more realistic
    within my reach that I can do with tech stuff online and with the resources I
    have available. I still get to do the quiz science-y stuff, but it's practical
    because I can do it. That is how I began studying it.
  sec: 561
  time: '9:21'
  who: Aaisha
- line: In regards to finding resources, maybe I did waste a bit too much time doing
    introductory Python courses. [chuckles] Because I was like, “Okay, well I did
    this course and I did that course,” and I faffed around for a while. But then,
    I think I've just gotten good at finding the “good” resources. You get the hang
    of it after doing it for a while – finding out that these are the best resources.
    It also helped that I had a sort of guideline in my mind of what I need to know.
    I need to know this much of biology or chemistry or whatever and my Python skills
    need to be at this level.
  sec: 561
  time: '9:21'
  who: Aaisha
- line: For bioinformatics, specifically, I found this really cool pathway made by
    the Open Source Society University, where they make these tracks and stuff. So
    I followed that. I think, generally, filtering out information is a skill [audio
    cuts out].
  sec: 561
  time: '9:21'
  who: Aaisha
- line: You were talking about different tracks. There are some open curricula online
    and you found some tracks for bioinformatics and this is what you studied.
  sec: 753
  time: '12:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I was saying that, in general, for finding resources, I think studying
    a lot of them online helps with that. You can start curating the resources that
    you find and know, “Okay, this covers this skill set. Maybe this is not what I
    need right now. It might be cool, but maybe I can do it at some later point and
    not now.” You can also find communities where people have gathered resources,
    “Okay, to achieve this certain skill set, this is what you need to learn.” And
    then you can either follow those specific resources, or you can find alternative
    resources.
  sec: 768
  time: '12:48'
  who: Aaisha
- line: But I think majorly what has helped is having an idea in my mind of what skills
    I need. If I want to pursue machine learning, I need a basic introductory look
    at machine learning. That's why I did the Zoomcamp in the first place. I was like,
    “Okay, this seems like a good resource to get my basics down.” Then once I know
    a bit more about the field, then I can decide, “Okay, what skills do I need to
    develop further?”
  sec: 768
  time: '12:48'
  who: Aaisha
- header: Establishing whether a resource is good
- line: I have so many questions based on what you just said. There are so many interesting
    directions. First of all, you said that you developed a feeling – when you look
    at the resource, you know that it's good. I wonder – how does it work? How do
    you know? Let's say you look at a Zoomcamp – of course, the Zoomcamp is maybe
    not a very good example. [chuckles] Let's not take Zoomcamp. Let’s say you take
    a resource. How do you know if it's good? How do you understand that?
  sec: 829
  time: '13:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are a few things I look at. The first one I do is skim the syllabus
    or whatever and then see if the content that they're teaching is something that
    I need right now – if it's applicable to me right now. Obviously, there's so much
    good stuff that I want to learn and I'm like, “Okay, maybe knowing exactly how
    stars explode in space is not something I need to know right now.” Obviously,
    that's something I just throw out the window then and there. But then say I pick
    up a course on machine learning and I see that “Okay, the syllabus is good. It's
    teaching me how to use a framework that I need to know right now.” Then I watch
    the introductory videos and see that “Okay, does it feel like this course is offering
    quality? Does it look like something that is being taught in a good way? Does
    it look like the people know what they're talking about? Or am I gonna get ripped
    off here?” That kind of thing – just gauging the general quality of it.
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Aaisha
- line: If you were to pick up a book and you flip a few pages around, read a bit,
    and you'd see, “Okay, does this look like something that is quality? Or does it
    look like somebody just wrote a bunch of stuff that they don't know what they're
    talking about and published it.” Because obviously, on the internet, it's like
    that YouTube stereotype where there are people on YouTube who don't know what
    they're talking about. But there are so many good resources on YouTube as well.
    You can get an idea for how much the person knows what they're talking about,
    how beneficial it might be, if you skim through it a bit and just pick out bits
    and pieces and listen to them or whatever. Then you can decide that “Okay, up
    to now, this looks like something that's good.” And then you can commit to studying
    it and then see how it is.
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Aaisha
- line: You mainly look at free resources? Or do you also consider paid courses?
  sec: 962
  time: '16:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: I try to go for free where possible, obviously, because it's more affordable.
    But if it’s good resources, I'm not averse to investing in it. If this is something
    that will benefit me or my career down the line, then it's a worthwhile investment.
    But I will make sure that if I'm invested in something, then it is quality and
    it is worth it. I will try to avoid investing in something that I can learn with
    free resources, even if it's a harder study or whatever.
  sec: 967
  time: '16:07'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Skimming a paid course might be more difficult, right? Because you don't have
    access to the course, usually. Maybe some parts, but you don't usually get the
    access to the course to know if it's good or not. So you cannot really check it
    out in advance.
  sec: 999
  time: '16:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: For a paid resource, I'd go more like, “Okay, who's the author that published
    it? Is there any free content that they've put out?” Somewhere where I can get
    a general idea for their sort of content elsewhere – aside from this one paid
    course. You can get a general profiling of who is teaching the course before you
    pay for it – see if it's credible or not, see their credentials, what work they've
    done, that kind of thing.
  sec: 1014
  time: '16:54'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Deciding whether a recourse is relevant to what you want to learn
  sec: 1014
  time: '16:54'
  who: Aaisha
- line: It’s funny that you mentioned information about how stars explode, because
    this is what I was just reading the other day. That's pretty cool stuff and it's
    quite interesting. But maybe, like in this example, if you study machine learning,
    then obviously astronomy is not super relevant to that. At least most of astronomy.
    This is kind of a no-brainer. If you want to learn about linear regression, you
    know that how stars explode is not…
  sec: 1041
  time: '17:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] It’s not going to help you.'
  sec: 1069
  time: '17:49'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Yeah. But when it comes to machine learning, there are many things. For example,
    when I was studying machine learning, I thought that support vector machines are
    super important to understand. Also because I was taking a machine learning class
    at the University and at that university, the teacher was doing a lot of research
    on support vector machines. I thought that it's very important to really understand
    these things well.
  sec: 1071
  time: '17:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: But when I started working, I understood that nobody really cares about them
    – support vector machines are not really useful anymore. So how do you understand
    that? How do you understand these things? Okay, astronomy is not relevant, but
    when it comes to machine learning, there are some topics that are perhaps more
    relevant, some are less relevant. So how do you understand which direction to
    go?
  sec: 1071
  time: '17:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is just something you do and then realize, “Okay, it wasn't that needed.”
    I spent a lot of time doing a data science course that had a lot of data visualization,
    and also data cleaning and everything. At that point, I was like, “Okay, maybe
    this is not the direction I want to go in.” It's not that important. I was doing
    it for machine learning or data science more. Seeing how the data is cleaned is
    maybe good knowledge to have, but maybe not as relevant as what I wanted to do
    then. I did it and maybe it will come in handy later, but at the time it was not
    what I was looking for. I think that's just something you have to figure out,
    that this was not as relevant, after the fact that you studied it. Because there's
    no way you know that without studying it.
  sec: 1117
  time: '18:37'
  who: Aaisha
- line: There’s no silver bullet. Okay. I thought maybe you would just tell me “Okay,
    do that and that. Then you know what is relevant.”
  sec: 1165
  time: '19:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] No. Unless I maybe somebody can figure out some spells. Then please
    share with me. [chuckles]'
  sec: 1172
  time: '19:32'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Well, I guess in this case, the community is helpful. You can always ask people
    who went through it.
  sec: 1177
  time: '19:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think to some degree, maybe you can get an idea by doing your own research
    or finding people more in the field and if they have done interviews or question/answers,
    you could ask them. Communities could be helpful. But I think to some degree,
    it's unavoidable that you end up studying something and you're like, “Okay, maybe
    it wasn't that important.” At least in my experience.
  sec: 1184
  time: '19:44'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Sorry, I interrupted. I just wanted to say that while doing my Master's, and
    also my Bachelor’s, I also studied a lot of stuff that is not relevant. Maybe
    if I was doing self-study instead, then things would have been different, right?
    Maybe I would have actually spent more time on studying things that are relevant,
    not because of what the teachers thought.
  sec: 1212
  time: '20:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: There was somebody who mentioned that they were studying computer science
    and they said that for the first two years of the curriculum, they didn't touch
    computer science at all. They must learn English, math and chemistry. It's funny
    how the school system works. Why must you study chemistry in your university when
    you're majoring in computer science? That's one thing to have basic knowledge
    of.
  sec: 1238
  time: '20:38'
  who: Aaisha
- line: And it's one thing that you're studying in university when you're trying to
    study computer science. Whereas you could just focus on computer science and learn
    whatever is necessary and if there are any gaps in your knowledge, you can also
    go back and study it later. It's not like if you didn't study chemistry in your
    first year, but then you need it in your fourth year, it's the end of the world.
  sec: 1238
  time: '20:38'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Yeah, indeed. Well, I did not have that when I was studying computer science.
    Well, we had chemistry later. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1281
  time: '21:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: It also depends on where you're studying. I'm just giving an example.
  sec: 1289
  time: '21:29'
  who: Aaisha
- line: We did have chemistry, but later, in the third grade. It was clear why we
    did. I mean, I had fun, I like chemistry. It was cool. At university, I also kind
    of enjoyed it, but it's not something I really needed to know apart from having
    pleasure from studying this, and not the obligation. Yeah, but we did spend a
    lot of time studying math. While it was fun – I enjoyed solving all these equations
    of these things – again, at my work as a data scientist, most of these things
    aren’t really needed.
  sec: 1293
  time: '21:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's one thing to have to study something because you find it interesting,
    or if you want to go into a research field or something so you study it. But I
    think in a day-to-day application, you're hardly going to need a lot of this kind
    of stuff. And if you need it, again, say you’re pursuing a career path and you're
    like, “Okay, this is needed,” you can study it then, instead of wasting all of
    your time studying it when you could be building up a main skill instead.
  sec: 1331
  time: '22:11'
  who: Aaisha
- header: How Aaisha focuses on learning
- line: How do you approach this? How do you approach learning? Do you focus on building
    projects? Do you focus on learning theory first? How does it work for you in general?
  sec: 1362
  time: '22:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think a balance of both is needed. Obviously, without building projects,
    there's always that aspect to just theory, which is lacking. You could know something
    very well in theory, but in practice, your knowledge will end up falling short
    and you run into issues, which you wouldn't have in knowing how to solve with
    just a theory. But I also think learning new things in theory is important, like
    building new skills, or advancing your skill set, especially in something like
    tech if you build more projects in a particular field. But then you're not learning
    new skills. At some point, you're gonna be like, “Okay, these skills that I have
    are outdated. And I spent all my time building a bunch of projects with a skill
    that's now falling out of the market.”
  sec: 1375
  time: '22:55'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I like learning more about building projects, but I also like reading and
    stuff. I'll just read a bunch about things and then I'll go and build a project.
    Then I'm like, “Okay, I did half of the things I learned weren't needed. And half
    of the things I needed to build the project I didn't know.” Then you hit Google.
    [chuckles] So I think a balance of both is a good way to go, so you’re covered
    on both fronts.
  sec: 1375
  time: '22:55'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Yeah, I'm a big fan of the projects approach. I think I neglect theory, which
    is maybe not the ideal case. It should be both, like you said.
  sec: 1449
  time: '24:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: To some degree, projects are always a bit more interesting because you've
    got problem solving or whatever. So I think that projects have a bigger appeal
    at some point.
  sec: 1461
  time: '24:21'
  who: Aaisha
- header: Deciding on what kind of project to build
- line: I was wondering, how do you decide what to build? If you want to build a project,
    there is probably a skill that you want to master. How do you decide that, “To
    master this skill, I want to build this project that should do this, this, and
    that.” How does it work for you?

- line: I don't know. I just think of ideas first and I'm like, “Okay, this would
    be a good way to use these skills.” I like just surfing on the internet – and
    finding data and stuff, I like just finding good data. Then I think, “Okay, what
    can I do with this data? I want to use this data because the data is interesting.
    Okay, I want to get better at Pandas. I could use this data to build something
    with this framework. Let's just do it.” There isn't a lot of reasoning behind
    my projects sometimes beyond “It's cool. Let's do it.” [chuckles] I like going
    on those dataset searches and just typing keywords that I am interested in and
    then just seeing what comes up and picking random stuff that is cool.

    go to Kaggle or whatever dataset website and then you can just look for astronomy.
    Then you think, “Okay, there is an interesting dataset. Let's see what I can do
    with it.”
  sec: 1541
  time: '25:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Another way of finding cool data is – people publish research papers
    on random stuff, outside doing stuff, and for a lot of them, they publish the
    data with it. It's not clean data a lot of the time, because it is not meant to
    be used for data stuff. But if you clean up the data, it's a cool way of finding
    data that's linked to a study or something. Then you can see, “Oh, what else can
    be done with this data? Can I make something cool using this data in a different
    way?” I like just going to studies and reading them because I like reading scientific
    papers just for the fun of it. [chuckles] Sometimes I bookmark the studies that
    are cool and then just see what I can do with the data in my free time.

    time reading about horse color genetics. I was like, “Okay, if the horses have
    this color, then how do their color genetics work? Then how does human pigmentation
    work?” And I just fall into a Google rabbit hole and I find cool research papers
    about it.

  who: Aaisha

    my Master’s thesis (when I was writing it) of course, I needed to do some research
    to understand what was done before my work and what I can base my work on. I found
    Google Scholar very useful. Do you use it?
  sec: 1635
  time: '27:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I use Google Scholar. But often I just go on the main Google and I just
    search “research article” or “article” as the keywords. You can get things like
    PubMed nature articles. There are quite a few. I forget the names now, but there
    are quite a few free publications that allow you to read the entire thing without
    paying for it. It's good for when I'm just sitting free. I just end up spending
    hours on Google wasting my time reading absolutely random stuff. But sometimes
    the data that comes from it is useful.
  sec: 1661

    agrees] I also remember spending a lot of time on that. But I kind of had to do
    this because one of the chapters in my thesis was on state of the art research.
    That was a part of the thesis. But I can understand how fun it could be when you
    have a topic that you're interested in – to just explore it.

  sec: 1718

- line: Yeah, but it's not a huge long thing. You don’t have to study for one year
    to get a degree. I'm already studying bioinformatics, which has been going on
    for like three or four years. I wanted something that doesn’t go on for that long.
    It's something that, “Okay, just be quick about it. Don't spend years.” I thought
    it was a good way to break into machine learning. It's gonna offer me a good comprehensive
    look at the different aspects of it. I got this from reading your syllabus and
    everything.

    projects. I was like, “Okay, let's give this a try. It should be interesting.”

- line: Okay. [chuckles] Well tell her “Hi.” Anyway, we were talking about projects,
    right? Since you mentioned it, this is what I wanted to talk to you about. In
    the Zoomcamp, we have these three projects. I wanted to talk to you and understand
    how exactly you approached them. What was your approach when it came to selecting
    projects? How did you decide what to do there? Was the dataset also your first
    approach? Or how did you go about that?
  sec: 1865
  time: '31:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I've chosen the dataset first approach. The first capstone project that
    I was doing – the Kaggle competition for the kitchenware thing, I ran out of time
    to build a separate one for the capstone. So I used the same project in both places.
    But the first project I did (the midterm) was about predicting the toxicity of
    frogs based on their color. Initially, I was going to make something – I wanted
    to find something cool, because I didn't want to do the economic, political, property
    and price data, because those are boring. I don't want to do it.
  sec: 1895
  time: '31:35'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I don't remember where I went – either it was a Google dataset search or some
    other website. I just searched for “poison” or something like that. I initially
    wanted to do “the most toxic poisons” or something like that. But then I found
    this one, where they did an entire study about how a species of frogs’ color indicates
    its toxicity – its brightness and everything. So I was like, “Okay. Well, what
    if I make a model that can, if you input the data, predict the species of the
    frog instead and its toxicity.” So that's what I built.
  sec: 1895
  time: '31:35'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I built a model that takes the values – the values had to be given in an accurate
    form that the study measured them in, so it wasn't practical, probably – but then
    I would just predict how toxic that frog species would be. I just went on the
    dataset search in Google. I think the next one I did was landscape recognition.
    For that I also went on Kaggle. For that one, I wanted to do something with image
    recognition, so I just went on Kaggle and I opened the image recognition datasets.
    I saw a landscape classifier there. I didn't have too much time that time around,
    so I just picked an easier one and went for the landscape classifier.
  sec: 1895
  time: '31:35'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Well, this one about frog toxicity is really interesting. I guess this is
    one of the things that were interesting for you back then and you decided to find
    something about that?
  sec: 2013
  time: '33:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I actually wasn't even looking for anything to do with frogs. I was
    looking for something to do with poison. I'd been reading on poison recently and
    was like, “Okay, this is good. Let's do something poisonous.” I saw the frog one
    and did my research – I read the research papers and read about that species of
    frog and I was like, “Okay, this is way cooler. We're doing this.” [chuckles]
  sec: 2022
  time: '33:42'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I kind of want to ask you more about – how did you even come across this poison
    topic? Because a part of self-study, I guess… you said you spend a lot of time
    just doing random stuff on the internet, reading things. So I'm really curious
    how exactly it happened. Did you even realize that now you're all of a sudden
    interested in poisons?
  sec: 2042
  time: '34:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I honestly didn't. I keep finding random things that are interesting and
    I just spend a lot of time Googling them until I'm bored with them and I don't
    ever think about them again. Poison was one of those things that I found interesting
    and read about. But it's not a lasting interest. [chuckles]
  sec: 2069
  time: '34:29'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I see. Do you somehow structure all these things – all these topics? Poison,
    like you said, horse genetics, and all the other things? Or do you just keep everything
    in your mind? How does it work for you?
  sec: 2086
  time: '34:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. These are mostly just like, “I'm free. I have free time, so I just do
    random stuff.” But none of these are structured. It’s just like “Okay, whatever.
    It’s interesting at the moment. I'm not gonna read about it.” If I have free time
    or if I push my time around, then I'll just squeeze them in anywhere I can. But
    it's not something I dedicate time to reading about or anything. They are very
    unstructured.

    Is it related to your interest in bioinformatics in any way?
  sec: 2147
  time: '35:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Bioinformatics is more born from my general… At that time I was very much
    obsessed with being a researcher. I wanted to do it at any rate. I don't want
    to be one anymore. But at that point, I was like, “Biology and chemistry research
    is all I ever want to do in life.” Then, obviously, that was not possible at the
    time because I didn't have the resources available to pursue that. And that's
    probably a good thing, because now I'm not so sure if I want to do that.
  sec: 2156
  time: '35:56'
  who: Aaisha
- line: At that time, I was like, “Okay. What else can I do that is related to this?”
    I discovered that bioinformatics is an entire field, which is the closest I can
    come to combining what I can do and what at the time I really wanted to do. This
    was a nice mesh of my obsession at the time and what I could actually do. Then
    I was like, “Okay. Well, I really want to do this long term.” Bioinformatics was
    one of the things that just kind of stuck around – one of these obsessions that
    just stuck around. [chuckles]

- line: I'm really curious about… for example, you said you wanted to do research
    and that you studied but then you realized you don't want to do research. How
    do you stay motivated when learning by yourself? Because I imagine – for me, at
    least, I quite often need an external push coming from somewhere when I'm not
    motivated to actually keep learning. If I don't do this, then I just don’t do
    anything. So how do you keep yourself motivated when you learn by yourself when
    you don't have this external push? All your motivation is coming from you. How
    do you do this?
  sec: 2215
  time: '36:55'
  who: Alexey

    When I'm demotivated, I just set up something like, “Okay, I have to finish this
    at this point.”
  sec: 2261

  who: Aaisha

  sec: 2275
  time: '37:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I set the deadlines myself, yeah. I think, to some degree, being homeschooled
    might have helped with this. I've never had much of an external factor to keep
    me going. It’s been like, “Okay. Well, you have to do this at some point, so just
    pick a date and that date cannot move.” Even if I have to stay up to 2 AM, I have
    to finish it because of the deadline.
  sec: 2787
  time: 37:567
  who: Aaisha
- line: I just set my deadlines and then I try to plan them as best I can. Honestly,
    even if something very big comes up, the deadlines do not move. If I've been lazy
    one week, I can't say, “Okay, I'll push the deadline one week because I didn't
    do anything.” I'll just have to do it then. So I think that the “Oh, goodness,
    the deadline is almost here,” is my motivation. [laughs]
  sec: 2787
  time: 37:567
  who: Aaisha
- line: That requires a lot of discipline if you set the deadlines yourself. [Aaisha
    agrees] That's really cool. When you have a deadline and you know, “Okay, I have
    to do this.” But then this deadline is not real, kind of. I'm still trying to
    understand. It probably wouldn't work for me. Maybe, I don't know. [chuckles]
  sec: 2320
  time: '38:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know. I think at some point, I’ll write my deadlines and I have a
    sticker on my computer (a digital one, obviously) and I just write in big bold
    letters to the point where it annoys me. And I cannot remove it until I finish
    it. It's mostly just bullying my brain into like, “Okay, you just have to do this
    now. Stop being lazy.” I don't think I'm very organized with my time. I should
    be better at it. Sometimes I will waste an entire week doing nothing much. But
    I'm like, “Okay. Well, let's not mess up this one deadline. Let's just stop messing
    around and do the work.” I think there are ups and downs. I won't say I'm the
    most organized or the most self-disciplined person but it works for me. So it's
    fine. I get the work done eventually. [chuckles] It also helps that I switch between
    lots of different things. If I'm bored of one thing and I'm sick of doing it,
    then I can just switch to the next thing. I run things in parallel. Therefore,
    I have an escape like “Okay, I’m sick of doing data science. Let's go illustrate
    something instead.”
  sec: 2348
  time: '39:08'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I see. Yeah, that's cool. The mushroom is really cool. I wanted to ask about
    the Zoomcamp. In the Machine Learning Zoomcamp, we had some deadlines. I guess
    it was helpful for you, right? The deadlines were external. At least for me, that
    would be much, much more helpful than the deadlines I would set for myself.
  sec: 2417
  time: '40:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, the deadlines were helpful. At some point, I was ignoring the midterm
    project because I didn't want to do it. I was bored and I was studying other stuff.
    I only began in the second week. So I thought “I should do this now because I'm
    running out of time.” And I did run out of time because I got stuck. And then
    I finished it. I think I submitted it the Sunday before. I got up early on Sunday
    and was working the entire Sunday. I was like, “Okay, maybe I shouldn't have ignored
    this for all of the first week.” But having a deadline, it was like, “Okay, I
    gotta get this done.” I might have skipped it otherwise. But I wanted to stay
    on the leaderboard. I couldn’t skip this project. [chuckles]

    for that? Time tracking tools, goal setting tools?
  sec: 2522
  time: '42:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. I don't take notes because I forget to read them and I forget to pay attention
    if I'm making notes. I know notes are something that will help me. If I do forget
    things, I just rewatch it or google it instead, because notes have never worked
    for me. As far as time tracking tools and stuff go – No, I don't use them. It’s
    just like, “Okay, I have a deadline.” But before the deadline, I just mess around
    and do whatever.
  sec: 2547

    some days, I will just do one thing in the day – focus on one thing. Whatever
    my mood is for that day, that’s what I end up doing. But I don't really use any
    structural tools or anything.

  sec: 2593
  time: '43:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I tried taking notes because everyone says “Notes are your key to success.
    If you don't take notes, you never learn properly.” So I was like, “Okay. Well,
    I gotta take notes now.” And I couldn't. I would forget to pay attention to what
    I'm listening to. I end up listening to the entire lecture and I haven’t actually
    heard a word of it. I will forget to take them anyway. I wouldn't ever read my
    notes. I would forget what the notes mean. So notes just never worked for me.

- line: Are there any drawbacks to self-studying? Let's say we compare the Zoomcamp,
    where deadlines are external – they are forced on to you – versus self-studying,
    when you find material online and you learn it at your own pace. What are some
    of the drawbacks to this approach, when it's completely self-studying – completely
    based on your own motivation and discipline?
  sec: 2630
  time: '43:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think one of the drawbacks could be the same motivation/discipline thing.
    It's easier to not fulfill deadlines when you are the one setting them and nobody
    else is responsible for them. Also, I think it can be a bit harder to make sure
    you are learning the correct things on your own. You could end up wasting time
    or resources studying something where down the line, you think, “Okay, I shouldn't
    have done that.” Whereas if you're following a course or a system somebody else
    made, you're like, “Okay, these are people in the industry. Obviously, they know
    what is more beneficial to study at a given time.” They have the resources compiled
    in a way that is obviously a lot easier, and maybe to some degree more efficient.
  sec: 2660
  time: '44:20'
  who: Aaisha
- line: There's a higher chance of making a mistake when you're doing it yourself,
    because before you study, you don't know anything about that thing. Then afterwards,
    you can be like, “Okay, hindsight is 20/20. I shouldn't have done that.” At this
    point, because I am doing all the self-study, I think its benefits outweigh the
    cons. The freedom you get and it works a lot better for me personally. But obviously,
    it may not be for everybody. There are things that are maybe better when following
    a structured study program.

    a social person. I don't like doing things with others. [chuckles] I'm fine on
    my own. But I know for others it is vastly helpful. Lots of people have said that
    study groups give them motivation and stuff to self-study. I think for people
    that are of that personality, it would be very helpful for them, maybe. But personally,
    I don't like them.
  sec: 2746
  time: '45:46'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Maybe another thing that study groups help with is the deadlines. As a group,
    you set up the deadlines, and then you work through a course even if these courses
    are self-paced. Then you’re working in a small cohort, sort of.
  sec: 2771

- line: I don't know. I kind of like both. I didn't have any particular preference
    either way. I didn’t much like the MLOps cloud part, with Kubernetes and Docker
    because I don't like it as much. I don't want to focus on the MLOps part. Obviously,
    I know it's necessary if you're going into this role, but I prefer working with
    code without any worry of how to get it running in deployment. The way it was
    handled in the Zoomcamp, I actually thought was a lot more difficult from what
    I had seen briefly out of the Zoomcamp. I thought that maybe it’s not so bad after
    I'd done it. But especially before we reached those modules, I was like, “Oh,
    goodness, we have to do Docker.” Because I was very much daunted by the fact that
    Docker is this huge thing. I thought “Okay, it's not so bad. It's fine. I can
    do this.” But I think those are probably my least favorite segments, especially
    the Kubernetes.

    now, for example, in the self-paced mode?

  sec: 2983
  time: '49:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know. I’ve never really thought that much about doing it. I was just
    like, “Okay, I'm doing this.” I did find the Slack community really helpful. Using
    the Slack community not just for asking questions – because to be honest, I didn't
    use it as much as I preferred Googling instead of asking on Slack – but even just
    reading it. If anybody is stuck, help them. Because in trying to help them, you
    realize that, “Okay, I never understood this as well as I thought I did.” If you're
    helping them with things, you can further your own understanding. I think that
    was the one thing maybe I could give as a tip.
  sec: 2986
  time: '49:46'
  who: Aaisha
- line: That's a good tip. I think, at least for me, teaching is the best way of learning
    something. When I can explain a concept, then I am fairly confident that I probably
    understand it, more or less.
  sec: 3027
  time: '50:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, because explaining in a way that somebody else understands is so much
    harder. I don't like going into Slack communities and interacting with people,
    because I don't like doing that. But I tried to make a point of doing it in this
    Zoomcamp. Grudgingly I must say that it did help me understand this better when
    I had to explain it and help other people do it.

- line: I don't know if you use it – maybe you're tired of hearing about it – but
    I want to say something about ChatGPT. What I also find useful is just talking
    to the Chatbot about a topic – just asking it questions and then making sure I
    understand it. That was very helpful. I guess for you, you said you don't really
    like study groups. But it's like having a peer.
  sec: 3062

  who: Alexey

  sec: 3090

  sec: 3093
  time: '51:33'

  sec: 3099

- header: Is it possible to use self-studying to learn high-level topics
- line: Interesting. I think we have a few questions. One question is, “How can we
    learn about advanced topics, like PhD-level courses?”
  sec: 3114
  time: '51:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that could be hard. I don't know. I'm not sure how advanced you could
    go. There are lots of postgraduate resources available online as well. You might
    have to pay for them. It’s probably more paid than free – there might not be as
    much for your sources. But I think you could go a bit with paid resources and
    reading research articles. I definitely think it is possible, but maybe harder
    than doing undergrad stuff. Because there's a lot of resources for undergrad and
    maybe not that many for PhD or whatever.
  sec: 3127
  time: '52:07'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Because I guess there is more demand for beginner-level stuff.
  sec: 3162
  time: '52:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I don't know if many people who are doing online self-study pursue that
    high level of study or not. But I think it is possible. I don't think it is impossible.
    It might just be harder to study that kind of stuff on your own.
  sec: 3167
  time: '52:47'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Also, doing PhD by yourself is probably difficult in the sense that you probably
    need an institution that helps you with research, that helps with connections,
    that helps you with access to labs or whatever.
  sec: 3184
  time: '53:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't even think it's possible to get a PhD entirely by yourself. But I've
    never really researched officially getting a PhD if you've not gone to uni or
    school before. I'm not sure how that would work.
  sec: 3201
  time: '53:21'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I’m sure you can publish a paper without being a part of an institution.
  sec: 3218
  time: '53:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think you could get to that knowledge level on your own.
  sec: 3219
  time: '53:39'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Also, if you spend time doing this, you need to live on something – you need
    to eat. Usually the university pays money. If you don't get the income you spend
    like six years doing research, it can be tricky.
  sec: 3227
  time: '53:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's the practicalities of it.
  sec: 3247
  time: '54:07'
  who: Aaisha
- line: But the main resource here is papers, right? There are not so many other resources
    that you can use. There is no Zoomcamp about some PhD level topic.
  sec: 3251
  time: '54:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I don't think so. I think papers must be the major source. You can get
    a subscription to libraries or something, where they have more in-depth stuff.
    I'm not sure how that would work because it’s not something I've heavily researched
    myself. I've never been interested in getting a PhD.
  sec: 3261
  time: '54:21'
  who: Aaisha
- line: By libraries you mean electronic libraries from Springer or Nature or?
  sec: 3281
  time: '54:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, something like a publication that can get you access to a lot more of
    the higher-level stuff.
  sec: 3287
  time: '54:47'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Like IEEE, ACM – these kinds of organizations, I guess.
  sec: 3294
  time: '54:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I'm assuming being in a uni would give you access to this. Often, if
    you have a uni email address, you can log in. I'm assuming that is the kind of
    stuff the uni already gives you access to.
  sec: 3298
  time: '54:58'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I remember having access to all these major things. I didn't have to pay for
    written articles. It's another topic for discussion, right? Why do you need to
    pay 50 euros for a three-page, four-page scientific article? Also, it’s funny
    that researchers who publish articles need to pay to publish articles. This is
    wrong on so many levels.
  sec: 3310
  time: '55:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I’m in a lot of scientific communities on Twitter and more than half
    of them are always complaining about how hard it is to just get research published.
    You’d think that scientific institutions would be more welcoming. It's new research.
    It's gonna teach more about the world. But you also need to jump like 5 billion
    hoops and pay an arm and a leg just to get your research out there. It seems like
    a very counterintuitive process.
  sec: 3335
  time: '55:35'
  who: Aaisha
- line: That's why I like this archive, where all the prints are just there. But then
    again, you have to do a lot of filtering yourself. You don't know if the paper
    from an archive is good or not.
  sec: 3362
  time: '56:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: I assume that is where some of the journal’s money goes – you get curated
    resources. There's a lot less chance of bad publications coming in those.
  sec: 3374
  time: '56:14'
  who: Aaisha
- header: Switching topics to avoid burnout
- line: Another question is related to burnout. I don't know if you ever had to deal
    with anything like that – when you cannot just study anything and all you want
    to do is watch YouTube videos with cats. Did it ever happen to you?
  sec: 3386
  time: '56:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know. I don't think so. I haven't really taken a break in a while,
    so I'm not really sure. I feel like if I stop, then maybe there'll be an issue.
    But I've just been going for a while so I have the momentum. [chuckles]
  sec: 3402
  time: '56:42'
  who: Aaisha
- line: You mentioned a few times that you like to switch between topics. One day
    you read about machine learning and then the other day you create illustrations.
    This helps, right?
  sec: 3421
  time: '57:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I switch between lots of things. Right now I switch between my bioinformatics,
    machine learning, and in my illustrations, I have two or three different projects
    I'm doing at the same time. If I get bored of one thing, I hop on to the other.
    I have a fallback route instead of doing nothing. If I were to do only one thing,
    I feel this would be a bigger issue, because I do get bored of things very easily.
    So I'm like, “Okay, I'm sick of this. I don't want to do it because I’ve been
    doing it two days in a row,” which I know is not a lot, but I just don't want
    to do it anymore. So I can work on another project. I can do something else. Then
    I have some more interest in that project a few days later.
  sec: 3435
  time: '57:15'
  who: Aaisha
- header: Aaisha’s resource recommendations
- line: Interesting. Well, I think we should be slowly wrapping up. So maybe the last
    question is, “Are there any books or other good resources that you can recommend
    to the listeners?”
  sec: 3478
  time: '57:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a hard one. [cross-talk]
  sec: 3491
  time: '58:11'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Maybe on machine learning, learning in general, bioinformatics – anything
    you'd think that would be interesting for the listeners.
  sec: 3498
  time: '58:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: For Python, I can recommend a course I’ve done, which was very interesting.
    It’s called Python for Everybody. I liked it because the person was not spending
    too long on the stuff. It was a bit fast-paced. But also, if he went a bit more
    in-depth than like, “Okay, so and so syntax – just because.” For machine learning,
    I haven't looked up that many resources as I have other stuff, but I can recommend
    the Zoomcamp and your book, because I found those helpful. [chuckles]
  sec: 3509
  time: '58:29'
  who: Aaisha
- line: I would say that they're good resources. I think I can recommend those. The
    thing is, I haven't spent a lot of time following specific resources because I
    jump between them so much. So it's hard for me to say. There are so many. I could
    dig into my resources and say. It's hard to say off the top of my mind, “That's
    a good resource.”
  sec: 3509
  time: '58:29'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Did you take any course about studying? I know that there is a course on Coursera
    called Learning to Learn or something like that. Have you ever taken anything
    like that? Or you kind of knew how to do it from your homeschooling?
  sec: 3565
  time: '59:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I haven't really taken anything. I have seen the Learning How to Learn
    course and I think I watched the introduction or something. But I was so bored
    that I just closed it. I didn't watch it any further. [chuckles]
  sec: 3579
  time: '59:39'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Okay, then. That's all we have time for today. Thanks a lot for joining us
    today for sharing your experience about self-learning. And thanks, everyone, also
    for joining us today, for listening in. I guess that's it for today.

    it.
