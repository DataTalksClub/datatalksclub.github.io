title: Accelerating The Job Hunt for The Perfect Job in Tech
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about accelerating the job hunt for the perfect job
    in tech. Today, we have a special guest, Sarah. Sarah is a data scientist and
    a certified career and interview coach. She has over six years of experience working
    in tech, working at international companies, financial companies, and startups.
    She went through a career transition herself and she also wants to support women
    (other women) in following their professional dreams.
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: That inspired her to become a certified career coach. She is on a mission
    to support more women to find the right job for them. As a career coach, she has
    been supporting women getting back to work after a career break, and women in
    transition to the data field. Today will probably talk more about that, and in
    general, about finding the perfect job. Welcome to our interview, Sarah.
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you, Alexey, for having me a guest on your channel. I'm very pleased
    to be part of it.
  sec: 232
  time: '3:52'
  who: Sarah
- header: "Sarah\u2019s background"
- line: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for accepting the invite. The questions for today's interview
    were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, for your help. Let's start. Before
    we go into our main topic of finding a good job, let's start with your background.
    I already mentioned a couple of things but maybe you can tell us more about your
    career journeys so far?
  sec: 240
  time: '4:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, sure. I have a background in computer science engineering. I studied\
    \ in Tunisia before moving to Berlin. I worked for a few years as a full stack\
    \ developer before transitioning to data science, as you said \u2013 I made a\
    \ career transition myself. Since 2018, I have been working as a data scientist\
    \ at REMERGE, which is a company for mobile app retargeting. It helps people use\
    \ mobile apps again by displaying ads."
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Sarah
- line: "I have already worked in the ad tech space but correct me if I'm wrong. Let's\
    \ say I play a game, and then something happens, and I forget about this game\
    \ \u2013 I stop playing it. Then what you do is you see me in some other app and\
    \ you say, \u201CHey, do you remember this game that you played? Come back!\u201D"
  sec: 313
  time: '5:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. Yeah, that's retargeting. That's the main area where REMERGE started.\
    \ We also started user acquisition recently (last year). That's where I started\
    \ in data science and still work at REMERGE. At the same time, after having my\
    \ first child, I decided\u2026 I was like, \u201COkay, I want to do something\
    \ during my parental leave,\u201D and so on. Because I needed to find something\
    \ for myself. That's where I started the journey into my own project, which is\
    \ Thriving Career Moms, where I started helping moms returning to work after maternity.\
    \ Then, until recently, I also started to support women in tech, or women in career\
    \ transitions, so not necessarily only moms. Yeah, that's a little bit more. [chuckles]\
    \ If you have a question about my journey, then [ask]."
  sec: 339
  time: '5:39'
  who: Sarah
- header: How Sarah became a coach and found her niche
- line: "How exactly did you realize, \u201COkay, not only do I want to help women\
    \ get back to work after a break, but I\u2019m also deciding to become a coach.\u201D\
    ? What did you do? From the moment you realized, \u201COkay, I have some knowledge\
    \ about that, and I want to share it,\u201D to actually get in your first mentee?\
    \ What was that journey like?"
  sec: 405
  time: '6:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. The secret there is \u2013 I have been having the support of a coach\
    \ along my journey. When I decided to transition to data science, I joined a community.\
    \ There, I got the support on how to go through my career transition. At the same\
    \ time\u2026 Also, another time, when I decided to start my own project, I got\
    \ the help of that same community, which is Classy Career Girl. I followed the\
    \ steps. I was like, \u201CI\u2019ll take the first action and then \u2013 okay,\
    \ here's some opportunity. Let me have a membership.\u201D And then \u201COkay,\
    \ not a membership. Let's do something else.\u201D So I kept trying, doing different\
    \ things, and with the support of my coach, through the support of my community,\
    \ where I belong, I could really come up with a product or service and start career\
    \ coaching and having my own mentees. Yeah."
  sec: 434
  time: '7:14'
  who: Sarah
- line: "When it comes to figuring out what the niche where you can help is \u2013\
    \ at the beginning, did you already know what exactly you want to help with? Or\
    \ was it something you needed to work out and understand and eventually\u2026?"
  sec: 498
  time: '8:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I understand.
  sec: 516
  time: '8:36'
  who: Sarah
- line: "So you said \u201COkay, I want to help moms.\u201D Right?"
  sec: 518
  time: '8:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I think that\u2019s a process that I'm still going through, even today,\
    \ because you keep [thinking], \u201COkay, now is this the right niche? Is this?\u201D\
    \ However, I knew that I wanted to support women from the beginning. For example,\
    \ I want to support other women because I have my [challenges] from my own journey\
    \ \u2013 I know that we face certain challenges. I feel called to support women.\
    \ But then, okay, is it moms? Is it women in tech? Is it women transitioning to\
    \ data? I'm still working on this step by step, with small steps. [chuckles]"
  sec: 520
  time: '8:40'
  who: Sarah
- header: "Sarah\u2019s clients"
- line: What are the most common things that your clients come to you with? What kind
    of problems do they have that they need your help with?
  sec: 567
  time: '9:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Usually, they are looking for a new job or I also help those who started\
    \ a new job \u2013 so they started a new job, but they don't have a specific goal.\
    \ I supported them in the first month. But most of them are career changers and\
    \ looking for a new job."
  sec: 582
  time: '9:42'
  who: Sarah
- line: Which is exactly the topic for today's interview.
  sec: 605
  time: '10:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah. We talked about that in our networking lunch. That's why the idea
    came forth. [chuckles]
  sec: 607
  time: '10:07'
  who: Sarah
- line: "For those\u2026 There is a bit of a story. We met, I think it was in November,\
    \ in Berlin. At DataTalks.Club, we have regular meetings \u2013 breakfasts, lunches,\
    \ and dinners \u2013 and we met at one of these lunches (one of these meetings).\
    \ Interestingly, along with Sarah, there was her client."
  sec: 616
  time: '10:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 642
  time: '10:42'
  who: Sarah
- line: '[chuckles] That, for me, was super interesting. That''s why we are talking
    [about that] right now. It took some time to arrange everything. It was a really
    interesting lunch.'
  sec: 643
  time: '10:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's also a career transfer to data.
  sec: 656
  time: '10:56'
  who: Sarah
- header: How Sarah helps her clients find the perfect job
- line: Yeah. Clients come to you and ask you to help them with finding a new job.
    So what happens after you have the first call? How exactly do you help them to
    find this perfect job for their ambitions?
  sec: 659
  time: '10:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. So the way I help them is by taking them through the process, which
    consists of four pillars. The first pillar is about the job search, so helping
    them set clear goals about their ideal job description. We see jobs online, but
    which jobs are you really interested in doing? What problems are you interested
    in solving? What's your vision for the near future? That's the thing that we go
    through first. Then, it's about having a networking strategy and knowing which
    people you are going to reach out to, so that you increase your chances for a
    referral. [It helps you to] know about the right opportunities.
  sec: 679
  time: '11:19'
  who: Sarah
- line: "Then, it's about the resume and interview preparation, which is about how\
    \ to tailor your resume, how to use the correct keywords, and how to show the\
    \ value that you provide to the company. Then, how can you express that in interviews?\
    \ This means preparing for the top questions. For example, \u201CWhy are you applying\
    \ to this company? What makes you interested in applying here? Why are you leaving\
    \ your job? Why did you change your career?\u201D And so on. Then, the fourth\
    \ pillar is the job search strategy, which is about the main job search activities.\
    \ That one is going to enter an early stage job."
  sec: 679
  time: '11:19'
  who: Sarah
- line: "This sounds like it's not really specific to data science\u2014it applies\
    \ to all sorts of jobs, right? [Sarah agrees] If we talk about data, this can\
    \ be data analysts, data engineers, whatever, right? It's very broad. Four pillars.\
    \ Okay. You said the first pillar is job search\u2026 Okay, four pillars: job\
    \ search, networking strategy, CV and interview preparation and job search strategy\u2026\
    \ [chuckles] Are the first and the last one the same?"
  sec: 796
  time: '13:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Okay. [chuckles] Let's\u2026 [chuckles] I\u2019m just wondering, because\
    \ I think those are the questions that\u2026 I don't know if you have the same\
    \ document that I have, just because I remember that I changed it a little bit\
    \ so we can really focus on the\u2026"
  sec: 831
  time: '13:51'
  who: Sarah
- line: "Okay, I'm a bit\u2026 I\u2019m not following the document. For those who\
    \ edit this episode later, please cut this out. [chuckles] For those listening,\
    \ bear with us. So, you prefer to follow the questions, right?"
  sec: 855
  time: '14:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 868
  time: '14:28'
  who: Sarah
- line: "Yeah. Okay. So, we talked about these four pillars right. You said that the\
    \ first thing is job search, right? You need to have a clear idea\u2026 You need\
    \ to know what your ideal job is."
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first pillar is the job description, yeah. The ideal job.
  sec: 884
  time: '14:44'
  who: Sarah
- line: "And which jobs are interesting for you \u2013 where you want to be in the\
    \ future. So how do you know whether a job description is 100% aligned with my\
    \ ambition? [How do you know whether] this job that I'm looking at right now is\
    \ right for me?"
  sec: 887
  time: '14:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think that's one thing that all my clients who come to me think about.\
    \ They know what they are looking for. For example, to be concrete, let's say\
    \ I'm looking for a data scientist job. But then, data scientists can do many\
    \ things, right? Even the titles are different. You can find for example, a \u201C\
    decision making scientist,\u201D you can find an \u201Capplied research scientist,\u201D\
    \ and all of them can be put under \u201Cdata science\u201D. So, the first step\
    \ that I help them to figure out is that and how to know whether this is the right\
    \ alignment."
  sec: 907
  time: '15:07'
  who: Sarah
- line: "[We solve this] by knowing what skills you want to develop right now. You\
    \ first go about this by researching. What we do is first research all these data\
    \ science jobs. You look at an online advertisement, and then find some tasks\
    \ that you enjoy \u2013 that you're interested in doing. We start to collect them,\
    \ \u201COkay, I like to do these tasks and these I don\u2019t. I'm interested\
    \ in learning about this technology, and not this technology.\u201D This is part\
    \ of researching the job description. But it\u2019s not only that. The other thing\
    \ is connecting with people who are [already] doing the job. So let's say I found\u2026\
    \ the last time I found Flink, so that's my example. [chuckles] Flink had a job\
    \ advertisement for a data scientist, and I see whether there are any people that\
    \ I can connect with who work at the company, or are currently working at Flink."
  sec: 907
  time: '15:07'
  who: Sarah
- line: "Then I can ask them, \u201CHow is it to work there? What do you do on a day-to-day\
    \ basis? This helps to discover the alignment, exactly \u2013 by going through\
    \ the process of researching, talking, and doing informational interviews. This\
    \ is a strategy that I really like because it gives you another perspective. I\
    \ used it myself when I was doing my career transition. Even as I look at how\
    \ I want to grow further in my position, I do informational interviews with different\
    \ people so that I can figure out what the thing that is right for me would be."
  sec: 907
  time: '15:07'
  who: Sarah
- line: I'm sidetracking a bit again.
  sec: 1067
  time: '17:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it's fine. [chuckles]
  sec: 1071
  time: '17:51'
  who: Sarah
- header: Finding a specialization
- line: "I hope it\u2019s fine. [chuckles] The problem that I personally have\u2026\
    \ Not me personally, but the problem that\u2026 Let me take a step back. In our\
    \ community, we have courses. Right now we have three courses \u2013 three different\
    \ courses \u2013 ML engineering course, data engineering course, and ML Ops course."
  sec: 1072
  time: '17:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: "While the first and the last one are kind of similar, the data engineering\
    \ course is quite different. It's a different kind of job, right? So people take\
    \ all these courses \u2013 they take the data engineering course, the ML engineering\
    \ course, and they say, \u201COkay, I like all the courses.\u201D"
  sec: 1072
  time: '17:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: All of them.
  sec: 1107
  time: '18:27'
  who: Sarah
- line: All of them.
  sec: 1109
  time: '18:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: What's the third? ML engineering, data engineering and the third?
  sec: 1110
  time: '18:30'
  who: Sarah
- line: ML Ops.
  sec: 1113
  time: '18:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: ML Ops, okay.
  sec: 1115
  time: '18:35'
  who: Sarah
- line: "Then the students come and say, \u201CWe took the courses, and we like all\
    \ of them. I want to do ALL of this stuff.\u201D And this is a lot. You cannot\u2026\
    \ You can, but it's difficult to be a jack of all trades, right? Especially if\
    \ you're on the start in your career. You need to figure out from these directions,\
    \ where exactly you want to go."
  sec: 1116
  time: '18:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: "What sometimes happens is, the students just apply to everything. They apply\
    \ to data engineering positions, ML Ops positions, ML engineering positions \u2013\
    \ all of them. I am not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing. Maybe you can\
    \ tell us. But I think one of the consequences of that is that you kind of lose\
    \ focus, right?"
  sec: 1116
  time: '18:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly.
  sec: 1164
  time: '19:24'
  who: Sarah
- line: "So how, in this situation, when there are so many options\u2026 If I try\
    \ to focus them, it means that I am kind of\u2026 How do I say this? Losing opportunities.\
    \ I have this fear of missing out, that if I don't apply to data engineering positions,\
    \ then there\u2019s a very big chunk of potential jobs that I will not get, because\
    \ I don't apply to them. Right? If I only apply to ML engineering positions. In\
    \ this case, how can I actually understand which one is better, and what is better\
    \ for me?"
  sec: 1166
  time: '19:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. The first thing. Taking all the courses to explore is good because\
    \ one doesn't have experience in the field, so exploring different specializations\
    \ is a good way to start. But what I would suggest doing before starting the courses\u2026\
    \ I will talk about those who already did the courses. [chuckles] But before doing\
    \ the courses and starting to apply for jobs \u2013 take some time and reflect\
    \ on your profile. What skills do you have? What do you have as strengths? What\
    \ do you have as qualifications, of course? Qualifications, strengths, skills\
    \ \u2013 and then, what experience do you have? Taking all of these into consideration,\
    \ in addition to them, your interests as well."
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Sarah
- line: "This allows you to better leverage, \u201COkay, I have my profile. Now, which\
    \ one of these \u2013 data engineering, ML Ops, or ML engineer \u2013 would be\
    \ the one that works for me?\u201D First, I would be applying the skills that\
    \ I would enjoy, and I can become good at them because I enjoy doing this. Then\
    \ I can become good at it. So which ones fit better based on my experience as\
    \ well? So it\u2019s a combination of your profile \u2013 what makes you unique?\
    \ What makes you, you? And then, from there, let's research these positions. What\
    \ does a data engineer do? What does ML Ops do? What does an ML engineer do? Once\
    \ I do that, then I choose one of these. Now it's time to address, \u201COkay,\
    \ but I'm not sure yet. I don't have much experience in it. All of them sound\
    \ interesting. I want to work with data.\u201D"
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Sarah
- line: "Many people say \u201CI just want to work with data. I\u2019m interested\
    \ in working with data.\u201D What I would advise them to do is to still try to\
    \ choose a focus. Okay, choose a focus, but how do you choose it? Try to look\
    \ at the job market. If all of them are interesting to you, then look at the job\
    \ market. What does the job market say? Are they hiring data engineers more? Are\
    \ they hiring more ML Ops? What's your target salary? The target environment?\
    \ Study it from the point of the job market. This will help to filter. For example,\
    \ \u201CFrom those, it sounds like I like the data engineering [jobs], with my\
    \ skills and my profile, what I want to do in the work environment, the job market,\
    \ and so on \u2013 this one fits better.\u201D From there, choose a focus. Now\
    \ I want to answer the question of why a focus is not going to make you lose opportunities.\
    \ Because when you focus, you simply give yourself the opportunity to grow your\
    \ skills in that specific area. A mistake I made myself when I decided to change\
    \ to data science \u2013 I have the background of a full stack developer and I\
    \ worked with Java, I worked with backend, frontend\u2026 And I decided to move\
    \ to Berlin."
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Sarah
- line: "I knew I wanted to be in data science, but it still wasn't clear for me.\
    \ Okay, data science, ML engineer, data scientist? It wasn't clear at that time\
    \ to me. But what I did in the beginning was start applying for all jobs \u2013\
    \ full stack developer, back end developer, backend engineer, software engineer,\
    \ data scientist, ML engineer\u2026 And I got overwhelmed with, \u201CHow can\
    \ I prepare for the interviews for all of these? They have different requirements.\
    \ A data scientist job would require other skills compared to a full-stack developer.\
    \ A data engineer would require more skills than a data scientist. Although they\
    \ can have intersection samples, the main focus would be different from data science\
    \ data engineering [roles].\u201D So I was getting lost. I was not getting any\
    \ opportunities to have interviews \u2013 rejections, \u201CWhat can I do?\u201D\
    \ and so on, until I narrowed down my focus. That's when I started to become more\
    \ confident, more ready for the interviews. I could have a specific plan for learning.\
    \ And I started to get interviews."
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Sarah
- line: "I narrowed it down, I was like \u201Cdata scientist\u201D and I also remember\
    \ \u201CML engineer\u201D. I kept it as a data scientist and ML engineer, for\
    \ me. And that was my focus. The focus doesn't really reduce your chances. Yeah.\
    \ [chuckles] And another thing. [chuckles] Another thing is that companies want\
    \ some people that have experience. If you keep applying for all of these, in\
    \ the end, you are applying for data engineer, ML engineer, data scientist, then\
    \ the company who is hiring for a data engineer, which requires more infrastructure\
    \ and tooling and preparation of the data workflow and so on \u2013 they will\
    \ not find you having that practice of data engineering. Because you are trying\
    \ to do all of them."
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Sarah
- line: "So this means that\u2026 Let's say somebody wants to take our courses \u2013\
    \ they should do some of this work even before they take courses, right?"
  sec: 1588
  time: '26:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
  sec: 1596
  time: '26:36'
  who: Sarah
- line: "Then you have more focus from the very beginning and you know, \u201COkay,\
    \ I want to focus on data engineering so I'll take data engineering.\u201D Then,\
    \ after the course, perhaps, instead of taking the other courses, focus on developing\
    \ the skills in this area \u2013 focus on doing more projects in this area. [chuckles]\
    \ And then get interviews in that area, and try to understand where you stand,\
    \ what else is required to get the job. Hopefully, after finishing our course,\
    \ you get all the skills. [Sarah agrees] But sometimes, some companies might require\
    \ something specific that we don't cover. This is where you can understand that\
    \ and then try to focus on building a project with this particular skill."
  sec: 1598
  time: '26:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. It's important not to get lost in doing all the courses. I don't know\

    \ for a full-time position,\u201D and it stops. So I wouldn't. If I applied for\
    \ a full-time job at the first interview, I wouldn't say, \u201CI like this job,\
    \ but I want to work part-time.\u201D At least in the advances \u2013 not from\
    \ the first interview. I also know someone I helped from the beginning, she mentioned\
    \ part-time. So it depends. How much is it a priority or how negotiable is it?\
    \ But it's better to keep it full-time in the beginning."

    \ it, try to practice it \u2013 small projects, small things that you can put\
    \ on your GitHub profile. From there, maybe if you start applying\u2026 You can\

    \ people in data engineering, I start to share my learnings, and the challenges,\
    \ and so on. Then, after I finished the course, I would start applying for jobs.\
