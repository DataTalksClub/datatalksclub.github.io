short: From Hackathons To Developer Advocacy
title: From Hackathons To Developer Advocacy
transcript:
- header: 0:00 Introduction, career journeys, and video setup and workflow
- line: This week we’ll discuss many topics—developer advocacy, organizing hackathons,
    and Will’s career journey.
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m going off script because we have a special guest, Will, whose career we
    will explore today.
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: If you took our recent data engineering course, you probably know Will, a
    developer advocate at Kestra, a workflow orchestration platform. Will led module
    two on workflow orchestration.
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: Previously, Will built open source education programs to help developers make
    their first contributions to open source. He creates technical videos and documentation.
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Today, we’ll talk about his work. Welcome, Will, it’s a pleasure to have you.
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you for having me. I’m excited to dive into what you just discussed.
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Will
- line: The questions for today’s interview were prepared by Johanna Byer—thank you,
    Johanna, for your help.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: I want to go off script a bit at the start.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: We always ask about the career journey, but I really like your videos.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: During the data engineering course office hours, if you haven’t checked the
    course yet, you still can—even though it’s finishing, module two about Kestra
    is available.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: I really like the quality of your picture and all the little things in your
    background, the microphone, and the headset.
  sec: 201
  time: '3:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Tell us about your setup. How did you achieve such good picture quality?
  sec: 201
  time: '3:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: My setup has evolved slowly over the years, especially since COVID when everything
    went online and people started making nice setups. I thought that was cool.
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Will
- line: We’ll talk more about how I’ve been making videos in different forms for a
    few years.
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Will
- line: I decided to learn photography and got a Sony mirrorless camera with an HDMI
    output.
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Will
- line: I use a simple prime lens, which gives a nice blurry background. The camera
    is plugged into my laptop and appears as a webcam, making it simple.
  sec: 249
  time: '4:09'
  who: Will
- line: What makes video look good is not the camera, but the lighting.
  sec: 249
  time: '4:09'
  who: Will
- line: I have a nice light off to the side, which lights me up, and some lights behind
    me to separate me from the background.
  sec: 249
  time: '4:09'
  who: Will
- line: Because the background is at a 45-degree angle, it creates depth and makes
    it feel more professional. In reality, the camera is clamped to the back of my
    monitor, so if I shake my desk, the camera shakes too.
  sec: 274
  time: '4:34'
  who: Will
- line: The key is to make recording videos for Kestra as frictionless as possible—just
    turn the light and camera on, and I’m ready.
  sec: 274
  time: '4:34'
  who: Will
- line: The camera is right above my monitor, so when I do demos, it’s easy to look
    up at the camera and down at my work. There’s nothing in the way.
  sec: 300
  time: '5:00'
  who: Will
- line: I used to put the camera on a tripod in front of my monitor, but then I couldn’t
    see the demo, so I was always leaning around the camera—that was awful. This setup
    is simple but effective.
  sec: 300
  time: '5:00'
  who: Will
- line: Your voice comes through clearly. What microphone do you use?
  sec: 337
  time: '5:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have a Rode XLR microphone plugged into a preamp, which connects to my computer.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Will
- line: It requires a lot of power, so the closer it is to my mouth, the more radio-style
    it sounds.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Will
- line: I used to keep the microphone out of the shot, but then I lost clarity—people
    like the clarity of my voice, so I keep it closer now.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Will
- line: The big sock helps with pops and crackles, which is not nice for anyone’s
    ears.
  sec: 361
  time: '6:01'
  who: Will
- line: This keeps everything looking and sounding clean.
  sec: 361
  time: '6:01'
  who: Will
- line: The hardest thing for me is the lighting.
  sec: 391
  time: '6:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Did you experiment to achieve your current setup, or did you learn something
    specific?
  sec: 391
  time: '6:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did you position the lights?
  sec: 391
  time: '6:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Since COVID, I’ve lived in a few different places with the same desk but different
    setups.
  sec: 415
  time: '6:55'
  who: Will
- line: Normally, people think to put the light directly behind the camera or use
    a ring light, but that loses depth in your face.
  sec: 415
  time: '6:55'
  who: Will
- line: I learned from photography that having the light at a 45-degree angle creates
    nice contours and shadows, adding depth.
  sec: 415
  time: '6:55'
  who: Will
- line: My desk has a spot right next to where my microphone is clamped, next to my
    monitor.
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Will
- line: It’s cramped, but it works.
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Will
- line: I’ve moved the light left and right, and this position lights me up without
    washing me out.
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Will
- line: I have a window next to the light, and I used to use natural light, but it’s
    not reliable, especially in winter when it gets dark at 3 p.m.
  sec: 464
  time: '7:44'
  who: Will
- line: Now I close the blind and use artificial light, so I can record at any time
    of day.
  sec: 464
  time: '7:44'
  who: Will
- line: In London, you probably have even less light than we do in Berlin.
  sec: 482
  time: '8:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. If I open the blind, it lights the background more but puts me in
    shadow.
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Will
- line: It’s important to use artificial light so you know what you’ll get from your
    video every time.
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Will
- line: There’s nothing worse than one video looking great because the natural light
    was perfect, and another looking dark because the sun set.
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Will
- line: This setup is the most reliable. I’ve had this equipment for a few years,
    and it works well.
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Will
- line: I could add another light, but I like the simplicity.
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Will
- line: If people think it looks good, I don’t see a reason to change it.
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Will
- line: Your hobby in photography helped you set up the lights and everything.
  sec: 542
  time: '9:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I used to think photography was about buying a lens with a wide aperture
    for a blurry background.
  sec: 547
  time: '9:07'
  who: Will
- line: I learned quickly that lighting is the main thing—the blurry background is
    nice, but lighting makes it look good.
  sec: 547
  time: '9:07'
  who: Will
- line: I didn’t have a light for a while, and the videos looked better with one.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Will
- line: A lot of people could get away with just a webcam and a light, and the quality
    would improve.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Will
- line: It’s not all about the camera—the camera helps, but once you pump it through
    Zoom, you probably won’t notice much difference over a decent webcam.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Will
- line: Not mine, but Macs usually have good webcams. My Windows laptop is powerful,
    but the camera is not great. Anyway, most laptops, especially Macs, do have good
    cameras.
  sec: 588
  time: '9:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: We got off script—amazing setup, thanks for telling us.
  sec: 615
  time: '10:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m tempted to ask about the Lego in your background, but we don’t have time
    for that.
  sec: 615
  time: '10:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you’re listening to the podcast and don’t see the video, check YouTube
    to see why I asked Will about his setup—it looks very professional.
  sec: 615
  time: '10:15'
  who: Alexey
- header: '10:41 From hackathons to open source: Early experiences and learning'
- line: Back to the podcast. The usual question I always ask at the beginning is for
    the guest to tell us about their career journey.
  sec: 641
  time: '10:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did you start? What did you do to get to where you are now?
  sec: 641
  time: '10:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: It all started just before 2018, when I was deciding what to study at university.
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Will
- line: I had done some programming, but I wasn’t completely sure I wanted to make
    it my career.
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Will
- line: Engineering was also appealing, so I was weighing my options between the two.
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Will
- line: I got really into programming during a school module and decided that computer
    science sounded interesting.
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Will
- line: So, I chose to study computer science at university.
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Will
- line: I thought I would find my niche and become a software developer, like most
    people who take that path.
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Will
- line: What changed things was getting involved with hackathons.
  sec: 706
  time: '11:46'
  who: Will
- line: I hadn’t really heard much about them before, but I really enjoyed them and
    ended up going to five in my first year.
  sec: 706
  time: '11:46'
  who: Will
- line: Later, I got involved in organizing hackathons in my second and third years.
  sec: 706
  time: '11:46'
  who: Will
- line: From there, I joined organizations that helped run hackathons.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Will
- line: During COVID, these organizations started building programs to help students
    contribute to open source, since many lost their internships.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Will
- line: This allowed students to gain valuable experience by contributing to large
    open source projects.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Will
- line: What started as a 12-week summer contract turned into part-time work while
    I finished my degree, then into a full-time job for about three years.
  sec: 736
  time: '12:16'
  who: Will
- line: This was not what I expected when I started university—I thought I’d be a
    programmer, but I ended up in a different, though still technical, role.
  sec: 736
  time: '12:16'
  who: Will
- line: After several years running open source programs, I still had the urge to
    move into a more technical role.
  sec: 762
  time: '12:42'
  who: Will
- line: My work was focused on helping others do technical things and teaching entry-level
    skills.
  sec: 762
  time: '12:42'
  who: Will
- line: The idea of developer advocacy came up often, and I met people in that field
    through hackathons.
  sec: 762
  time: '12:42'
  who: Will
- line: I started looking into developer advocacy and asked people I met for advice
    on how to transition.
  sec: 794
  time: '13:14'
  who: Will
- line: That’s when I connected with Kestra—Anna, our product lead, and I met on LinkedIn.
  sec: 794
  time: '13:14'
  who: Will
- line: We had a chat, and I learned more about Kestra and what it does.
  sec: 794
  time: '13:14'
  who: Will
- line: Part of the reason for hiring a developer advocate was to clarify what Kestra
    is, which wasn’t very clear at the time.
  sec: 818
  time: '13:38'
  who: Will
- line: I’ve now been in this role for a year as of last week, and it’s been amazing
    to continue the work I loved in open source while also doing more technical demos
    and teaching.
  sec: 818
  time: '13:38'
  who: Will
- line: Congratulations on your work anniversary.
  sec: 843
  time: '14:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you.
  sec: 845
  time: '14:05'
  who: Will
- line: We’ll definitely talk more about developer advocacy, but I’m curious about
    your hackathon experience.
  sec: 849
  time: '14:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Would you recommend that first-year university students do as many hackathons
    as possible, or should they focus more on their studies?
  sec: 849
  time: '14:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: The most valuable things I learned in my first year were at hackathons.
  sec: 861
  time: '14:21'
  who: Will
- line: For example, I learned how to actually use Git, deal with merge conflicts,
    and get things merged so they work.
  sec: 861
  time: '14:21'
  who: Will
- line: At university, we touched on Git, but never really understood it.
  sec: 861
  time: '14:21'
  who: Will
- line: That skill has been very helpful in my career.
  sec: 861
  time: '14:21'
  who: Will
- line: At hackathons, we worked as a team and had to get everything merged quickly,
    so I learned those things fast.
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Will
- line: I also learned how to build real projects, which many of my peers at university
    struggled with.
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Will
- line: Often, they understood the concepts but didn’t know how to combine them into
    a working program and deploy it.
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Will
- line: Hackathons taught me real-life engineering skills that university didn’t cover.
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Will
- line: That said, I wouldn’t say university was a waste of time.
  sec: 940
  time: '15:40'
  who: Will
- line: A lot of the theory is useful for giving you a grounding that self-taught
    coders might not have.
  sec: 940
  time: '15:40'
  who: Will
- line: Even if you don’t use everything, it’s helpful to have that context.
  sec: 940
  time: '15:40'
  who: Will
- header: 16:04 Becoming a hackathon organizer and the value of soft skills
- line: So hackathons were definitely useful—100% would recommend.
  sec: 964
  time: '16:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did you actually start organizing them?
  sec: 964
  time: '16:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: You said you took part in five during your first year and learned a lot, but
    organizing is quite different from participating.
  sec: 964
  time: '16:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: What did you learn from becoming an organizer?
  sec: 964
  time: '16:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: After doing five hackathons in my first year, I definitely felt a bit burned
    out.
  sec: 1016
  time: '16:56'
  who: Will
- line: I got to know the people who organized my local hackathon and became part
    of that core group.
  sec: 1016
  time: '16:56'
  who: Will
- line: They asked if I wanted to get involved, and I saw it as a chance to help others
    and fill in gaps I’d noticed.
  sec: 1016
  time: '16:56'
  who: Will
- line: It was valuable to help more people and learn new skills.
  sec: 1040
  time: '17:20'
  who: Will
- line: People often say that hackathon organizers get a step up in their careers
    because they learn useful skills beyond programming.
  sec: 1040
  time: '17:20'
  who: Will
- line: Working with others and developing soft skills is very valuable when you’re
    part of a team.
  sec: 1040
  time: '17:20'
  who: Will
- line: The stereotype is that developers don’t have the best soft skills, though
    I don’t think that’s always true.
  sec: 1090
  time: '18:10'
  who: Will
- line: Anything you can do to work on those skills is definitely a win.
  sec: 1090
  time: '18:10'
  who: Will
- line: The set of skills is different—if you spend time organizing, you might not
    develop the same technical depth as someone practicing algorithms.
  sec: 1097
  time: '18:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I moved from hands-on data science to organizing courses and events,
    I felt less technical.
  sec: 1097
  time: '18:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Do you think it’s a problem to lose technical skills as you move into organizing
    and teaching?
  sec: 1097
  time: '18:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: That was something I worried about when working on the MLH Fellowship and
    open source programs.
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Will
- line: The longer I spent working on them, the less technical I felt.
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Will
- line: At first, I was content because helping others is rewarding, but over time
    I felt a gap—I wouldn’t know how to do something difficult if asked.
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Will
- line: When I started organizing hackathons, I didn’t think much about it because
    I knew so little then.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Will
- line: But after doing it as a career, I definitely felt something was missing, which
    is part of why I moved to developer advocacy.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Will
- line: Even in developer advocacy, there’s a risk of working on tools that aren’t
    very technical or are too niche.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Will
- line: What I like about Kestra is that it’s such a versatile product—I get to touch
    everything, not just one specific area of tech.
  sec: 1241
  time: '20:41'
  who: Will
- line: 'It’s a difficult balance, and you have to figure out what you value more:
    being super technical or helping others become technical. It depends on what matters
    most to you.'
  sec: 1241
  time: '20:41'
  who: Will
- line: I guess developer advocacy is a good blend of both technical and non-technical
    work.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can see if you enjoy doing technical work more and slowly move in that
    direction.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, at Kestra, you could start contributing more to the internal
    product rather than focusing only on documentation, if that's possible.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Or, if you enjoy non-technical work more, you could focus on community activities,
    talking to users, collecting feedback, and similar things.It's a nice blend of
    both technical and non-technical work.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely. The beauty of Kestra being such a small company is that every
    month is a bit different. With the open source program, we ran three a year, so
    it became very routine—twelve weeks for the program, a gap, then another program.
  sec: 1322
  time: '22:02'
  who: Will
- line: Some people loved that routine, and I liked it at first, especially when the
    economy was good and companies wanted to spend money on these initiatives. We
    created new courses, like a production engineering course and a web3 course, which
    was exciting.
  sec: 1322
  time: '22:02'
  who: Will
- line: But what I like about Kestra is that I'm not just writing documentation every
    month.
  sec: 1322
  time: '22:02'
  who: Will
- line: For example, we did the Zoomcamp in January, which was very different from
    what I was doing in March. If I worked at a bigger company with a large developer
    advocacy team, I might have a more specialized area. Here, the variety allows
    me to do more technical work if I want, or focus on community-oriented work if
    I prefer. It's a nice blend, and I can lean into one or the other as I like.
  sec: 1322
  time: '22:02'
  who: Will
- header: 23:18 How to organize a hackathon, memorable projects, and creativity
- line: I still see you helping our course participants—your user picture is still
    in our Slack. Thank you for doing that.
  sec: 1398
  time: '23:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I want to go back to hackathons. Let's say I want to organize a hackathon—actually,
    this is not hypothetical, because we want to organize one in DataTalks Club.
  sec: 1398
  time: '23:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: How do you actually do this? What should I consider? What are the moving parts?
    How do you come up with ideas? I want to organize one, but I have no idea what
    to do.
  sec: 1398
  time: '23:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: A hackathon has a few key parts. The first is the building part, where participants
    actually build their projects. The other key part is the demo or presentation.
  sec: 1445
  time: '24:05'
  who: Will
- line: When I was a student, our hackathons were usually 24 hours, with one overnight.
  sec: 1445
  time: '24:05'
  who: Will
- line: You would either demo on stage, or there would be a science fair style setup
    with tables and judges walking around.
  sec: 1445
  time: '24:05'
  who: Will

    or organize catering.

- line: I did more online hackathons, especially after the pandemic started.
  sec: 1482
  time: '24:42'
  who: Will
- line: For online events, having a good community space is important. You have Slack,
    which is great, and Discord is also popular.
  sec: 1482
  time: '24:42'
  who: Will
- line: We used to run lots of online workshops during hackathons, but now there are
    so many resources available that engagement is low.
  sec: 1506
  time: '25:06'
  who: Will
- line: Instead, it's better to be helpful in Slack and host office hours where people
    can discuss their ideas. That’s more useful than running lots of workshops.
  sec: 1506
  time: '25:06'
  who: Will
- line: On Sunday, you have the judging part, which is the hardest part to organize,
    especially online.
  sec: 1526
  time: '25:26'
  who: Will
- line: You can either organize judging and announce winners in real time, which is
    stressful, or announce winners later, but then you might lose engagement because
    people move on.
  sec: 1526
  time: '25:26'
  who: Will
- line: For judging, there are matrices online for different categories, and you can
    weight judges' scores to get a fair result.
  sec: 1526
  time: '25:26'
  who: Will
- line: If there’s a tie, you can discuss and decide.
  sec: 1526
  time: '25:26'
  who: Will
- line: I liked having categories at hackathons.
  sec: 1574
  time: '26:14'
  who: Will
- line: Most hackathons are open-ended, but if you get sponsors, you can have a category
    like "Best Use of Sponsor Technology."
  sec: 1574
  time: '26:14'
  who: Will
- line: That was one way I enjoyed hackathons—I would look at the sponsors, try their
    tools, and maybe win a prize.
  sec: 1574
  time: '26:14'
  who: Will
- line: I learned new things and sometimes won cool prizes. I would pick a sponsor
    tool, think of an idea that uses it well, and try to catch the judges’ attention.
  sec: 1600
  time: '26:40'
  who: Will
- line: I enjoyed that approach. Open-ended prizes can be overwhelming because there
    are so many possibilities.
  sec: 1600
  time: '26:40'
  who: Will
- line: People often think they’ll build the next Facebook, but then they run out
    of time and only have a login page that doesn’t work.
  sec: 1600
  time: '26:40'
  who: Will
- line: When you were a participant, you looked at the sponsors and their tools, then
    thought about what you could do with them. It sounds like the problems were open-ended,
    and the hackathon was just about doing something cool with the available tools.
  sec: 1649
  time: '27:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Was it like that, or did you have a theme or some direction?
  sec: 1649
  time: '27:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, the problem is that if there are no constraints, people don’t know
    what to do and the time runs out. How do you deal with this?
  sec: 1649
  time: '27:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Open-ended hackathons work well for in-person events because people are committed—they’ve
    shown up and there’s free food, so they stay.
  sec: 1719
  time: '28:39'
  who: Will
- line: For online hackathons, it’s harder to keep engagement. If things aren’t going
    well, people can just leave, since there’s no real consequence.
  sec: 1719
  time: '28:39'
  who: Will
- line: Some events have categories like "Best Use of Data" or "Best AI Project."
    These are broad enough to allow creativity but give some focus. Others are completely
    open-ended, and you can use sponsor tools.
  sec: 1745
  time: '29:05'
  who: Will
- line: One prize I won was for "Hackiest Hack." We didn’t aim for it, but our project
    was so barely held together that people said, "This is the most hacked-up thing
    I’ve ever seen. It’s a miracle it works."
  sec: 1745
  time: '29:05'
  who: Will
- line: That project was called Willmojis.
  sec: 1784
  time: '29:44'
  who: Will
- line: We thought it would be cool to use Microsoft’s Vision API to analyze the emotion
    in a photo.
  sec: 1784
  time: '29:44'
  who: Will
- line: Then, we used another tool to cut out my face from the photo and turn it into
    a true type font you could install on your phone or laptop.
  sec: 1784
  time: '29:44'
  who: Will
- line: When you typed the laughing emoji, it would show my face instead of the usual
    emoji—just like how iPhone and Android have different emoji styles, you could
    have a Will emoji.
  sec: 1784
  time: '29:44'
  who: Will
- line: We took a lot of photos, figured out the emotions, cut out the faces, and
    installed them as a font.
  sec: 1819
  time: '30:19'
  who: Will
- line: All the different stages barely worked together.
  sec: 1819
  time: '30:19'

    were amazed that it worked at all.
  sec: 1819
  time: '30:19'
  who: Will
- line: The idea itself was kind of crazy.
  sec: 1819
  time: '30:19'
  who: Will
- line: That is the wildest thing. How did you even come up with the idea to do this?
  sec: 1850
  time: '30:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was very random.
  sec: 1864
  time: '31:04'
  who: Will
- line: I remember Microsoft was sponsoring the hackathon and offered a Surface Go
    as a prize for the best use of Microsoft Azure. We thought that was really cool,
    so we looked into what Azure had to offer.
  sec: 1864
  time: '31:04'
  who: Will
- line: 'By that point, we had done quite a few hackathons and developed a formula
    for winning: pick a project with a clear scope that processes something and gives
    a result—nothing too complex, just something that does one thing very well.'
  sec: 1877
  time: '31:17'
  who: Will
- line: We thought it would be cool to do something with image recognition.
  sec: 1877
  time: '31:17'
  who: Will
- line: A friend had been reading about TrueType fonts and how you can create them.
  sec: 1877
  time: '31:17'
  who: Will
- line: We wondered if we could use a Linux library to generate fonts in real time
    and integrate that into our project.
  sec: 1877
  time: '31:17'
  who: Will
- line: All of us had these weird ideas, and we decided to stick them together and
    see if it worked.
  sec: 1919
  time: '31:59'
  who: Will
- line: The idea evolved as the hackathon went on.
  sec: 1919
  time: '31:59'
  who: Will
- line: We did this at Oxford University, where many people were trying to build useful
    and impactful projects.
  sec: 1919
  time: '31:59'
  who: Will
- line: Meanwhile, we were being silly with ours.
  sec: 1919
  time: '31:59'
  who: Will

    going to work."
  sec: 1919
  time: '31:59'
  who: Will
- line: But when we demoed it, everyone was surprised and said, "Okay, we take it
    back. We thought you were just messing around—we didn't realize you'd actually
    build it."
  sec: 1919
  time: '31:59'
  who: Will
- line: But you were still just messing around in the end, right?
  sec: 1959
  time: '32:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, of course.
  sec: 1961
  time: '32:41'
  who: Will
- line: But the point is to have fun, not necessarily to have a social impact at the
    end.
  sec: 1966
  time: '32:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. At a hackathon, the time is so short that it's very hard to have
    a real impact.
  sec: 1972
  time: '32:52'
  who: Will
- line: The best thing, especially as a student, is to focus on learning new things.
  sec: 1972
  time: '32:52'
  who: Will
- line: In our case, one person wanted to learn about TrueType fonts, another wanted
    to learn about Microsoft Azure, so we all came out of it feeling good because
    we got to play with new tools we hadn't used before. It worked out well.
  sec: 1972
  time: '32:52'
  who: Will

  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, Major League Hacking.
  sec: 2026
  time: '33:46'
  who: Will
- line: MLH started about 12 years ago as an organization to help students run hackathons.
  sec: 2026
  time: '33:46'
  who: Will
- line: Hackathons can be complex, with lots of moving parts, and not every university
    has experience running them. MLH would provide pre-event support and send a representative
    to the event.
  sec: 2026
  time: '33:46'
  who: Will
- line: I became friends with many MLH representatives because there weren't many
    in the UK, so I often saw the same people at different hackathons.
  sec: 2052
  time: '34:12'
  who: Will
- line: Once I started organizing, they encouraged me to apply to become a representative.
  sec: 2052
  time: '34:12'
  who: Will
- line: It sounded great—I could help more people, and travel expenses would be covered,
    which was important as a student.
  sec: 2052
  time: '34:12'
  who: Will
- line: I applied for the role at the start of 2020, when I was volunteering at many
    hackathons and judging projects in the UK.
  sec: 2087
  time: '34:47'
  who: Will
- line: Apparently, I had a good sense for what made a winning project.
  sec: 2087
  time: '34:47'
  who: Will
- line: I interviewed with MLH, and they were impressed, but my final interview was
    scheduled just as the pandemic started.
  sec: 2087
  time: '34:47'
  who: Will
- line: MLH had to figure out how to move from in-person to online events, since their
    whole business model was built around physical events.
  sec: 2112
  time: '35:12'
  who: Will
- line: After they sorted that out, I finally got my final interview and was offered
    the job.
  sec: 2112
  time: '35:12'
  who: Will
- line: Unfortunately, there wasn't anything for me to do at first because they hadn't
    figured out how to train new people online.
  sec: 2112
  time: '35:12'
  who: Will
- line: So, I was just waiting for something to come up.
  sec: 2112
  time: '35:12'
  who: Will
- line: Then I noticed MLH had launched a new program called the MLH Fellowship.
  sec: 2143
  time: '35:43'
  who: Will
- line: Many students, including me, had lost internships, so the idea was to partner
    with organizations that had open-source projects—like Meta, which has React and
    other big projects.
  sec: 2143
  time: '35:43'
  who: Will
- line: These organizations could sponsor fellows, and MLH would run the program,
    providing mentorship and structure to help students contribute to real open-source
    projects.
  sec: 2143
  time: '35:43'
  who: Will
- line: This way, students could learn how to work on large repositories, not just
    small personal projects.
  sec: 2190
  time: '36:30'
  who: Will
- line: They could put this experience on their CVs and say they contributed to something
    like React, and actually built something useful—not just fixed a typo.
  sec: 2190
  time: '36:30'
  who: Will
- line: MLH needed people to interview and vet students for the program.
  sec: 2208
  time: '36:48'
  who: Will
- line: Since I had nothing to do—my university exams were canceled—I volunteered
    to help.
  sec: 2208
  time: '36:48'
  who: Will
- line: I got very involved, especially with technical interviews, because I had a
    lot of free time and MLH was still figuring out how to run the program.
  sec: 2208
  time: '36:48'
  who: Will

    to figure things out.
  sec: 2237
  time: '37:17'
  who: Will
- line: I thought it sounded great, so what I thought would be a summer internship
    turned into a part-time job for another eight months.
  sec: 2237
  time: '37:17'
  who: Will
- line: We only planned to run one program, but when the idea came up to do it again,
    I said yes.
  sec: 2237
  time: '37:17'
  who: Will
- line: I went full-time in the summer of 2021 and worked there for about three years.
  sec: 2274
  time: '37:54'
  who: Will
- line: MLH started as a hackathon company but branched out into developer education,
    especially for early-stage students who want to become developers.
  sec: 2274
  time: '37:54'
  who: Will
- line: Hackathons are a great way to learn, but the fellowship is the next step—it’s
    like an internship where you learn valuable skills to help you get a job at your
    dream company.
  sec: 2274
  time: '37:54'
  who: Will
- line: So the idea was to help motivated students who wanted to do something with
    their time, but didn’t have guidance.
  sec: 2309
  time: '38:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: They wanted to spend their time learning and building something.
  sec: 2309
  time: '38:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 2322
  time: '38:42'
  who: Will
- line: You had a bunch of open source projects from sponsors, and you mentored the
    students on how to find what to work on and how to open pull requests, right?
  sec: 2330
  time: '38:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. We worked with maintainers, who gave us lists of good first
    issues and valuable tasks.
  sec: 2342
  time: '39:02'
  who: Will
- line: We helped students understand pull requests and made sure they wrote clean
    code. The main goal was to avoid giving maintainers extra work by submitting poor-quality
    pull requests.
  sec: 2342
  time: '39:02'
  who: Will
- line: We taught best practices for Git and how to work collaboratively. Many students
    had never worked in a Git repository with others before. Some were very strong
    developers in certain areas, like data in Python or React, but didn’t know how
    to contribute to a larger project.
  sec: 2380
  time: '39:40'
  who: Will
- line: Many students were overwhelmed by the size of open source projects.
  sec: 2416
  time: '40:16'
  who: Will
- line: We taught them not to try to read the entire codebase—just focus on the part
    they were contributing to. We started them with small issues and gradually ramped
    up to more substantial contributions over the 12 weeks.
  sec: 2416
  time: '40:16'
  who: Will
- line: Another challenge was setting up development environments. Most students had
    only used simple Git repositories and virtual environments. Some open source projects
    have complex setups with multiple stages, so getting used to that was another
    hurdle.
  sec: 2451
  time: '40:51'
  who: Will
- header: 41:16 Mentorship, development environments, and onboarding in open source
- line: How did you learn to help students set up development environments for these
    projects? For some projects, setting up the environment is not trivial.
  sec: 2476
  time: '41:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: I remember trying to prepare the environment for TensorFlow—it felt impossible
    unless you worked at Google. They use tools like Bazel and CMake, everything is
    written in C++, and in the end, I just gave up. I thought, "Do your own thing,"
    even though I was an experienced developer.
  sec: 2476
  time: '41:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did you learn these things yourself? Did you work closely with maintainers
    to understand the setup before helping students?
  sec: 2476
  time: '41:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: The students were organized into small groups called pods, about ten students
    each. In the first cohort, every pod had a team leader, usually a senior engineer
    mentoring as a part-time, evening activity. Later, we transitioned to a student-led
    model, where previous fellows would lead the groups, supported by a group of mentors.
  sec: 2543
  time: '42:23'
  who: Will
- line: We worked with maintainers before the project started to understand setup
    and requirements.
  sec: 2566
  time: '42:46'
  who: Will
- line: They would show us how to get the project running, and we’d turn that into
    resources for the students. Sometimes, maintainers would run workshops for all
    the students, and our team would help them follow along.
  sec: 2566
  time: '42:46'
  who: Will
- line: Some projects were straightforward, but others were difficult. Maintainers
    were usually understanding, especially if their own project was hard to set up.
    Over time, we tried to target projects that were more accessible, because students
    often didn’t have powerful computers.
  sec: 2590
  time: '43:10'
  who: Will
- line: With AI projects, students often lacked enough memory or GPU power, so their
    computers would crash. We provided cloud VMs or encouraged them to use Google
    Colab to get around hardware limitations. Data projects were always the hardest
    because of the computing requirements.
  sec: 2620
  time: '43:40'
  who: Will
- line: As time went on, we avoided projects that were too difficult to set up. For
    example, Meta has many projects, so we could ask them to switch to something more
    accessible.
  sec: 2652
  time: '44:12'
  who: Will
- line: But some companies, like one that used Apache Airflow, insisted on their chosen
    project, and students contributed to specific open issues. Maintainers appreciated
    getting contributions without extra work, but it was always a balance.
  sec: 2652
  time: '44:12'
  who: Will
- line: Not having a powerful enough computer brings back memories for me. I remember
    trying to compile TensorFlow—my computer couldn’t even handle the compilation,
    let alone run the model.
  sec: 2711
  time: '45:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I had to rent a machine on AWS with 32 or 64 GB of RAM just to compile it.
    Is the MLH Fellowship program still running?
  sec: 2711
  time: '45:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it still runs, though I haven’t been involved since 2023. It runs three
    times a year.
  sec: 2762
  time: '46:02'
  who: Will
- line: Before I left, I helped make the program more repeatable and structured. It
    hasn’t expanded much, mainly because companies have cut budgets for open source
    initiatives due to economic changes.
  sec: 2762
  time: '46:02'
  who: Will
- line: There might be more AI-focused programs soon, which would be exciting. It's
    great to see students posting on LinkedIn about finishing the 12-week program
    and contributing to projects like Airflow. We also worked with the Pallets project—Flask
    and Jinja—and some students even became maintainers. It was rewarding to see people
    go from contributors to maintainers and realize how powerful open source can be.
    That outcome was beyond what we imagined when we started.
  sec: 2797
  time: '46:37'
  who: Will
- line: Do you have to be a student to take part? I know Google Summer of Code used
    to require students, and I missed my chance after graduation. Is it the same for
    the MLH Fellowship?
  sec: 2849
  time: '47:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Previously, we required participants to be students, since most of MLH’s community
    comes from student hackathons.
  sec: 2890
  time: '48:10'
  who: Will
- line: However, we eventually opened the fellowship to anyone. Some people joined
    while working other jobs and wanted to change careers—they learned Python part-time
    and passed our technical screen.
  sec: 2890
  time: '48:10'
  who: Will
- line: We can’t teach you to code from scratch, but if you have a basic understanding,
    we teach you how to contribute to open source. Some career changers did the program
    part-time and were often the most motivated and successful students we saw.

    developer advocacy. Let’s spend the last ten minutes on that. What do you do as
    a developer advocate? What are your main responsibilities?
  sec: 2954
  time: '49:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: We recently hired a technical writer, which has made my life easier. My role
    involves teaching users about Kestra. Workflow orchestration is complex, especially
    with a tool like Kestra, which can be used in many different ways for various
    use cases. If people don’t understand it, they won’t use it.
  sec: 2981
  time: '49:41'
  who: Will
- line: I started by improving documentation and creating videos to teach people how
    to use Kestra and understand its purpose. That approach has worked well. Now,
    with our technical writer AJ—big shout out to AJ—I can focus more on videos and
    educational content.
  sec: 3014
  time: '50:14'
  who: Will

    implement typical workflow orchestration use cases.
  sec: 3037
  time: '50:37'
  who: Will
- line: I also create content about tools that work with Kestra, like Postgres, and
    demonstrate interesting use cases. My role has become more focused on outreach
    and education.
  sec: 3037
  time: '50:37'
  who: Will
- line: I think what you do is really cool. Some people who create content, especially
    videos, prefer to write a script first and then create a video from that script.
    For others, like me, it's easier to just record the video directly, since writing
    is more difficult.
  sec: 3075
  time: '51:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Which approach do you use?
  sec: 3075
  time: '51:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I definitely lean more toward your approach. I make rough bullet points about
    what I want to achieve, get a working demo, and then press record, roughly following
    my bullet points.
  sec: 3109
  time: '51:49'
  who: Will
- line: Sometimes I've written blog posts or turned other people's blog posts into
    videos, but I find that following a strict script feels unnatural for me.
  sec: 3109
  time: '51:49'
  who: Will
- line: Now that you have a technical writer on your team, you can make a video from
    bullet points, and the tech writer can help turn that into written content, right?
  sec: 3145
  time: '52:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. We just had a release last week, and we worked together to figure
    out how some of the new features worked. He wrote the documentation page, and
    I made a video to showcase it.

- line: Sometimes he creates the documentation first, and I use that as a basis for
    a video, or I create bullet points for him to expand into documentation. It's
    good that the video doesn't exactly follow the documentation, because otherwise
    it would be boring. The video should offer something extra that the documentation
    doesn't. They both have their own purpose.

  who: Will
- line: Do you have a good recipe for making a good video?
  sec: 3213
  time: '53:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: The key thing is to have a clear goal—what are you trying to achieve with
    the video? Is it to showcase a feature of Kestra or to teach about a new tool?
    If you don't have a clear goal, it's easy to make the video too long or go off
    on tangents. If I don't understand the goal from the beginning, how will the user?
  sec: 3220
  time: '53:40'
  who: Will
- line: So you open a document and write down the key goal for the video. For example,
    you posted about a new release of Kestra with some features. Let's say you need
    to make a video about one of these features. Can you give an example?
  sec: 3249
  time: '54:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: One of the features was a new workflow component called "after execution."
    My main goal was to explain why we added this feature and why it's useful. On
    its own, it just runs once an execution is finished, but the value is that you
    can use it to send notifications with the actual status of the workflow.
  sec: 3270
  time: '54:30'
  who: Will
- line: If the workflow failed, it will say "failed," whereas if it runs during the
    workflow, it will say it's still running. So I put myself in the user's shoes
    and think, "Why is this useful to them?" I build my examples around that goal.
  sec: 3270
  time: '54:30'
  who: Will
- line: So you prepare a document, or maybe just keep it in your head, with the goal
    to showcase the new feature. Then you think of a good example, like sending a
    Slack or Telegram notification, and show exactly how to implement it. Is that
    right?
  sec: 3332
  time: '55:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. When making guide videos, I don't like to cut corners. I show everything
    from step one to the end result. I find it frustrating when technical videos skip
    steps, like setting up Google Cloud, and just assume you know how.
  sec: 3356
  time: '55:56'
  who: Will
- line: I want to show the whole process, from opening Google Cloud to connecting
    it to Python, so viewers aren't left confused. At the same time, I keep a good
    pace, because on YouTube, pacing is everything.
  sec: 3356
  time: '55:56'
  who: Will
- line: If a video is too slow, people tune out and the video doesn't do well. For
    example, our installation guide for Kestra on Google Cloud is 15 minutes long,
    which is reasonable. If an installation video is an hour long, people won't even
    try the tool.

- line: Maybe a last question before we wrap up—what are you working on right now?
  sec: 3436
  time: '57:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: We've started a new "Learn with Kestra" series focused on demoing tools that
    Kestra works with. Instead of making videos just about Kestra, we make videos
    about other tools and then show how Kestra can be useful with them.
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Will
- line: For example, we did one on Docker—explaining what Docker is, why you might
    use it, and how to run containers with Kestra. We did the same with Git. These
    aren't always the best examples of workflow orchestration, but I'm planning one
    on Postgres soon, which is a great use case.
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Will
- line: People want to automate querying and loading data into a database, so I'm
    looking forward to making those examples.
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Will
- line: The start of the video won't talk about Kestra—it will teach why Postgres
    exists and why it's popular. I'm hoping to expand to other tools, like cloud platforms
    such as Google Cloud and AWS. So far, these videos have done well on the channel.
    I'm also working on a video about UV, a new Python package manager. I like to
    try new things to see if they're just hype or actually useful. It's fun for me
    and for the viewers.
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Will
- line: I just went to YouTube, typed "Kestra" in the search box, and found the channel.

    the listeners?
  sec: 3578
  time: '59:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I was at the fellowship, managing a group of student leaders, I felt
    overwhelmed and unsure if I was giving enough support, especially early in my
    career.
  sec: 3599
  time: '59:59'
  who: Will
- line: Someone recommended the book "Turn the Ship Around." It's about leadership
    styles on a Navy ship and how to empower people to lead themselves, rather than
    just follow commands. After reading it, my team felt more empowered, open, and
    honest. If you're working with volunteers or community members, it's a great read
    for anyone who wants to be a better leader.

  who: Will
- line: Thank you, and I hope you forgive me for keeping you four minutes longer.
    Thanks a lot, Will—it was amazing talking to you.Thanks for sharing your stories
    and insights and for the recommendations. I'm sure many listeners will find them
    useful.
