title: 'The Journey of a Data Generalist: From Bioinformatics to Freelancing'
transcript:
- line: This week we'll talk about being a data generalist. We'll discuss going from
    bioinformatics to freelancing. We have a special guest today, Katya. As a freelancer
    Katya is helping companies bridge the gap between business and data by building
    actionable analytics and coaching the teams. She has a lot of broad experience
    in startups, entrepreneurship and scale-ups. Katya was head of analytics at Gitti,
    a beauty brand. She tried to start her own fintech business with Entrepreneur
    First and she worked as a data scientist at Zalando. Welcome to the show. It's
    a pleasure to have you here.
  sec: 71
  time: '1:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, thank you so much for the invitation. It was really nice to catch up,
    actually. I think we've known each other for some time. I'm really happy to be
    here.
  sec: 112
  time: '1:52'
  who: Jekaterina
- header: Jekaterina’s background
- line: I tried to invite you multiple times. Finally, we managed to do this. [chuckles]
    Before we start with our main topic of being a data generalist, let's start with
    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 122
  time: '2:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Let me start a bit from the very beginning and jump to what is happening
    right now. I started, as Alex mentioned, as a bioinformatician – a Bachelor’s
    and Master's degrees in bioinformatics. I worked in different research institutes
    across Europe, Manchester University, Charité here in Berlin, and also at the
    Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona. After getting my Master's degree,
    I realized that I was not motivated that much by research.
  sec: 135
  time: '2:15'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: That's where I switched directly to a startup and was a first data hire there.
    I was hired as a data analyst, and I ended up doing a lot of the data engineering
    part, which I loved, but I didn't enjoy it  that much, maybe. Then I switched
    to Zalando. I also was there at Zalando Payments, where I was building real-time
    machine learning systems for fraud prediction and payment scoring. Basically,
    when you shop on Zalando and you get an invoice and the payment method, that's
    exactly my team who built the algorithm behind that, to enable you to buy with
    this payment method. It was a super-heavy engineering team, lots of PhD people
    and lots of young people – so really ambitious, really nice. That's where all
    my engineering background comes from.
  sec: 135
  time: '2:15'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: Then, after two years there, I was a bit stuck regarding learning. That's
    when a very good friend of mine said, “Hey, why don't you start something?” and
    that's when I went to Entrepreneur First. You can imagine that there's a startup
    accelerator, founded in London, they have programs across the globe. Basically,
    it's pre-team, pre-idea. You go there as an individual, you need to identify yourself
    as a CEO or a CTO, and then it's kind of like speed dating – speed co-founding.
    [chuckles] I'm more on the CTO side (a technical person) so I was trying to find
    a CEO match.
  sec: 135
  time: '2:15'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: Basically, you work with one person, you match, and you work together for
    three days. Normally, after three days, you realize that either it’s going well
    or it’s not, because at the end of the day, startups fail because of the mismatch
    on founders. Within that program, I tried to found a fintech company, but I went
    really in a very different, weird segment – I went into compliance. It's like
    the most unsexy and the most regulated thing ever. So I realized [cross-talk]
  sec: 135
  time: '2:15'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: What is compliance?
  sec: 300
  time: '5:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Basically, it's KYC – Know Your Customer – know your business. You need to
    do legal checks on the person –who you are as a person. Have you ever had bankruptcy?
    Are you associated with money laundering? Do you have a company that maybe was
    associated with money laundering? All those kinds of checks that, for instance,
    you also need to do when you open a bank account – then you do this postident
    thing. We went into the B2B “know your business” compliance part. After that,
    I realized that it was interesting, but… and we wanted to try to copycat an American
    startup, but it didn't work here in Europe. Then Corona happened and I was really
    exhausted after almost six months of Entrepreneur First.
  sec: 302
  time: '5:02'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: Really, seriously, I was not ready to found a company. It was like everybody
    around me were founding companies and I was like, “Okay, let me jump on that wave.”
    But internally and mentally and emotionally, I was not prepared. I would wake
    up two weeks in a row with that headache. That was already a sign that something
    was not going well. Then I joined Delivery Hero’s fintech department. And again,
    I was the first data scientist there. I also tried to build basically what we
    did at Zalando – the whole machine learning for fraud production. I love the people,
    but I didn't feel that it was for me, so I left.
  sec: 302
  time: '5:02'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: That's when I joined Gitti, a direct-to-consumer brand, selling nail polishers.
    Within my junior period there, we went into the cosmetics segment. Also, they
    launched (I think several months ago) skincare. So it's a beauty brand. There,
    I basically built the whole BI and team from scratch, and helped on the fundraising.
    Then on the first of September, I left Gitti to start freelancing.
  sec: 302
  time: '5:02'
  who: Jekaterina
- header: How Jekaterina started freelancing
- line: That's quite a journey. What do you do as a freelancer? Maybe before you start
    telling us what you do now, it's also interesting to know – how did you decide
    what you want to do as a freelancer?
  sec: 433
  time: '7:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. I never tried to... I think I just asked myself the question, “What
    is the next step for me?” And then what happened? I had a Bumble date. I went
    on this Bumble date, and we didn’t match personally, but then the guy was like,
    “Hey, I will invite you to a founders dinner.” I went to the founders’ dinner.
    There were only founders there – I think 10 people. One guy arrived super late
    and we didn’t not chat with him. But what I did after was just add all the people
    who were there on LinkedIn. And this one guy that arrived super late wrote to
    me “Hey, Katya. We want to hire you.” And I'm like, “No, I don't want to be hired.
    I want to do freelancing. What about it?”
  sec: 449
  time: '7:29'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: Then in three days, he sends me a freelancing contract, and I’m still at Gitti
    five days a week, and he sends me a freelance contract for one day a week. So
    I'm like, “What do I do now?” So I go to Gitti. I don't know how, but I managed
    to convince them to give me a four days a week contract. I started freelancing
    for the company. Now, it's also interesting because today, this company (Kittl)
    announced a Series A fundraiser of 11 million. That’s what I was hired for back
    then – to help them with the fundraising, building the data deck. So that's how
    it started. They are a SaaS company. It's a completely different business model
    than what I'm used to at Gitti, because Gitti is typical ecommerce.
  sec: 449
  time: '7:29'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: After a month of freelancing I was like, “That looks really good. I really
    enjoy that.” Then some friends reached out and I was like, “Okay, let me help
    you.” And then I decided just to leave Gitti and see what kind of clients I could
    attract. I didn't even know what kind of clients I should attract. I was like,
    “Okay, let's just leave and figure this out.”
  sec: 449
  time: '7:29'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: That's quite optimistic. So you left. How did you actually figure out what
    kind of services companies need? Was it just ad hoc meetings in Bumble? [chuckles]
  sec: 580
  time: '9:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] No, then I switched to Tinder. [chuckles] I mean, it was still calculated
    risk because I had this one client at the end of the day – one long term client
    and one more kind of short-term client. So it was not like I decided, “Today I
    leave.” and then I left. No, it was more of a calculated risk in that I still
    have income (at least something) that would allow me to start.'
  sec: 593
  time: '9:53'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: I left and then in September/October I was sitting on my couch. I was like,
    “I don't have clients. I don't have income.” I was tapping into my savings and
    I started panicking. Of course, I didn't announce to anybody that I was freelancing.
    So how should anybody know about that?
  sec: 593
  time: '9:53'
  who: Jekaterina
- header: Jekaterina’s initial ways of getting freelancing clients
- line: So you quit but nobody knew that you were a freelancer?
  sec: 644
  time: '10:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly! I didn't announce it on LinkedIn. I didn't tell anybody. I mean,
    some people knew. I had connections. But it was not enough to pay the bills at
    the end of the day. That was a hard realization, because I was like, “Whoa, if
    I can't make money, now I need to go back to work for someone.” That really hit
    me. So what I decided to do was announce that I'm freelancing right now, but not
    like, “Hey, I'm a data freelancer. I'm here. Pay me!” But rather to do a series
    of LinkedIn posts – I think there were eight LinkedIn posts directed at... [cross-talk]
  sec: 647
  time: '10:47'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: I saw one of them and I thought, “Okay. Actually, I wanted to invite you for
    a long time. So let me do this.” [chuckles] Sorry for interrupting. That helps
    to get noticed, right?
  sec: 690
  time: '11:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, especially with selfies. If you post a selfie, it's crazy how many
    people immediately recognize you. If they associate your face with a topic, it's
    even much easier at the end of the day. So I created those eight posts addressing
    direct-to-consumer brands on how to structure their KPIs, what to look at, when
    to look at this, how to come up with easy KPIs and not with super-complicated
    ones. And of course, with a selfie. [chuckles] I was posting for two weeks, I
    think, and I got two clients out of that.
  sec: 701
  time: '11:41'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: How did you feel about posting selfies?
  sec: 746
  time: '12:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was so hard. It was so weird. Also doing selfies… I mean, I do have Instagram,
    but I have a closed Instagram. It's a different thing. But on LinkedIn it’s a
    professional thing. I was like, “It's so uncomfortable.” But that's the thing,
    you need to do what you need to do and then you just do it. The funny part is,
    the first and second post, I was like, “Oh my god, this is so awful.” But then
    I didn't care anymore because I just got so many likes and so many shares as well.
    People were also writing to me, “Hey, you're doing a great job.” I was like, “Pff.
    Okay, then let's do more selfies.” [laughs]
  sec: 749
  time: '12:29'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: I still don't know if I'll ever post a selfie on LinkedIn. [chuckles] Because
    it’s so awkward, at least to me.
  sec: 792
  time: '13:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: I know, it’s really awkward. But I was like, “Eh, whatever. Let's just see
    how it works out.” And then exactly – I got two clients there.
  sec: 800
  time: '13:20'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: And you got clients in the segment that you wanted, right? These are direct-to-consumer
    brands who need help structuring their KPIs?
  sec: 812
  time: '13:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's funny enough. One is not. One is kind of a marketplace. It's kind of
    similar to a direct-to-consumer brand, but a marketplace. And another one was
    a very German company Mittelstand somewhere not far from Munich. What they wanted
    – and that's so crazy because my profile is so broad, I can do so much stuff that
    it's also hard for me to understand what pain point I'm solving exactly. So that
    company wanted – they had lots of data, different kinds of data and they wanted
    to make a project with me on how to monetize this data. I would go and figure
    out if we can sell this data to the government or to the job centers or to whatever.
    So it's not working with the data, but rather trying to find revenue streams for
    the data that they have.
  sec: 821
  time: '13:41'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: It's completely different. It's not direct-to-consumer. It's completely different
    things. And that's so funny. I have three kinds of different clients. One client
    wants to have this full experience of having a head of analytics, who would negotiate
    with the vendors, who will sign the contract… well, not sign the contracts, but
    make sure that the contracts are written properly and owning everything end to
    end. It's like an internal data team basically.
  sec: 821
  time: '13:41'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: Another client really wants help only with the fundraising. Third client wants
    me to coach their data team and the business team, because sometimes it happens
    that they don't chat with each other. Another (fourth) type of client hired me
    to automate some stuff that is just hard for them to do in Google Sheets. I just
    have those small technical projects. It’s four different kinds of ways, or packages,
    that I can offer – and that's why it's hard to communicate what exactly I’m offering.
  sec: 821
  time: '13:41'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: But you still managed to get clients, then I guess it works.
  sec: 953
  time: '15:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. It's more for all those LinkedIn posts – when you do something
    like that, you really need to understand who you're targeting and then adjust
    the messaging for them. Because if it's too broad, people don't feel that they
    are being addressed.
  sec: 957
  time: '15:57'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: You're still targeting the same audience – the same people, right? Direct-to-consumer
    brands?
  sec: 975
  time: '16:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I try to, because that's where most of my knowledge comes from, basically.
    Yeah.
  sec: 981
  time: '16:21'
  who: Jekaterina
- header: How being a generalist helped Jekaterina’s career
- line: But from what you said about your knowledge and your background, you did pretty
    much everything when it comes to data. Maybe you didn’t do MLOps, or at least
    you didn't tell us about that, but every single data role that is out there, you
    did this. You did data analysis, and as a data analyst, you needed to do data
    engineering. Then you did data science at Zalando.
  sec: 990
  time: '16:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Then you worked at Gitti as a head of BI, or somebody that set up the BI team.
    I don’t know, you didn't work maybe as an ML engineer, but apart from that… or
    maybe you actually did do some stuff there, too. So it's like everything. Also,
    in addition to that, you tried a startup. That's a lot. Maybe the question I have
    is – it seems like you enjoy doing different things.
  sec: 990
  time: '16:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: But does it help you in your career to know so many things and to be interested
    in so many areas?
  sec: 990
  time: '16:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. That's this whole generalist part, right? I never wanted to be a specialist
    in anything. I never wanted to optimize, to figure out how many layers I want
    to have in my deep learning model. I'm not excited about that. You immediately
    see on my face, I'm like “Ugh”. But what I really get excited about is connecting
    the dots between all those specialized people in the business. Because I did data
    engineering, I did a bit of MLOps as well by the way, I did a bit of marketing
    analytics, I did BI, I did tracking (I hate tracking [chuckles]) – this whole
    Google Analytics thing, but I also did that. Then I can challenge all of those
    parts and know the best practices there. Can I do it myself? Some of the stuff,
    yes and some of the stuff, no.
  sec: 1055
  time: '17:35'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: Then it also starts to be – I'm not a profile for corporate companies, for
    instance. For Zalando right now, what I enjoy doing and what I collected over
    the time – I'm not the best fit. For Delivery Hero either, I'm not the best fit.
    Because they are searching for very specialized people and I don't want to do
    that. My profile, this whole generalistic approach, works better for startups,
    where I can chat with the business, and I can easily explain the numbers to them
    and then they can go to the marketing team and figure out their marketing analytics
    or go to the tech team and speak their language.
  sec: 1055
  time: '17:35'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: That's so funny, because bioinformatics, it's a bridge between informaticians
    and biologists because those two don't know how to communicate with each other.
    Throughout my entire career, I was always just this person who links someone but
    doesn't know anything in depth. [chuckles]
  sec: 1055
  time: '17:35'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: Do you think it somehow makes your chances of having a successful career smaller?
    Or do you think it's fine?
  sec: 1176
  time: '19:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you're a generalist sitting in Zalando, and you need to optimize for deep
    learning models, you will be internally unhappy by default. And if you're internally
    unhappy in your job, you will not succeed in this job. In order to succeed, you
    need to be happy. [laughs] [Alexey agrees] I think it boils down to this – the
    more excited you are, the more you overdeliver. Maybe let me brag. It was so crazy
    right now.
  sec: 1189
  time: '19:49'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: For one of my clients, they were using Fivetran. Fivetran is a data extraction
    tool. Basically, it gets the data, let's say, from Shopify and packs the raw data
    into the data warehouse. What I figured out is that they had a bug in their codebase
    for how they calculate spends on Google ads. What I did is just push the fix to
    their codebase and it got merged. This thing just made me so happy. The client
    was like, “What?! You just improved our vendor codebase!” I'm like, “Yes.” I'm
    just super happy about this. Once you're happy, you're going this extra mile,
    and you're enjoying it. You are enjoying working until super late.
  sec: 1189
  time: '19:49'
  who: Jekaterina
- header: Connecting business and data
- line: But it still looks like you somewhat have focus right now. Right now, at least
    your posts focus on KPIs. I guess, this is related to what you said you enjoyed
    doing most, which is connecting the dots between different people and engineers.
    That's correct, right? Right now, this is your focus?
  sec: 1282
  time: '21:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, right now I'm focusing on connecting the dots between business and data.
    Basically, helping business people understand how to steer their business and
    according to what numbers – easy numbers or even more complicated numbers, and
    how to transfer those KPIs or this logic for KPIs into the infrastructure. What
    do I need there? Do I need help from the tech team? I cannot do it myself. How
    can I do it? And do I do this whole implementation or outsource this implementation?
    But I know exactly what the steps there are.
  sec: 1309
  time: '21:49'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: So the focus right now is on working together with the founders or business
    people and to translate this everything into the data parts. Again, for instance,
    data science, for me, is out of the question right now, because I'm working with
    the founders, who just really need to know, “What was our revenue yesterday? What
    did we pay for the customers yesterday? What was the percentage of returning customers?”
    That’s easier stuff, but that's what they need to know in order to understand
    how to steer the business and how the business is going. Even at Gitti, we never
    started with data science, although I wanted to, but just the business was not
    there.
  sec: 1309
  time: '21:49'
  who: Jekaterina
- header: How Jekaterina’s LinkedIn posts helped her get clients
- line: I see that we have a few questions and some of them are related to the discussion.
    A question from Adonis is related to your posts. The question is, “Looking back,
    what was the most important thing about the posts that helped you get the clients?”
  sec: 1389
  time: '23:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'What was the most important thing in the LinkedIn posts? Really, it was three
    things: figuring out who I am addressing so that I would structure the posts in
    a way that the people who read it will understand immediately that I''m addressing
    them. You don''t start with “What will my post be?” You start with “What is my
    audience? What''s the type of voice I''m using?” Am I professional, flirty, and
    humorous or am I super professional? What is the style? This is one thing.'
  sec: 1406
  time: '23:26'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: Then the second thing is, I shared those posts with two of my friends, and
    they had brutal feedback on that. I took it, I improved it – done. So getting
    feedback was the second thing. And the third one, I think it was one of the hardest
    – to put myself out there with those selfies. That's where internally I had to
    struggle with myself. That's where you also realize that might be the point when
    you're getting out of your comfort zone, which also might be good. [chuckles]
  sec: 1406
  time: '23:26'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: We already discussed who you are addressing – direct-to-consumer brands who
    are interested in improving or defining their KPIs. What about the type of voice
    and style? Is it flirty, as you said, or is it professional? How do you decide?
    Do you test this? Or do you just assume that this one will work better? Maybe
    walk us through one of the posts and how you did it.
  sec: 1488
  time: '24:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: What I realized is that I love chatting with people. I'm loud. I love laughing.
    I love stupid jokes. I love clever jokes. But I can also be serious, professional
    and clever and figure out stuff and help people. That's what I thought – I wanted
    to bring my personality over through those posts. Basically, professional, clever,
    but filled with a bit of my weird humor. [chuckles]
  sec: 1515
  time: '25:15'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: I also wanted to kind of reflect this whole journey a bit. I realized that
    I don't want to fake anything. At the end of the day, clients are not only paying
    for the infrastructure, they are paying for the whole package. The whole package
    is this energetic person who comes into the room and is always saying hi to everyone
    and even entertains the team sometimes. This energy is what people pay for as
    well, at the end of the day.
  sec: 1515
  time: '25:15'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: Do you have any go-to stupid jokes that you use to energize the team? [chuckles]
  sec: 1584
  time: '26:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, no. It's super ad hoc-ey, right? It's not even stupid joking. It's rather
    those internal jokes that you get with the teams, while you sit with them. You
    just start to be friends with those people, right? It's so funny, with all my
    clients, with the older teams, I'm in a really good relationship, and they are
    super happy to see me and I'm also super happy to see them. So you start to have
    those internal jokes at the end of the day.
  sec: 1589
  time: '26:29'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: I'm trying to make a connection between the posts that target a specific audience
    and the four different types of work that you do. To me, they don't seem super
    related. The posts are KPI-related but, as you said, your work falls into four
    different buckets – full experience as a head of analytics, fundraising, coaching
    data and business teams, and then automating stuff. These are the kinds of different
    packages. So how did the posts help you get things that don't seem very related?

- line: Yeah, it’s because of the reach. They figured out, “Hey, this person knows
    something. What she writes makes sense. Let’s just chat with her.” People kind
    of relate it. Of course, fundraising is another thing. But people relate that,
    “Okay, she's technical enough that she can automate some stuff and she understands
    me immediately.” That's what I meant. It's hard for me and that's what I need
    to figure out – how to transmit the message of what I really do.

    I had calls at 11 PM and had to work till 3 AM because in the morning we had to
    submit everything to the investor. It's not this dream job. It's super intense.
    The day after, I was just lying in my bed sleeping. So do I want to do this job
    for the next three years? Or what is it exactly that I'm enjoying the most where
    I don't burn myself out either? First, I need to actually figure out this part
    and then I need to figure out how to transmit it through a LinkedIn post so that
    I attract the right audience as well.

    is fun and that's where you get lots of understanding about things like what investors
    want, how they steer the business, or want to steer the business, but it's super
    intense. Let's put it differently. At the end of the day, what matters are also
    people – who you work with.

    some parts that I don't enjoy doing like data warehouse optimization. I'm like,
    “Whaaaat?” But that still helps – the people help, this whole atmosphere helps.
    That's where I’m still not sure which direction to go in, regarding what I love.
    Plus, is there a market for that as well? Fundraising doesn't happen every day.
  sec: 1761
  time: '29:21'
  who: Jekaterina

    still related to KPIs? You need to show the company in a good light, “Okay, these
    are the KPIs and this is how the KPIs look so far and this is how they will look
    in the future.” So you're still kind of connecting business and data for fundraising.
    Right?
  sec: 1826
  time: '30:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, exactly. Basically, there are just questions of cohorts, “How active
    are our cohorts?” And I sit together with the founder and we define what a cohort
    actually is, what retention actually is, and how we calculate this. Then, there
    are 10 different ways of how we can calculate it and you decide, “Okay, which
    one so I submit and how do I visualize it?” And if there is some kind of weird
    stuff happening, “How do I explain this so that investors don't find it weird.”
    Basically, we sit together with the business and try to figure out how to show,
    what to show, and then I just go collect the data through different databases,
    different systems, wrangle something in Python, create the charts in Google Sheets.
    I started loving Google Sheets. [chuckles] And then it’s iterate, iterate, iterate.
    And then maybe investors sometimes have other questions.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. For instance, for SaaS, the business to consumer segment (not B2B, but
    B2C). There, you sign up. Let’s take Facebook for example – you sign up and then
    you can post, you can like, you can just be active on the platform. Now the question
    is – those who signed up in April, how active are they? That's where you define
    activity. What is activity? Is it liking? Is it scrolling? Is it whatever? Those
    who signed up in April, how active are they compared to those who signed up in
    September, for instance? And if you see that September cohort is really bad, you're
    like, “Okay, what happened? Did our product start to be really bad? Yes, no? Is
    it the traffic that marketing's attracting? Is it bad or good? Yes, no?” Then
    you start to dig deeper like, “What is it about those people that they are just
    not active on the platform from specific cohorts?”
  sec: 1915
  time: '31:55'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: Okay, first it's about defining KPIs, then defining cohorts, doing some analysis,
    showing charts, and then if something is off, going there and understanding what's
    happening. You do this for fundraising, too? Does it help to attract more money?
  sec: 1991

  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. That's so funny, half of the stuff that is normally done for fundraising
    can also be reused in the business – to look at this on a monthly level. Some
    of the stuff we never implemented – it's only for fundraising. But yeah, it's
    kind of how business wants to steer and then we just figure out how to see how
    the business performs. What are the users doing? Why are they doing it?

  sec: 2043
  time: '34:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: This project will be… I'm not doing it right now, it's one of the future projects.
    The problem there is that the company is pretty... It's like six, seven years
    old. They do have the data team, they do have the business team. However, it's
    hard for businesses to be data-driven because nobody coached them to be data-driven.
    What is data driven nowadays? Everybody uses this word, but nobody can explain
    what it actually means at the end of the day or how to actually start being this.
    So the business team is super frustrated. They need to be data-driven, but they
    have no clue how and what this means. Then the data team is there, and they need
    to manage all these ad hoc requests. The infrastructure might already be outdated.
    And then they don't understand just what the business team needs because they
    don't have time to understand the business.
  sec: 2056

- line: Those people are not business savvy. That's the thing, you have engineers
    or data people who are not business savvy and you have business people who are
    not data savvy, so it will not work by default. And that's where I try to help.
    Well, I try to help the business people to be more data-driven, or data savvy,
    and the data people to be more business savvy. Then once all those two parties
    go towards each other a bit, like one step, then it's already a success at the
    end of the day. It's also hard for me to measure the success because what I do
    is just coach them on how to communicate with each other. [chuckles] How do you
    measure communication – the success of my work? It takes time, right? It takes
    even several months, actually, when business will know the impact of this coaching.

    But then, I guess, the ultimate goal is to let people be able to talk between
    each other without you, right? [Jekaterina agrees] You do this, then you leave,
    and you help somebody else achieve the same.

- line: I think you mentioned that. The question I have right now is “How does being
    a generalist help you now?” And I think one thing you mentioned is – you've done
    a lot of stuff already, so sometimes you can just go ahead and do this. Even if
    you don't do this yourself, you kind of have an idea in your mind of how you would
    approach this. So that's one thing, I think, that can help you in your current
    role. Are there other things that you think are also helpful for you right now?
  sec: 2203
  time: '36:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I also mentioned that I know best practices. That's so funny, people
    know that I know best practices. but I don't know… I know what doesn't work for
    sure. Those mistakes are normally done by young teams over and over. You see the
    patterns, and you're like, “Hey, I already know now that in three months we'll
    struggle with that. So let's not do that.” So that’s knowing what doesn't work
    because I was in those different roles, it helps me now to prevent, let's call
    them “disasters,” in the future.
  sec: 2234
  time: '37:14'
  who: Jekaterina

    communicate, and then you try to communicate in their language. That's why, with
    the generalist part – I chatted with so many different people. I had to chat with
    the data engineers, PMS, CEOs, CTOs, CPOs. And you need to find a way of how to
    make them what you want them to make. [chuckles] That entails different approaches
    to different people. You need to know how to motivate every segment of it – every
    person, basically.

- line: Yes, it’s hard to sell myself, because people just ask, “Hey, Katya – what
    is the difference between you and a data agency?” This is also a hard explanation
    for me to actually define the real difference there, because again, people also
    pay for this energy. How do I tell them, “Hey, you will pay for the nice mood
    that you will have in the office?” [chuckles] It doesn't work that way.

  sec: 2390
  time: '39:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are several data agencies in Berlin that help direct-to-consumer brands
    build data warehouses, reporting tools on top of it, and dashboards. They may
    also might help a bit with the tracking. I'm kind of competing with them, but
    on the other hand, I'm not. Because I'm not going against the typical data engineer
    – I'm more this holistic who will really fit with the business-first, figure things
    out and then implement.
  sec: 2393
  time: '39:53'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: From what you described in terms of what data agencies do, it looks like they
    already have some packages. If I know that I need a data warehouse, I go to them,
    and I tell them, “Hey, come over and build me a data warehouse.” But what if I
    don't know that I need a data warehouse? Who do I go to?
  sec: 2429
  time: '40:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that's the thing. Everything is about how you sell yourself. Data agencies
    don't sell themselves by saying, “We’ll build your data warehouse.” They sell
    dashboards. And that's what the CEO and CPO and the business founders need, right?
    What is in the back? They're like, “I don't care. I just want this fancy dashboard
    that shows me my sales for the last several days.” Of course, the agencies figured
    out that this is a selling point – their selling audience is actually C-level
    (CMO, CEO, CPOs). If there’s a CTO, that already means that they might be a tech
    team who can kind of handle that. Those people are the selling points. So how
    do I adjust my messaging to those people? That's the thing, again, adjusting the
    messaging so that the customers feel addressed at the end of the day.

  sec: 2504
  time: '41:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. [laughs] Exactly. What I feel is that I'm more on the business side. I
    try to be more on the business side and because I was operationally involved at
    Gitti at steering business with data, and also in the fundraising events, which
    is experience that those agencies don't have – operationally being involved in
    businesses, helping the marketing team. They just come, build, they leave (normally).
    Of course, sometimes they maintain the infrastructure and maintain the dashboards,
    but they are not actively involved in the business team. And that's where I get
    involved immediately.

    pros and cons of freelancing, according to your experience?”
  sec: 2560
  time: '42:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we discussed this with Alex before – don't be confused by this “free”
    prefix in “freelancing”. You're free in terms of choosing who you work with and
    when you work, but that doesn't mean that you will now surf for a week and then
    can maybe do three hours of work. This doesn't work, because you need to work
    on the project that you have right now, but you also need to grow your own freelancing
    business. This basically entails reaching out to new customers, or helping them
    somehow, so that you get the audience of people who know you. You need to make
    this audience bigger. Those are two things that you need to do in parallel.
  sec: 2571
  time: '42:51'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: That's why there's not so much “free” time in freelancing at the end of the
    day. The process that I use, for instance, I like to work with ambitious people
    – startups. Those are very motivated people, fast people, fast thinkers – they
    want to solve the problem. I'm really intrigued by those kinds of people. The
    disadvantage of freelancing is that sometimes – one month you will be without
    money. How do you deal with this? That means that if I earn like 10K today, that
    doesn't mean that I need to spend those 10K today. That means that I need to distribute
    those 10K and do this whole financial planning of my life, so that I can buy food.
    This is exactly what hit me in September/October. I was just without clients,
    so without the proper income. And this is a bit scary.
  sec: 2571

  sec: 2685
  time: '44:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, yes, planning. Also, knowing exactly how much you spend and not overspend.
    You must see that you’re not only working on your project, but you’re also growing
    this audience that will become the leads afterward. Basically, projects are short-term
    optimization, but this growth of the audience is long-term optimization, where
    you don't know what will come out of this at the end. That’s the instability or
    the risk that you just take. Of course, you should not go freelancing if you don't
    have any savings. That's hard. Mentally, this will be very hard.
  sec: 2689

  sec: 2738
  time: '45:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Exactly. Then it's fine. The hardest part… if you don't have clients,
    you will figure it out. Maybe you can go to the coffee shop and work there. You
    will figure it out. But mental health and this mental instability – that hits
    hard.
  sec: 2743

  who: Jekaterina

  sec: 2765
  time: '46:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: In September/October, when I was sitting without clients, I was like, “Whoa.”
    I was immediately thinking, “Okay, can I sell something on those platforms where
    freelancers do some kind of small stuff for you? Do I need to sign up for the
    freelancers networks? What should I do?”
  sec: 2769

  who: Jekaterina

  sec: 2787
  time: '46:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. Then I was like “This is not what I want to do at the end of
    the day.” And then I came up with those posts. So you need to be creative, and
    you will be creative once you realize… [chuckles]
  sec: 2788
  time: '46:28'
  who: Jekaterina
- line: That if you don't, then you won’t have anything to eat, right?
  sec: 2805
  time: '46:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. But that's the funny part. There should be calculated risks. I didn't
    go freelancing all of a sudden. I had a customer already, where I was like, “Okay,
    we discussed things. It’s been going well for several months. I feel good. They
    feel good about me.” So that's when I felt like, “Okay, I can leave my stable
    job.” And then, I learned about this myself, that I can stretch myself – I started
    to learn about my boundaries, about my limitations, and also about myself more,
    once I got out of my comfort zone. That's the thing. Oh! One more thing that's
    crazy with freelancing – every new client will challenge you. I feel like I’m
    constantly in the job application process and in a constant salary negotiation
    process. You come in and what I'm used to at Gitti, but had been working there
    for two years – I had lots of freedom, but only because I earned this freedom.
    With every new client, I don't have this freedom. I don't have this trust. So
    I need to build this trust, and building this trust with every client is hard.
    It takes time. That's where I was like “Woah, constant salary negotiations, constant
    job application, constant building trust… this is hard.”
  sec: 2808

    yes, you will enjoy that. And it doesn't matter how long you will work at the
    end of the day. But it's also the question of “Is it working hours or not?” That's

    scattered and maybe also more irritated by some stuff. That's what I love about
    Gitti, as I also said to the founder – I was able to see within Gitti, that I
    managed to do lots of things and that I was able to get out of my comfort zone
    and achieve lots of stuff. I always felt like, “There is a problem. Yes, it's
    a problem but I will figure out how to do this.” This belief that you will figure
    it out somehow turned back to me as, “I don't need to be sad. I don't need to
    be depressed about this. I will figure this out.” This was a mind change for me.
    That's where I am now. I'm super happy with what I'm doing again. This happiness

    base, you need to grow your network, you need to have leads for the next gigs.
    After you finish the current job, you need to have another one. The question from

    – when somebody doesn't answer my message. [chuckles] So I decided not to go with
    that. Before I started posting on LinkedIn, what I did – I was invited to a Slack
    channel of direct-to-consumer brands, where founders and operators talk about
    where to get the best price for packaging, for instance. There were like 200 people,
    and I stalked all of them on LinkedIn. I was blocked by LinkedIn twice for several
    days because of this. Because I was just doing it really quickly. What I needed
    was for them to see that I checked them out. I didn't care about their profiles.
    Then two people reached out to me as well from there. Basically, this stalking
    helped a bit. [chuckles]
  sec: 3113

  who: Jekaterina
- line: It's like cold outreach, but a little bit different, right? You stalk them,
    you make sure that they have this view – in LinkedIn, there is a setting that
    lets people see that you visited their profile. This is enabled for you, so you
    visit their profile, they see it, and then they check your profile, right? And
    then they decide to talk to you themselves?

    I agree. But it's fine. It worked out. And it took me maybe one hour for two possible
    leads. Fine. So there’s that. Also, if somebody posts on LinkedIn, “Hey, I have
    this reporting. What is the best reporting tool?” Then I jump immediately on that
    question. I'm also in several private Slack channels where people ask questions
    and I also jumped on that. I'm like, “Okay, let me help you.”

    was like, “Hey, let's have a chat. I want to understand your problem. I might
    not be able to do that, but I know people who might be able to do that.” We just
    chatted for 20 minutes and she was super thankful that I just reached out and
    helped her. It might not be that she converts to a customer, but she has seen
    my face, she has seen what I can do, so she can also maybe suggest me to someone.

    That's your secret?

- line: Selfies, yeah. That's the most important thing. Do you work remotely or is
    it always within Berlin in an office?
  sec: 3299

  who: Alexey
- line: I love being in the office. That's where this whole energy is great – this
    whole communication with the team. I am not the typical digital nomad who will
    go to Bali, surf, and then work. I'm trying to always do 100%. So either 100%
    work or 100% vacation. I don’t do this whole workcation thing. No. I am still
    considering if I should stay in Germany and Berlin or if I should move somewhere
    else. I still don't know.

- line: But I feel now that there is a freedom for me. That's where the “free” comes
    in. If I'm able to structure my clients in a way that I can work remotely for
    them, and I don't need to be in the office, then I can move to wherever I want.
    This is also amazing. That's where, all sudden, the advantage of this “free” in
    “freelance” comes in.

- line: Interesting. I noticed that there is one question in the list of questions
    that we prepared. I don't know if we have enough time – we only have three minutes
    – but maybe we can try to cover it quickly. What would be your advice for people
    who feel stuck at what they're doing?
  sec: 3371

- line: Don't sit, act. Act immediately. Again, don't quit today. [chuckles] Don't
    do that. Let's say you're a machine learning engineer, and you're like, “I'm a
    bit stuck at work. What should I do?” Reach out to consultancies and talk to them.
    Maybe you could join them as a freelancer one day a week. Just start chatting
    with people and try to figure out what others can offer. Or do what I did as well.
    I reached out to data consultants – people who have a similar background to me,
    but much more experienced. He is targeting other customer groups. I just told
    him “Hey, I want to do this. What would be your advice?” Just start chatting with
    people and try to figure things out. Take calculated risks, but don't sit on the
    call on the couch. Really just start doing something. Even small things are also
    fine.

    do? In general – talk to people, right?

  who: Alexey
- line: But that's the thing, even if you don't want to do freelancing. Just start
    chatting with people who you think are exciting, who you think can help you with
    advice or something else. People love to help. People will write back.

  who: Alexey
- line: 'Yes. I think there are two. One is more general, as in “generalist”. It’s
    called The Power of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact.
    Basically, they talk a lot about lots of things, like how to do storytelling with
    very nice examples from all over the world. They explain how to create moments
    for other people that they will remember and how to create this energy, and what
    it actually means to create this energy. I love this book. I just read it recently.'

  who: Jekaterina
- line: So that's the general book and another one is more about marketing analytics,
    which is what I was doing the last few years. There's this guy in Google, who’s
    like the Senior Director of Strategic Analytics or something – Avinash Kaushik.
    So his blog and newsletters. That's just a bomb of knowledge. So for anyone who
    is interested in marketing analytics, that's the newsletter to read.

    LinkedIn. Right? [Jekaterina confirms] We’ll include the link to your profile.
    I think that's all we have time for today. That was amazing – talking to you.
    You're very energetic. I feel the energy now. I can go and work and something.
    Great! Yeah, thanks for joining us today. Thanks for sharing all that. Thanks
    for telling your story. It was amazing. Thanks, everyone else, for joining us
    today. Have a great rest of your day!
