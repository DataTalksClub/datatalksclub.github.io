transcript:
- line: "This week, we'll talk about public speaking. We have a special guest today,\
    \ Ben Taylor. Ben is the chief AI evangelist at DataRobot. If you use LinkedIn,\
    \ you must have seen Ben in your feed quite often. If you don't, you most likely\
    \ saw him on one of the conferences or webinars, or somewhere on the internet.\
    \ Ben does a lot of talks \u2013 at least one per week, if I'm correct. Maybe\
    \ even more often."

  who: Ben
- line: "It was very difficult for me to think of anyone better for this talk than\
    \ you. As we can see, you are right now sitting in a car. You\u2019re ready to\
    \ give a talk \u2013 to do public speaking \u2013 to be on a podcast in any situation\
    \ \u2013 not only in your studio. This is also a very special moment, because\
    \ typically people see you in the studio. But today is different. We caught Ben\
    \ driving. Right?"

    \ schedule to talk to us. Welcome."
  sec: 179
  time: '2:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I'm excited to be here. I love this topic. I think it's very important for\
    \ anyone that's listening. Anyone can become a great speaker. I\u2019ve definitely\
    \ been a bad speaker before. Anything you want to become better at, you can get\
    \ better through practice. Practice is important. There's a few rules that I've\
    \ learned along the way that are useful, which will hopefully short circuit people's\
    \ learning."
  sec: 188
  time: '3:08'
  who: Ben
- line: "We will definitely get back to these rules. But before we go to that \u2013\
    \ maybe you can just briefly tell us about your background. I know a bit about\
    \ you because I follow you on LinkedIn. Maybe you can just tell us a bit about\
    \ your career journey so far."

  who: Alexey
- header: "Ben\u2019s background"
- line: "I studied chemical engineering in college. I planned on going to medical\
    \ school \u2013 I'm really glad that didn't happen. I don't think I would have\
    \ been very happy being a doctor. I went and worked for Intel and Micron for five\
    \ years in semiconductors. This is semiconductor manufacturing. It was NAND Flash\
    \ memory. I worked in photolithography, process control, fault detection, yield\
    \ analysis. I got a really good sampling of applied data in semiconductors. Then\
    \ I went to work at a hedge fund as a quant, building stock models, and then I\
    \ went and joined a Sequoia Capital company called HireVue and I was their chief\
    \ data scientist. I built out their data science team, I helped them launch their\
    \ AI product. Then four years ago, I got the itch to go do a startup that I co-founded\
    \ with David Gonzalez. That was a deep learning auto ML startup called zef.ai.\
    \ We were acquired by DataRobot a year ago, and I've been working for Data Robot\
    \ ever since."
  sec: 234
  time: '3:54'
  who: Ben
- line: "I actually didn't know that it was acquired. I didn't know that part of the\
    \ story. Congratulations. A bit late, maybe \u2013 but better late than never."
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, it's so funny going to do a startup. It's 100 times harder than you\
    \ thought it would be. I feel like after going through that process, if someone's\
    \ a founder, I feel like they're a brother or sister to me automatically. Even\
    \ if they're a competitor. There's just a very special thing \u2013 a special\
    \ place in my heart for people that understand the pains of payroll and delivering\
    \ on contracts."

  who: Ben
- header: AI evangelism
- line: What is evangelism? What does an AI chief evangelist do?
  sec: 340
  time: '5:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Evangelism \u2013 that's something that a lot of tech companies have. Someone\
    \ who's an evangelist, they could be a professional speaker, or be a frequent\
    \ speaker where they're out speaking. For my role, it's not just evangelizing\
    \ the Data Robot products, but figuring out how to evangelize AI. So it\u2019\
    s \u201CHow do we get companies excited about using AI, even if they don't want\
    \ to use our particular product? How do we get people\u2026\u201D You know, thinking\
    \ about the art of the possible. \u201CHow can we stir the creative juices and\
    \ get them thinking about \u2018What could they do this year with AI?\u2019\u201D\
    \ For some people, I joke and say, I'm the \u201CAI missionary\u201D. If you didn't\
    \ think your company needed AI, there's a good chance I can convince you otherwise\
    \ \u2013 with the right format."
  sec: 364
  time: '6:04'
  who: Ben
- line: "To be a little bit more specific. I see evangelism sitting in between product\
    \ and engineering and marketing. Marketing for a tech company is very complicated,\
    \ because a lot of the marketing can be technical. You never want to have marketing\
    \ that feels misleading, or it's incorrect or embarrassing. Because for people\
    \ that are traditionally marketing, they might not have the technical background\
    \ to get the messaging right, so a lot of times I'm reviewing blog content, and\
    \ some of the messaging stuff. For me that's a lot of fun, because it feels like\
    \ it's a tough challenge. If you and I are competing on writing a blog article\
    \ about AI (or anyone listening) if we're competing together, how can you \u2013\
    \ and this all goes back to speaking \u2013 how can you create content that changes\
    \ an audience or moves them emotionally? The criticism I'll throw out to end this\
    \ rant is \u2013 the common criticism, is that people fall into the rational mindset\
    \ and that's the features and speeds. So it\u2019s \u201CI want you to like my\
    \ product, because it has one more feature than the competition,\u201D or \u201C\
    I want you to buy my hardware because it's a little faster than NVidia or Intel.\u201D\
    \ That's a very weak argument. Because humans like to make emotional decisions\
    \ and then they like to confirm their emotional decisions with rational insights.\
    \ The reverse doesn't really work. To just sell you on rational arguments. Yeah,\
    \ I love studying that part of it."
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Ben
- line: "So, your role is to speak in public \u2013 to promote AI and to promote your\
    \ company as well. Can you also say that you\u2019re kind of an editor in a blog?\
    \ So you also review posts?"
  sec: 514
  time: '8:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. We're also starting up a program this year where we're going to be\
    \ doing active research. I'm still programming, I\u2019m still doing AI applications.\
    \ But normally, when you do R&D, it answers to products and it answers to customer\
    \ needs, where this will be very different. I'm very excited about it this year,\
    \ where we're doing R&D that answers to the attention needs of the market. So\
    \ it\u2019s \u201CCan we do an AI application that is inspiring?\u201D We need\
    \ an AI application that's relatable. Can we do an AI application that furthers\
    \ this cause of \u201Ceveryone needs AI?\u201D That's a very exciting thing for\
    \ me to be working on this year."
  sec: 531
  time: '8:51'
  who: Ben
- line: "The last thing I'll say is, really all of this is about understanding of\
    \ process. It really isn't about me speaking, it's about \u201CCan I understand\
    \ the recipe, or the process, for developing an excellent keynote?\u201D or training\
    \ someone else to go give it instead? That's where things get really exciting\
    \ because you always want to\u2026 You hear people say \u201Cnail it and scale\
    \ it with product\u201D but that's also true with individuals \u2013 it's true\
    \ with yourself, and it's also true with marketing. If you can nail a process,\
    \ then you can critique it, you can measure it, and you can scale it. So my obsession\
    \ is around scaling."
  sec: 577
  time: '9:37'
  who: Ben
- line: "A way of scaling it\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it's a bit ambitious, but\
    \ being on this podcast, and then talking about public speaking is kind of a way\
    \ of scaling and educating other people how to do public speaking?"
  sec: 618
  time: '10:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So for anyone listening, if they can go give a better talk about AI
    that motivates an audience and changes them, that honestly helps me.
  sec: 638
  time: '10:38'
  who: Ben
- line: "Do you know if there's any difference between evangelism and developer advocacy?\
    \ Are they synonymous? Maybe they\u2019re a bit different?"
  sec: 650
  time: '10:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe there's some overlap there. There could be some overlap. Some of these
    titles are a little funny. Because what do you actually do? I think you can look
    at different companies that have evangelism roles and what they actually do could
    be very different between the two of them,
  sec: 661
  time: '11:01'
  who: Ben
- line: "It's like data science, where you don't really know what a company means\
    \ by \u201Cdata science\u201D until you actually see a job description and talk\
    \ to them and figure out what they actually need."
  sec: 680
  time: '11:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. I do like thinking of evangelism as fitting in between marketing\
    \ and engineering. They have to know both worlds. For me, I really liked being\
    \ stuck in the middle. At HireVue, I was stuck in the middle, between the data\
    \ science team and the IO psychologists. The IO psychologists, they're the ones\
    \ that develop hiring assessments \u2013 you're gonna go fill out this assessment\
    \ to go work at the bank or something and they want to flesh out your personality\
    \ traits and map that to potential performance in the future. I love being in\
    \ the middle. When you're in the middle, you can understand both sides. You suddenly\
    \ have a very useful perspective. If you're just in marketing, you're not going\
    \ to appreciate engineering, and you're not going to even understand how to communicate\
    \ it. If you're just in engineering, you're going to fall prey to the rational\
    \ mindset and a lot of factoids that don't matter emotionally \u2013 they don't\
    \ move the needle. By living in the middle\u2026 maybe, if that's the theme for\
    \ me, I just want to spend my whole career living in the middle of whatever that\
    \ is, whatever the next thing is, I just want to be right in the middle. Because\
    \ you get a very unique point of view."

- line: Now you give one talk a week, right? Even more often, maybe. But I can imagine
    that this wasn't the case for you all the time. Do you remember your first experience
    speaking in public?
  sec: 774
  time: '12:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I think it actually started when I was at Intel and Micron. I remember\
    \ \u2013 I was so excited. If you want to go back in time and find the worst talks\
    \ that Ben Taylor has ever given on planet Earth, they were inside Intel and Micron.\
    \ I remember I was so obsessed\u2026. I had a math minor and at one point in my\
    \ life, I thought I wanted to be a mathematician. I was so obsessed about some\
    \ of this math regarding controllers. This math is pretty intense \u2013 it's\
    \ state space, linear algebra. I remember giving a talk about some breakthrough\
    \ on a certain type of controller for state tracking \u2013 and the math was intense.\
    \ Imagine me sitting you down to walk you through an hour of math. You and I are\
    \ technical, but even today, it'd be like, \u201CI'll pass. No, thank you.\u201D\
    \ I remember giving that talk and I think I wrote the whole talk and it was in\
    \ Beamer or low tech. It was just awful. You should never give a presentation\
    \ in Beamer."
  sec: 789
  time: '13:09'
  who: Ben
- line: "So I'm giving this talk and I remember looking over and there's a senior\
    \ engineer at the end of the table. And these rooms are dark \u2013 we have the\
    \ lights off \u2013 and he's asleep with his head cocked back and his mouth is\
    \ wide open \u2013 just sleeping during my talk. At the time, I think I took offence.\
    \ I just thought, \u201COh my gosh, I can't believe this individual is missing\
    \ out on this good content I'm sharing.\u201D But today I would say \u201CYeah,\
    \ I gave a terrible talk. I didn't understand my audience and it was awful.\u201D\
    \ Today I care a lot about the audience feedback, because it's a point of reference.\
    \ \u201CDid you give a good talk?\u201D \u201CCould you have given a better talk?\u201D\
    \ You need to consult with the audience after the talk, to find out. You're not\
    \ going to make everyone happy. You're always gonna have some people \u2014 no\
    \ matter how good of a speaker you are \u2014  you're always gonna have some people\
    \ that didn't like the talk or they've got some criticism. The challenge that\
    \ I fall into is \u2013 I've been criticized for giving talks that are too technical.\
    \ And I've been criticized for giving talks that weren't technical enough \u2013\
    \ and I've had those criticisms on the same talk. That's an example of like, \u201C\
    You're not going to make everyone happy, but there's always room for improvement.\u201D\
    \ I've learned a lot since then. That was eight years ago \u2013 making an engineer\
    \ fall asleep. I gave plenty of terrible talks since then. But my terrible talks\
    \ are becoming less frequent now."
  sec: 848
  time: '14:08'
  who: Ben
- line: So that was the time when you would give one talk a year? I guess it happened
    to you in seven, eight years?
  sec: 944
  time: '15:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I started to speak at HireVue \u2013 they helped my speaking career. When\
    \ I started at HireVue, they needed someone out there talking about AI and data\
    \ science in the HR space. I started going to HR conferences and I think I could\
    \ have made a name for myself right out of the gate. It's interesting, because\
    \ right out of the gate I made a name for myself, maybe not because I was a great\
    \ speaker, but because I was controversial. I was rough around the edges. I remember\
    \ presenting a PsyOp \u2013 I think I was one of the only data science speakers\
    \ there, and I was saying a lot of things that were pretty\u2026 I don't want\
    \ to say disrespectful\u2026 But I remember I gave a talk to an audience and I'm\
    \ essentially telling the entire \u2013 I'm insulting the entire audience."
  sec: 957
  time: '15:57'
  who: Ben
- line: "That's a rule of storytelling. In speaking \u2013 don't insult the audience.\
    \ But I remember insulting the entire audience. I said, \u201CYou guys don't understand\
    \ statistics.\u201D Essentially, I'm insulting the entire industrial occupational\
    \ psychology field. I'm saying \u201CYou guys don't understand statistics, so\
    \ I'm going to teach you how to do proper cross-validation.\u201D This talk was\
    \ seven years ago in Philadelphia and I think I'm showing them how to do K-folding.\
    \ Because I found out they weren't doing that and I was upset about that. I remember\u2026\
    \ and I'm not thinking I'm being a dick, I'm not thinking I'm being mean \u2013\
    \ I just give this talk like, \u201CHey, you guys need to know this. You're welcome.\u201D\
    \ And I remember seeing\u2026 I ran into someone six months later who had been\
    \ at the talk up in Park City, Utah, and they were saying, \u201CHey, remember\
    \ that talk you gave in Philadelphia?\u201D I'm like, \u201COh, yeah.\u201D I'm\
    \ thinking a compliment\u2019s coming, I go, \u201CYeah.\u201D He said, \u201C\
    Yeah, you were a real ass.\u201D I was like, \u201COh! Okay, tell me why.\u201D\
    \ He essentially said \u2013 it was interesting \u2013 because he agreed with\
    \ everything I said\u2026 He said \u201CYou were right about what you said,\u201D\
    \ but he said, \u201CWe didn't like hearing it from you.\u201D And part of that\
    \ \u2013 I don't want to gossip or go down another path \u2013 but it's essentially\
    \ saying, \u201CI'm not an IO psychologist, I'm an outsider. I don't have a PhD\
    \ in IO, and I'm essentially raining on their parade and insulting their career.\u201D"
  sec: 1007
  time: '16:47'
  who: Ben
- line: "I'm not a controversial speaker anymore. There are tricks in storytelling\
    \ where you actually can offend the audience, but you have to be really careful\
    \ how you do it, and you actually don't ever want to leave a talk where the audience\
    \ still feels offended. To finish the thought \u2013 at HireVue, I started doing\
    \ a lot of speaking. I was speaking all over the US, I got to speak in Sydney.\
    \ Then when I went and did our startup \u2013 I started speaking even more. I\
    \ spoke in South Africa, Madrid, Dublin, all over the US."

    \ companies, like, Red Bull, Goldman Sachs, Procter and Gamble, Amazon \u2013\
    \ different companies. Like, a rocket company says, \u201CHey, will you please\
    \ come present to us?\u201D And those invites are coming because some of those\
    \ employees had seen my other talks. For me, that has been some of the most fun\
    \ I've had \u2013 giving private talks to these companies. You meet some really\
    \ interesting people. It's important for the audience to know \u2013 there's nothing\
    \ about me, there's a process here. It's not like I'm better looking or my voice\
    \ sounds better than anyone else. There's nothing about me specifically. There's\
    \ a process here for anyone listening to become a better speaker and to become\
    \ a great speaker."

- line: Let's jump into this process. So what is the process?
  sec: 1188
  time: '19:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: "You have this concept of attention. You walk out on the stage. You being\
    \ the speaker, you're given attention for free. But you can quickly lose it. You\
    \ can imagine if you or myself, were walking out on stage \u2013 COVID\u2019s\
    \ over \u2013 we're gonna walk out in front of an audience of 1000 people, or\
    \ even 100 people. You all have their attention, but they are going to quickly\
    \ decide if they're going to pull out their phones, their laptops, or disengage.\
    \ There's lots of sub topics. One of the sub topics is around the first impression.\
    \ How do you introduce yourself \u2013 what's the best way to introduce yourself?\
    \ But getting into the meat of the talk, I think it's important to have a talk\
    \ that leverages storytelling. You jump in with vivid details, you have a story\
    \ that's engaging. Think of your audience as being like cold taffy \u2013 you\
    \ have to warm them up. You can warm them up with humor, you can warm them up\
    \ with storytelling. If you can warm them up, they're going to be much more receptive\
    \ to the key points you want to share. If I had to simplify the talk, the beginning\
    \ of the talk is the warm up. And that could be storytelling, it could be something\
    \ that's more creative \u2013 maybe something that's silly, nonsensical, surprising.\
    \ There's a lot of emotions you can play with."
  sec: 1194
  time: '19:54'
  who: Ben
- line: "When I would design my talks, I used to write the emotion on every slide\
    \ that I wanted the audience to have. The emotions could be concern, relief, anxiety,\
    \ happiness, sadness \u2013 they can be all the emotions you can imagine \u2013\
    \ and by writing it down on each slide, it would allow me to amplify it. What\
    \ is the goal for the felt audience to experience? I think of it as being a monotonic\
    \ speaker \u2013 no one wants to listen to a monotonic speaker. In the same vein,\
    \ I'm not going to warm up the audience if I just have one emotion. If I have\
    \ this whipsaw, and warm them up \u2013 and humor can be a very powerful tool\
    \ for that."

- header: Key takeaways and call to action
- line: "It's also really important to have key takeaways. If I just have a talk that\
    \ is storytelling, warming them up \u2013 then the end, you might say, \u201C\
    Well, what was the point of this talk?\u201D And that'd be a fair criticism. \u201C\
    What is the point of this talk? Is this a storytelling festival? It's supposed\
    \ to be a tech conference.\u201D You need both. It's really important to decide\
    \ what is the gift that you will give to the audience? That probably sounds arrogant\
    \ to say. You need to give the audience something for free \u2013 some learned\
    \ insight, some key points. If they never see you again, they need to be able\
    \ to leave and say, \u201CThank you. That is useful for me.\u201D You need to\
    \ identify what that is. Identify the warm up, identify what the key takeaways\
    \ that they can have. It's hard because there can't be a lot of them. I can't\
    \ have 10 key takeaways \u2013 people don't remember. The other thing for talk\
    \ is \u2014 they need to remember it. If I give a talk, and everyone says, \u201C\
    Oh, that was a great talk.\u201D And they wake up the next morning, \u201COh,\
    \ I forgot what the talk was about.\u201D It wasn't a great talk \u2013 that was\
    \ a terrible talk. Decide what the key takeaways are. There's other tricks you\
    \ can have in the talk where you can have a call to action, you can have something\
    \ at the end where you try to engage people to go to a certain place, go watch\
    \ something or reach out to you specifically for further questions. Sometimes\
    \ people forget the call to action."

  who: Ben
- line: "You mentioned warm up. When you get to the meat of the presentation, you\
    \ need to use storytelling. Then think which kind of emotions you want to appeal\
    \ to. Then you really need to think of the key takeaway messages, there should\
    \ be very few of them, 1-3. At the end, there is a call to action \u2013 what\
    \ do you want the audience to do? What do you want them to do after this talk?\
    \ These are the main elements of a talk."
