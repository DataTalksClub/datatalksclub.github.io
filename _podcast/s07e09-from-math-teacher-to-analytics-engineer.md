short: From Math Teacher to Analytics Engineer
title: From Math Teacher to Analytics Engineer
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about transitioning to analytics. And we have a special
    guest today, Juan Pablo, Juan Pablo was a math teacher who switched careers and
    became an analytics engineer. He currently works at Amazon. And he also mentors
    at the University of Washington, where he helps students get their first data
    role. Welcome.
  sec: 2
  time: 0:02
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be invited to the DataTalks club.
  sec: 104
  time: '1:44'
  who: Juan Pablo
- header: Juan Pablo’s background
- line: Thanks for joining us. Before we go into our main topic of transition into
    analytics to analytics engineering, let's start with your background. Can you
    tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: I started as a mathematics graduate student, my goal was to become a math
    professor.  That seems like a lifetime ago. After that, I left my programme, and
    I started taking statistics courses. I wanted to get into data analytics. But
    at the time I was not ready. So the easiest path to a job was teaching math. That's
    what I had experience with. And it was close to my original goal of being a professor.
    So I ended up being a math teacher.
  sec: 128
  time: '2:08'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: When I was teaching the Intermediate Value Theorem for the fifth time, I realized
    I cannot do this much longer. I need to make a change. I need to get a job in
    Data Analytics. We can get later to why data analytics. I started working towards
    that transition.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: My first role was at a consulting company in the Seattle Washington area.
    My second role was with T-Mobile. T-Mobile was a client [of the consulting company].
    That's very common in consulting where the client poaches you, or asks you to
    join them full time. I was in consulting for about a year. I was with T-Mobile
    for a little over two years. Then I've been with Amazon for two years and one
    month. And here I am.
  sec: 197
  time: '3:17'
  who: Juan Pablo
- header: Data engineering resources
- line: I've been mentoring at the University of Washington. This is my fourth year.
    And we met online. I've been active on LinkedIn and Twitter for the past six months.
  sec: 225
  time: '3:45'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Thanks for advertising our data engineering course. This tweet really took
    off and a lot of people saw the course because of your tweets. Thanks for doing
    that.
  sec: 246
  time: '4:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: My pleasure. I saw it was shared by someone from England or Scotland. That
    tweet didn't get much traction. I opened the link, and that's how I found out
    about DataTalks.Club. I thought, "This is pure gold. This is a valuable learning
    resource, a valuable community. It deserves more attention." People are always
    asking for resources for data science and data analytics. But I've been around
    long enough to realize that there aren't enough resources for data engineering.
    So, when I saw that one, I thought "I need to share it so that it gets more visibility.
    Hopefully people will join right away. But if not, at least it's in their radar."
  sec: 256
  time: '4:16'
  who: Juan Pablo
- header: Teaching calculus
- line: Thanks. You mentioned this intermediate value theorem. Is it something from
    Game Theory?
  sec: 310
  time: '5:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. Intermediate value theorem should be from calculus.
  sec: 315
  time: '5:15'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: So, you were teaching calculus?
  sec: 325
  time: '5:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I was teaching calculus in high school. It was a private high school.
    And I also was a teaching assistant when I was a graduate student. I always took
    the same course - calculus one. So I had done it four times in college and one
    time in high school. I was at the board, and something clicked. "I don't want
    to turn 50 and still do the intermediate value theorem". So, something was planted
    in my mind then. I started doing more research, I started studying at night and
    - it's been six years since then.
  sec: 328
  time: '5:28'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: You're probably quite good at taking derivatives, integrals and using this
    chain rule stuff.
  sec: 378
  time: '6:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: To be honest, I haven't done it in a while. As a matter of fact, I can still
    do the chain rule by memory. For integration by parts, I might have to revisit
    the theorem and then be able to do it again.
  sec: 387
  time: '6:27'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: I was taking a deep learning course. In deep learning, you have backpropagation,
    where you need to apply the chain rule a lot. I was having a hard time doing back
    propagation for batch normalisation. The derivative for it is just mind-blowing.
    But, I guess, you can do this with your eyes closed.
  sec: 407
  time: '6:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hopefully. When you think about the chain rule, I'm sure at some point, you
    must have seen it either in high school or in university. Unless you go into math
    or statistics, you might not revisit it again. It's common that people forget.
    Funny that you bring that up. When I was a teacher, sometimes students would ask
    me, "but when will we need this?" And I would try to politely change the subject.
  sec: 436
  time: '7:16'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Now you can say "for deep learning". At least, for the theory part. But now,
    you can do whatever you want with TensorFlow, and it will take care of computing
    the derivatives. I'm not sure if it was really needed. Maybe at some point of
    my life I understood how it works. Now I don't.
  sec: 477
  time: '7:57'
  who: Alexey
- header: Transitioning to Analytics
- line: So, you were a math teacher. You were tired of teaching Intermediate Value
    Theorem for the fifth time. And then you went to research. Right? Is this how
    it happened?
  sec: 504
  time: '8:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Would you like me to talk about the transition?
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Yes. How exactly you went from the point when you realised, "This is not for
    me. I do not want to turn 50 and still teach that" to the point when you got hired?
    How did it actually look like? What were you doing to go to the industry and start
    working as an analytics engineer?
  sec: 520
  time: '8:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I was a graduate student in math, I was mainly taking math courses. But
    I knew that I wanted to leave the program at some point - most likely after the
    masters. So I started taking courses in biostatistics and statistics. That's how
    I became familiar with hypothesis testing, linear statistical models, SAS, statistical
    software, and then some R programming. We're talking about 2012/2013, when data
    science and data analytics were starting to become popular. Some of my classmates
    also dropped out of the program to join software engineering bootcamps.
  sec: 554
  time: '9:14'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: I was a teacher, so I decided to leave the school. It was a private school,
    so you're contracted every year. They offered me to come back the next year. I
    declined the offer. At night, I would watch YouTube videos. I would go through
    other people's GitHub profiles. I would try to strengthen my R programming skills
    and to familiarise myself with database packages in R, with machine learning packages,
    and how to use them. I didn't know at the time that I needed to learn SQL - it's
    what I use most of the time now. I didn't know about Tableau. I used R for data
    visualization. But it started.
  sec: 616
  time: '10:16'
  who: Juan Pablo
- header: Data Analytics bootcamp
- line: I was in the middle of the country, in the Midwest. So after my year ended,
    I moved to the west coast, where the jobs are, and where the tech money is in
    the United States. Before that, I actually lived with my parents. And I joined
    a bootcamp in the area. There were multiple bootcamps. Being a teacher, I went
    for the cheapest bootcamp. Lesson learned.
  sec: 681
  time: '11:21'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Would you do it differently if you were doing this switch today? Would you
    not go to the cheapest one?
  sec: 719
  time: '11:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Yes, I would go into another one with a bigger network. Because it''s ultimately
    about the network. But that''s how you learn, so I just have to live with it.
    I met some interesting people, so I don''t fully regret it. But I have to acknowledge
    that I got what I paid for. At least there they gave me a roadmap and made me
    aware of the things that I didn''t know: SQL, Tableau, Power BI, some software
    tools. They make you build dashboards and share them with the org. Most companies
    would prefer to use a software tool like Tableau, Power BI, QuickSight'
  sec: 726
  time: '12:06'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: The bootcamp was about analytics, not about data science?
  sec: 784
  time: '13:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was mainly analytics. They advertised it as both, but it was mainly analytics.
    And it seemed easier to get a data analyst job than a data scientist job, particularly
    with no internships or no tangible experience. And at some point, the time you're
    looking for jobs grows longer, and you will take anything. It made me aware of
    my learning gaps.
  sec: 787
  time: '13:07'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: It also made me aware that they cannot guarantee me a job. I need to go out
    and hunt. I need to network. I need to meet people. And I would do that. Actually,
    most of the content that I share online and in the mentorship sessions with the
    University of Washington or outside of it - it comes from that time period in
    my life. I was searching for a job, and I wasn't landing one. It actually took
    me nine months. It was painful. I was frustrated.
  sec: 832
  time: '13:52'
  who: Juan Pablo
- header: Getting money while studying
- line: You didn't have any income during this time, right? You quit your math job.
    And you also were taking bootcamp. It wasn't free, right? So you needed leave
    on your savings.
  sec: 874
  time: '14:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: I did. Also - something I don't share in my tweets - but I did two things.
    I worked at a restaurant. Working at a restaurant with a fixed schedule wasn’t
    working for me once I started getting interviews. So I started driving Uber. I
    was an Uber driver for some time. It gave me the flexibility to do it.
  sec: 887
  time: '14:47'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: You should share this. This is like "From Uber driver to analytics engineer".
    It sounds much cooler than from “math teacher”.
  sec: 923
  time: '15:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: It does sound much cooler. But the reality is, if I were to share "from Uber
    driver to analytics engineer", it makes it sound like I had no education. The
    reality is that I did. I just needed to get myself on the interview. So I don't
    want to be misleading. But yes, it does sound cool. I tried multiple things. You
    reached out to me about one specific Tweet where I say "eight tips and alternatives
    on how to land an analytics engineering job". I tried many of those.
  sec: 934
  time: '15:34'
  who: Juan Pablo
- header: Going to meetups to get a job
- line: Moving back to the story. Back in 2016, people would work online, but network
    in person. Luckily, I was in the Seattle area. There was a neighbourhood called
    Pioneer Square. They had a venue where they hosted events - like meetup events.
    If you go to meetup.com, you would get Python events, software development events,
    data science events. I went to that place 10 or 15 times during my search. During
    one of those times I met this man who was hiring. He had a consulting startup.
    We chatted, and I shared my resume with him. Eventually, he would hire me, but
    at the beginning he ghosted me. But through someone else, he received my resume
    for the second time. When he got it for the second time, after a couple of months,
    he reached out to me. He said, "I guess, you're still looking? And you're not
    going to give up. So I want to interview you." And then I got the job.
  sec: 972
  time: '16:12'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: That's such a nice story. I imagine it was quite difficult for you because
    you needed to drive Uber. It must be frustrating to apply and then not hear back.
    That's quite admirable that you did this for nine months. As I understood, because
    of the network, you managed to first talk to this person; and then, through somebody
    else, talk again. This is the power of the network, right? You wouldn't be able
    to do this just by clicking a button on the website, right?
  sec: 1071
  time: '17:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Correct. Clicking "Submit" works for some, but it didn''t work for me at
    the time. It works for me now: my labels are different. After working for Amazon,
    people will give you more opportunities than when you''re a high school teacher
    or a college graduate without any experience. So in those situations, you have
    to hustle.'
  sec: 1110
  time: '18:30'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: It's like social proof, or I don't know what you call it. People see, "This
    person works at Amazon. They must be quite good. Let's interview them." But when
    they see a math teacher, they have 100 other math teachers. they are "Okay, how
    do we select the math teacher we want to interview now?"
  sec: 1137
  time: '18:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Was it the case for you? I imagine in the bootcamp, there were many people
    from different backgrounds. Then it was quite difficult to set yourself apart
    from others like you.
  sec: 1157
  time: '19:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: There were 10 of us. Six or seven went back to doing what they were doing
    before. I am friends with a couple of people from the boot camp. Two are in data
    science. One is in software sales. Everybody else went back to doing what they
    were doing.
  sec: 1174
  time: '19:34'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Do you think it's because it was the cheapest bootcamp? Or because of other
    reasons? Market was tough back then for people without experience?
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Alexey
- header: Looking for uncrowded doors
- line: The market is tough for people without experience. If you're in that group,
    you have to hustle. You have to look for alternative ways to get in front of a
    hiring manager. You have to think outside the box. You have to look for the uncrowded
    doors. If you look for the crowded doors, click "Submit", or even a job fair,
    it's going to be tough. In those crowded doors, you have the top applicants coming
    in.
  sec: 1217
  time: '20:17'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: What are these alternative ways that are less crowded? Clicking "Apply" is
    a crowded way, a lot of people do this. Job fairs are also not the best approach.
    What are the better alternatives? You mentioned meetup, I guess, this is one of
    them. Is there anything else?
  sec: 1266
  time: '21:06'
  who: Alexey
- header: Using LinkedIn
- line: I have this tweet in front of me. First, if you're on LinkedIn, it's a big
    plus. But just being on LinkedIn is not enough. It helps if you're active on LinkedIn.
    Most people use LinkedIn the wrong way. People can do more than just liking a
    post. People can do more than re-sharing an article and not writing anything about
    it. People can do more than sharing a PDF of somebody else's work. We can do more
    than just saying "My company just went public".
  sec: 1286
  time: '21:26'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: I believe that everyone has something to say. Everyone has a journey. People
    are out there dying to hear what you have to say. It might not get traction the
    first few times. But you'll eventually find your voice, your tribe, your people.
    So, LinkedIn must be up to date. And be active there. If you are shy, it's fine
    initially. But you can comment on other people's posts, something beyond "I like
    this", or "I agree with you".
  sec: 1349
  time: '22:29'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Ask questions. Add value. Don't pick fights. That'll go a long way. It brings
    visibility to your profile. And if your profile makes it obvious that you are
    looking for work and that you're serious about it. If you have a portfolio, make
    it easy for people to land on that portfolio. Then the conversation is different.
  sec: 1394
  time: '23:14'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Another one. Your resume should always be up-to-date. If you have a link to
    it, share it. You're looking for work, and someone approaches you. They say, "could
    I take a look at your resume?" You tell them "I have to go back home and get on
    my laptop so that I can share it with you via email." You just lost an opportunity.
    It should be "Let me just send it to you via LinkedIn on my phone right now".
    Or a QR code, or a link.
  sec: 1427
  time: '23:47'
  who: Juan Pablo
- header: Portfolio
- line: A third one is to have a portfolio. It doesn't have to be the most advanced
    portfolio. But it should be a link where people can see what you've done. Especially
    when you're trying to land that first job. Since I mainly was familiar with R,
    I used rpubs.com. In fact, when I went to see it, I could see that the posts were
    up, but when I clicked on them, they didn't load anymore. It's been six years.
    But that's what I used.
  sec: 1463
  time: '24:23'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: I remember that there's R markdown language. In RStudio, you can quickly type
    something, click a button, and then it gets published. Right?
  sec: 1507
  time: '25:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it'll create an R Markdown file, and it'll push it.
  sec: 1515
  time: '25:15'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: I remember doing this as well when I was learning R. That's a nice thing.
    So you used that for your portfolio and in rpubs you had all your all the projects
    you did in R, right?
  sec: 1521
  time: '25:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. It had my projects in R. It was mostly data wrangling, exploratory
    data analysis, data visualisation. I used a library with Google Maps - it was
    useful to display maps, heat maps, locations. And I had some machine learning,
    some basic classification and regression models. The idea was for people to see
    that I was serious enough, and that I had something up.
  sec: 1537
  time: '25:37'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: How many projects do you need to have in your portfolio to show that you're
    serious? 1, 2, 3, 5?
  sec: 1589
  time: '26:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Three is good enough. We're talking about entry-level roles. My first role
    didn't pay much. So I think it was good enough. I actually had maybe seven or
    eight.
  sec: 1599
  time: '26:39'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: I often get the question, "How many projects should I have? Should I wait
    until I have that magic number to share it?" No. I will always say this, any portfolio
    is better than no portfolio. Even if you have one, just put it up there. Socialise
    your work. Share it on LinkedIn, on Twitter, on hashnode, on medium. Let people
    see it. Some will think it is not good enough. Some will laugh at it. They're
    not going to laugh at it online, they're not going to share publicly how disappointed
    they are in you. But if someone finds it interesting, clicks on it and eventually
    lands on your LinkedIn page, and maybe connects with you, it's a win.
  sec: 1617
  time: '26:57'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: If you're looking for a job, you could have 100 rejections. But if you get
    hired by one company, then you made it.
  sec: 1679
  time: '27:59'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: You just need only one successful application, right?
  sec: 1689
  time: '28:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. That's it. And you're in.
  sec: 1692
  time: '28:12'
  who: Juan Pablo
- header: Talking to people on meetups
- line: Let's say you're on a meetup. And you want to... make a move. You see somebody
    and you want to say, "I'm looking for a job". How do you do this?
  sec: 1699
  time: '28:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would go to these meetups. I was excited about the presented topics. But
    after two or three meetups, I realised that I'm here to get a job. Initially,
    I would talk to the presenters, which were people in their 20s-30s. But quickly,
    I started realising that they are junior or intermediate data scientists. I need
    to talk to the managers. So, at the time, my strategy was to sit in the back,
    so that I can scan everyone in the room. And I picked out people who looked a
    bit older - 40s and up.
  sec: 1713
  time: '28:33'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Typically, at the end of the meetup, or at the beginning, there is a networking
    event. They are giving out some food and sometimes alcoholic drinks. I worked
    in restaurants throughout my undergraduate career. My parents had restaurants
    when I was growing up in Latin America. That environment was always familiar to
    me.
  sec: 1766
  time: '29:26'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: So, I would just approach them and say, "Hello, how are you? My name is JP".
    JP is easier for most Americans to pronounce. I would introduce myself. I would
    ask them who they are and what they do. I wouldn't tell them that I needed a job.
    I would try to connect with them and be their friend. At some point, the question
    will arise. If it doesn't arise from them, you can say, "by the way, I'm looking
    for a data scientist or a data analyst role. My background is in mathematics.
    I used to be in education. I've been creating some small projects. Would you happen
    to know who's hiring?" Then the conversation starts. If they don't want to help,
    they're not going to say "no", but they'll tell you that they don't know anyone.
    But if they do, they'll at least connect with you on LinkedIn. And they might
    share your profile with someone else.
  sec: 1797
  time: '29:57'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: How many people did you need to talk to find that one who eventually helped
    you to get a job?
  sec: 1864
  time: '31:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know... Maybe like 30-40 people. Some people didn't. They were not
    hiring. Some people were just curious about data or software engineering, but
    they were not in the field. Maybe they're in insurance, they're considering making
    the switch. Eventually I met this person who hired me and helped me.
  sec: 1872
  time: '31:12'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: 'If I summarise it: look for people who look like managers, not juniors. Talk
    to them, and say "by the way, I''m looking for a job".'
  sec: 1898
  time: '31:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know if this will work for everyone, but it worked for me. I can only
    share my experience.
  sec: 1913
  time: '31:53'
  who: Juan Pablo
- header: Eight tips to get your first analytics job
- line: In that tweet that we mentioned. I think you have it pinned. The tweet says
    "Getting your first job in data analytics isn't always easy. Blind applications
    don't work for everyone. Sometimes they only lead to rejections. These eight tips
    and alternatives can help you land your first data analytic jobs." We already
    talked about LinkedIn. Did we talk about everything from that tweet or is there
    something we didn't cover yet?
  sec: 1921
  time: '32:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: We talked about LinkedIn. We talked about having your resume handy. We talked
    about building a portfolio. I would love to talk about the rest.
  sec: 1947
  time: '32:27'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: I had to reach out to a number of recruiters and hiring managers. In my desperation,
    I crafted a message. I also did some FreeCodeCamp web development courses. So
    I created my own website back then. Now I have a new one created with a Website
    Builder. But back then I crafted a message saying I was a data analyst with some
    web development background. I would reach out to recruiters and hiring managers
    on LinkedIn. I sent 200 or more of such messages. I got about five replies. One
    led to an opportunity. But I also had the opportunity from the meetup. So I chose
    that one.

  sec: 2024
  time: '33:44'
  who: Alexey

    a temporary trial period. I ended up going for the full-time one.

- header: Consider contracts and temporary roles
- line: Number five. Consider contracts and temporals. I have met multiple aspiring
    data scientists and analysts who were looking for their ideal company. The ideal
    company could be Amazon or Facebook. They will not consider a contract role that
    pays maybe half, but will give them the experience. So they will sometimes turn
    down these opportunities or won't even look at them. They'll continue looking
    at the big companies. Then the months pass and they still have nothing. They have
    no job, no money and no experience. So I would consider contract roles. That's
    how many people get started.
  sec: 2046
  time: '34:06'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: What's a good place to find such roles?
  sec: 2102
  time: '35:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: In the US, dice.com is the best place. If you want to stand out from the crowd,
    call the recruiters on dice. You click on a job posting and you see the recruiter
    John Smith. Many times they post their number. Just call them. Ask them questions.
    "I'm curious. I want to know what it's like? Who's the client?" Most of them won't
    share that. "How long is the contract? What's the hourly pay?" If they tell you
    $50 an hour, multiply that by two - that's 100k a year. That's a quick way of
    calculating it.
  sec: 2106
  time: '35:06'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: What about places like Upwork, and Fiverr? There are freelancers there who
    are doing data analytics. If somebody wants to get the report, they go to Upwork
    and find people there. Do you think it's a good place? Do you have any experience
    with this? Maybe you know somebody who used it to get experience?
  sec: 2148

  who: Alexey

  sec: 2201
  time: '36:41'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Do you use it as a client?
  sec: 2217
  time: '36:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Yes, never as a service provider. My take on it, as a client: if you live
    in the United States, or Canada, or Western Europe, then you are the most expensive
    by default. You''re competing with people from other countries who can offer more
    competitive pricing. That puts you at a disadvantage.'
  sec: 2219
  time: '36:59'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: And dice focuses on North America, right?
  sec: 2251
  time: '37:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: It does definitely focus on North America. I don't know if they are available
    outside of North America. Dice looks for contract and temp roles in your market
    where you need to be in the market - in that geographical location where the job
    is. If not in the same city, at least in the same country.

  sec: 2287
  time: '38:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'I hear this a lot: "I don''t have enough experience, and I don''t know how
    to get it". You can help a nonprofit with a project. It might not be the ideal
    project. But it is a project that is helping an organisation. It''s real. I don''t
    want to say "business case", because it''s non-profit, but it''s a real-world
    problem that needs to be solved. That''s an opportunity.'
  sec: 2292
  time: '38:12'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: You can either reach out directly to them, or there's a website called "catch
    a fire". It's a platform that connects you with nonprofits who need technical
    work. You help them out, and then you ask "Is it okay If I share this, if I put
    this on my portfolio? I will mask the numbers, but I want to share that I've done
    something for a company". You can list on your resume that you were a data analyst
    consultant for three months. That - in my eyes - is real-world experience. That's
    an alternative. It's very different from just clicking Submit.

- line: 'Number seven: create your own internship. This is what I did with the linkedin
    messages. When I got offered that temporary job, or temporary probation period.
    You reach out to someone, typically a smaller medium company. You''re not going
    to reach out to Google and try to pitch this to them. They''ll be open to listen.'
  sec: 2379
  time: '39:39'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: You reach out to them. You introduce yourself. You introduce your portfolio,
    what you bring to the table, how you can add value to them. Briefly. Be concise.
    Then you say, "I'm willing to work for you for 2-3 months for <an hourly amount>"
    - typically something that is a lot cheaper than a full timer. "After that three
    months period, you can decide to hire me or not."
  sec: 2404
  time: '40:04'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: The good thing here is that if they give you a job - great, you have a job.
    But even if they don't, you have three months of experience. During those three
    months, you will prove yourself. But you will also have time to apply to other
    places. Because now you are a data analyst. Sure, you're in a three month probation
    period. But I don't think anybody needs to know that. If you want, write "intern"
    or "temp". You can spin it in any way you want. But you have the experience now.
  sec: 2439
  time: '40:39'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: So the 200 messages you mentioned were about that? You wrote "This is me.
    This is the kind of work I'm looking for. Would you consider me for a three months
    internship?". Right?
  sec: 2477
  time: '41:17'
  who: Alexey

    your company."
  sec: 2495
  time: '41:35'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Does it have to be personalised? Probably there was a line in this message
    that you would change for every company? Or would you just copy and paste?
  sec: 2500
  time: '41:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would just copy and paste. I targeted small-medium sized marketing agencies
    who need some analytics work and potentially some web development work - in my
    area. I also targeted them in cities where I had lived. I didn't go to school
    in Seattle, Washington. I went to school in Iowa. So, if I send a message to a
    company in Iowa, I would say "I'm an Iowa grad". So that they think "he's one
    of us".
  sec: 2512

  who: Juan Pablo

  sec: 2555

  who: Juan Pablo
- line: Well, it worked, right? You said that there was an opportunity at the end.
  sec: 2561
  time: '42:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, there was an opportunity. They offered me $20 an hour, which for a tech
    role in Seattle is peanuts. I think Starbucks offers $20 an hour to be a barista.
  sec: 2565
  time: '42:45'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: But you cannot sell the experience later. You get the same money for being
    a barista. This is not something you can put on your CV when you look for a job.
    But this one, even though it pays $20, it goes to your CV. Then you can sell it
    to the next company.
  sec: 2582
  time: '43:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's a long-term investment. I don't even know if "investment" because you're
    actually making money from it.

  who: Juan Pablo
- header: Networking
- line: The last one is network. Put yourself out there. Reach out to friends, family,
    alumni in your network - if you went to a specific school. Go to virtual meetups.
    Join specific groups on LinkedIn. There's also Slack. I'm sure that there are
    many that I don't take advantage of right now. But they're out there. Even Facebook
    has groups on software engineering. Try them out. See what works for you. Don't
    give up after the first message. No one will offer you something on the first
    message. It takes time.

    - you were taking some courses on FreeCodeCamp. But you used a website builder
    for the website you have right now. What is this builder?

    with them. I've reached out to them on Twitter multiple times for tweaking of
    my website. They were very helpful.
  sec: 2727
  time: '45:27'

    who are looking for a place to host their portfolio.
  sec: 2745

    you can click on it.

  who: Juan Pablo
- line: It costs some money, does it?
  sec: 2768
  time: '46:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: It does. It was more competitive in terms of pricing than the paid version
    of WordPress, and Squarespace. And I don't know if it's the nerd in me, but I
    like the idea of trying something new. They are inLithuania and they're competing
    with the big guns here in the US. So I thought I want to support this venture.
  sec: 2769

  who: Juan Pablo
- line: If you have to drive an Uber to actually survive, then maybe you are not ready
    to pay for a website. What are the good alternatives that are free?
  sec: 2816
  time: '46:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: WordPress has a free tier. It'll just say "WordPress" in the URL instead of
    your name. Rpubs is another one. You can always host your work on GitHub. You
    can use hashnode to describe your project. At the very top, somewhere in the middle,
    and at the end, you say "link to code". If you don't have the money, you have
    to get creative. I am in a position now in my life where I'm okay paying for hosting
    and a website builder to get a clean URL and a clean look on my website.
  sec: 2836
  time: '47:16'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: That's not the most important thing, right? If you're looking for a job, a
    GitHub page will do.
  sec: 2892
  time: '48:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, a GitHub page would do. But you have to make it easy for those who land
    on your page to know where's what. It's okay to be redundant and over explain.
    It's much better than having no description. Most people don't want to look just
    at the code. You need to have some comments. You need to know what it accomplishes.
  sec: 2899
  time: '48:19'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: When I hire, if I look at the CV of a candidate, only in rare occasions, I
    would actually go and check the code. I have only limited time and many candidates.
    I don't have time to check the code of every candidate. Maybe at the end of the
    funnel, but not at the beginning. Definitely not before the first interview. So,
    for each project in GitHub it's a good idea to have a good description. It helps
    to quickly get an idea what the project is about, instead of trying to figure
    out this from the code.

- header: I’m a math teacher. What should I learn first?
- line: 'We have a few questions. The first question: "I currently work as a math
    teacher, and I want to switch careers to data field". Sounds familiar? "Can you
    give tips or tricks to do it?" I think you already gave quite a few suggestions.
    This question was asked before we covered that part. The question continues "What
    should they learn first?". I think you''d go with SQL, right?'
  sec: 2974
  time: '49:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely SQL. Start with SQL, with a visualisation tool, and one programming
    language. Being a math person, I was always attracted to R. But if someone comes
    to me and asks "R or Python?", I would suggest Python over R. It's more marketable
    in my opinion.
  sec: 3004
  time: '50:04'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: I just shared this tweet. It describes how I would transition from teacher
    to data analyst, analytics engineer or business intelligence engineer. In usual
    Twitter mode, it screams at you. It says "I was a broke teacher". But it's to
    get people to click on it. There's useful information there.
  sec: 3042
  time: '50:42'

    enough for the start? And then use the skills to build the portfolio.
  sec: 3083
  time: '51:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Use your skills to build a portfolio. Look at business analytics or data science
    use cases. Familiarise yourself with what type of problems will come to you. Also
    look up data analyst interviews. It's good to familiarise yourself with the interview
    process.
  sec: 3095
  time: '51:35'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: I don't know who this person is. Perhaps they're different from me. But teachers,
    STEM students - math, physics, stats, computer science students - think that they
    should know everything before going into an interview. Or they think they should
    be "good enough". "I'm just going to study the fundamentals. And then I'm going
    to crack the interview."
  sec: 3122
  time: '52:02'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: You should familiarise yourself with how the interview is structured. There
    are commonalities across multiple companies. Typically, the big companies set
    the pace. And then everybody else follows. Or most smaller companies follow.

    We consume data from upstream teams, and then make it available to troubleshooting
    consultants across nine different countries. It's a lot of ingesting data, building
    pipelines, adding business logic, and eventually creating dashboards for reporting
    or to accelerate the troubleshooting process.

  sec: 3214

    company. I know that Apple has analytics engineers. Netflix does too. Many of
    the new startups are calling it analytics engineer.

    job?

  sec: 3261
  time: '54:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: At my first job I was not building any pipelines. So the best way to describe
    it is data analyst or data analyst consultant. Most of the time I was writing
    SQL and using Tableau. I personally don't use Tableau anymore. Since I work at
    Amazon, I use AWS QuickSight. I've gotten quite good at that. I'm sad that not
    many people use it because I would love to bounce ideas on how to design dashboards
    with them.
  sec: 3269

    whatever you use, right?
  sec: 3322

  sec: 3437
  time: '57:17'
  who: Juan Pablo

    like, you need to publish something for at least a couple of weeks. Then people
    will notice you. Then people will start liking it. The same with getting a job.

    and today.
  sec: 3475
  time: '57:55'
  who: Juan Pablo
- line: There are online conferences with networking. It's called "random date". There
    is a pool of people. The software takes a pair of people randomly and connects
    them. They can talk to each other for five minutes. If they want to continue,
    they keep talking. There's a platform "hopin" that does this. Other online conference
    platforms also have this feature. So if you attend an online conference, and the
    main thing finished, it's pretty valuable to stay a bit longer and take part in
    this networking session. You are assigned randomly to somebody, and you can talk
    to them. I met amazing people. We connected on LinkedIn afterwards. Some of them
    got invited to this podcast. That's quite useful. Do that.

    To set yourself apart, you can bring good communication: be concise and direct,
    be clear with your words, when you describe what you''re solving. The STAR format
    - Situation, Task, Action, Result - is quite useful. It summarises your project.
    It gives business context. It shows that you understand the underlying business
    or situation in your project.'

    scientists when they first start out. When they bring you on, they hire you on
    the team. You don't want files to be just on engineers' laptops. They need to
    be in a repository. It needs to be organised in such a manner that if everyone
