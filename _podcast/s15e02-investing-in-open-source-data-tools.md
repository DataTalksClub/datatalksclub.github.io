  & Monetization'
transcript:
- header: Episode Start & Welcome
- header: 'Guest Overview: Bela’s Role at a Family Office'
- line: This week we'll talk about investing, and investing specifically in open source
    tools, and in data and ML tools. We have a special guest today, Bela. Bela is
    working for a German family office that invests in VC funds and early-stage startups
    with a focus on open source data, AI, and developer tooling. In his work, he's
    sourcing, evaluating, and working with many different open source companies in
    the early stage of finding their product community fit. Actually, there is a funny
    story of how we met, because we have this thing called Open Source spotlight.
    It was a big pleasure for me to discover that people don't only use this for looking
    at tools, like developers, but sometimes investors also look at this. So this
    is how we met, and it's my pleasure to welcome you, finally. It's been a while
    since I was trying to invite you to this podcast. Welcome to our podcast!
  sec: 75
  time: '1:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, happy to be here! It's a pleasure.
  sec: 137
  time: '2:17'
  who: Bela
- line: Great. The questions for today's interview were prepared by Elena Samuylova.
    Thanks, Elena, for your help. Elena has already been a guest with us multiple
    times. She works at an open source startup. Thanks to her, we have amazing questions
    for today's interview.
  sec: 139
  time: '2:19'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Path: From Business Studies to Open Source Investing'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of open source and investing in open source,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 160
  time: '2:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, for sure. I think it's maybe a little atypical for your show, but I
    have a classical business background. Right after my studies, I started working
    in the startup and tech ecosystem. Right after my business studies, I worked at
    a company builder, which was about commercializing under-commercialized open source
    communities. And right after that, I joined TKM Family Office, where I am today.
  sec: 170
  time: '2:50'
  who: Bela
- line: Now, since pretty much two years, I'm helping to build up the investment activity.
    I started there right when the Family Office also started. As you said, correctly,
    [we're] looking for startups, talking to founders a lot, researching those topics,
    especially on the open source and developer tooling data side. That's also why
    I'm happy to be here today.
  sec: 170
  time: '2:50'
  who: Bela
- line: Yeah. Indeed, it's not a very typical background [for this podcast], which
    makes it even more interesting to have you on this show. But I'm wondering, what
    does it mean to have a business background? Or what do you actually study there?
    How to run a business or what?
  sec: 226
  time: '3:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it certainly differs from university. University, in general, it is
    about [ensuring] that you know... the most important stuff for doing what I do
    today is to understand how a company is structured, to understand how to read
    the balance sheet, to think about business models, to think about margins, marketing,
    and all this kind of stuff. So it's a very general type of study, but that's generally
    it. If you don't really know which way you want to go, it's definitely good to
    have some kind of orientation. But you can, for sure, specialize more later on
    into the studies. But I only did my Bachelor's, so I'm quite a very generalist
    type of guy, until I got into tech and startups and ventures.
  sec: 242
  time: '4:02'
  who: Bela
- line: So an MBA is also a business-related thing, but it's more like a Master's
    level education?
  sec: 303
  time: '5:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it's Master level and MBA is also for non-business Bachelor's. If you
    did, for example, an engineering major in your... I think this is also for business
    Bachelors and Undergraduates, but mainly, also for non-business undergrads to
    do an MBA. You kind of go the executive way in your organization.
  sec: 307
  time: '5:07'
  who: Bela
- header: 'Commercializing Open Source Communities: Company Builder Insights'
- line: Okay. So in your studies, you learn how to run a business, how companies structure,
    and all that. With this background, you joined a company that was interested in
    commercializing open source communities. What does that actually mean “commercializing
    open source communities”?
  sec: 337
  time: '5:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: So it was a very small company builder, run by Philip, who is also our Chief
    Investment Officer today. The thesis of a company builder in general is, “Okay,
    we have the thesis and the machinery to build up more and more early-stage startups
    and spin them out, get founders there,” and so on and so forth. The specific thesis
    there was that there is a lot of value in these communities. Back then, we have
    seen, or we thought that there might be a lot of communities that don't have any
    access to any kind of commercial version of a product. There are a lot of open
    source products with a lot of traction in the open source world, but there's no
    one to build some additional features around it, host it, package it, make it
    a great experience, and sell it.
  sec: 358
  time: '5:58'
  who: Bela
- line: It turns out that it's really cost-intensive to build a lot of startups. This
    company builder founded one startup, which is called crowd.def. I think some of
    you might have heard about it in the open source world. It's about community management
    and this kind of stuff. Jonathan, who runs it today as the CEO and founder, was
    also the second founder of the company builder. That was actually also the whole
    team of the company builder. Then, Jonathan went out and crowd full-time, Philip
    got the offer to start the Family Office, and he asked me to join. I took the
    opportunity and that's how we went there. So it was quite a short journey with
    the company builder. But really, it was my first touchpoint with open source.
    I actually haven't even really heard about it before. I just had a business background
    and I had not been in tech, really.
  sec: 358
  time: '5:58'
  who: Bela
- line: Interesting. Did I understand correctly that the [business] model for this
    company builder was to I look at [sites like] GitHub, find promising open source
    projects, and then reach out to the people that create them, asking, “Hey, do
    you want to start a company for this project?”
  sec: 489
  time: '8:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have to say that there is no blueprint on that because there was never a
    project that got so far. Crowd.dev was completely internally developed and is
    open source today. But this was kind of a thought and a strategy, but then the
    ways parted, and now we're doing what we're doing. But yeah, that's an idea that
    we had.
  sec: 506
  time: '8:26'
  who: Bela
- line: Okay. But right now you thought, “Okay, maybe instead of finding founders
    and all these people who can start a company, let's focus on companies that already
    exist and give them money.” Right?
  sec: 532
  time: '8:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: It wasn't really my decision, as you said. Philip got the offer, he asked
    me to join, and it's a great opportunity. Yeah, it is definitely easier with a
    smaller team to invest than to build your own companies. Definitely. Phillip and
    I are the only really full-time persons in the investment team. It wouldn't be
    so easy to build up [something like] one company per month with this team. But
    that's the story with that.
  sec: 548
  time: '9:08'
  who: Bela
- header: Why Venture Funding Matters for Early-Stage Startups
- line: Why are investors needed at all? Can't founders just start companies without
    your help? Why are you needed?
  sec: 584
  time: '9:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Venture capital, in specific. I think Investors are not needed for any
    type of business. I think you do not need to think that. But venture capital,
    and tech in specific, I would say, provide the money for you to build up the tech
    startups from the ground up. When you start, as a first time founder and not having
    that much money, you need to have some money to hire your first employees, to
    get your first setups, to do whatever you want to do. And to be able to do that
    and to not need to focus on profitability right away, you need some kind of investor
    to help you because they enable you to focus on growth and building instead of
    only selling and making a margin from the early days.
  sec: 595
  time: '9:55'
  who: Bela
- line: They also make it possible for founders to pay themselves a salary from the
    beginning, if you're thinking about bootstrapping something. This can be definitely
    a great thing because, I have to say, not every startup – not every tech business
    even – is a venture case. But it definitely is something where you can have a
    salary, where you can make a living from your startup from day one – at least
    from day one when you raised [funds]. That's why I would say they're needed.
  sec: 595
  time: '9:55'
  who: Bela
- line: So investors give founders money to run the company (to build a startup) and
    the alternative, as you mentioned, is bootstrapping. This is when the founders
    do not look for external investment (into external money), but they try to earn
    money themselves. They focus on profitability, and from this money, they pay themselves
    a salary and hire their first employees. But this way is not always easy, I guess,
    especially in open source. In open source, you usually do not make money directly
    from the open source [tool] from day one.
  sec: 691
  time: '11:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's slower and it also defocuses you from growing and building because
    you always have to think about, “Oh, how can I finance the next month?” and so
    on. But yeah, those are the two main ways. I mean, there are some people who already
    made some money, who can finance their own venture, but then, they're their own
    investors, I would say. Therefore, this also goes in the category of having an
    investor.
  sec: 726
  time: '12:06'
  who: Bela
- line: This means that, let's say I work at a usual full-time job, I set aside some
    money, and then use this money to just run a company. Then I don't need an investor.
  sec: 756
  time: '12:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, you have something for a start. But it really depends on what kind of
    business you want to build. It really differs. If you have a bootstrap business
    in profitability from day one – maybe it's a little bit slower, but you definitely
    know what you're doing there. With venture, you also really have to know that
    it is a little bit different. If you take money from an investor the first time,
    you definitely need to have it a second, and a third time. You have to decide
    which way you want to go, especially in the data and open source ecosystem right
    now, I would say there are so many... You really have to see where you can find
    your spot in terms of competition and positioning. It's hard to compete without
    having any money in your pockets.
  sec: 766
  time: '12:46'
  who: Bela
- header: 'Open Source as Go-to-Market: Community Trust and Distribution'
- line: It's not one of the questions we planned to ask you, but maybe you have some
    ideas about the following. Why do companies actually do business in open source?
    It's a very difficult business model, right? You open all the code from the very
    beginning and everyone can just go there, take the code and not pay you anything.
    Yet, there are startups that do that and there are investors who invest in them,
    saying, “Okay, work in the open – keep all the code open – and here's money to
    do that.” Why does such a thing even exist?
  sec: 822
  time: '13:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, there are different ways that those companies get started, right?
    There are some that are just a hobby project from some engineers. This is why
    they open source it, because it was a hobby project, and that's the way you build
    normally – in public and so on. So that's one part. And once you're open source,
    and you also have a certain size community, it's hard to take it back, so then
    you're in it. But there are also a lot of companies, especially startups, that
    plan to go the open source route because it's a way of distribution and building
    up a moat against competition in the long run.
  sec: 856
  time: '14:16'
  who: Bela
- line: It is not always the case that, even if a lot of people wouldn't consider
    that real open source, a lot of them don't have all of their code open sourced.
    They have proprietary features around it, they have proprietary versions, a lot
    of the customers they address wouldn't make the hustle to self-host it. That's
    the way. A lot of them see it as distribution channels, building a competitive
    moat through their community, selling through their community, having this kind
    of potential for early traction without revenue.
  sec: 856
  time: '14:16'
  who: Bela
- line: As a developer myself, I would add that I kind of have more trust in companies
    – in the code [if it's open source].
  sec: 936
  time: '15:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that too. Good point.
  sec: 942
  time: '15:42'
  who: Bela
- line: I just take a package from GitHub, or do something like pip install the package
    name. Then I have it, I can experiment with this, and if something's not clear,
    I could just go to GitHub and look at the code. This way, I see that, “Okay, that
    makes sense.” The entry level is nothing – I can just install it and then play
    with it. Then I have trust in this thing.
  sec: 945
  time: '15:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. This, essentially, is a part of this kind of distribution because if
    you want to go this community-driven, go-to-market, especially with a focus on
    developers, it is exactly how you said it is. They have more trust in open source.
    You can build a bottom-up community very much easier when you build it in the
    open, as opposed to when it's a closed free version.
  sec: 972
  time: '16:12'
  who: Bela
- header: 'Bottom-Up Distribution: Developer Adoption Feeding Enterprise Sales'
- line: And what does a “bottom-up community” actually mean?
  sec: 1000
  time: '16:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's from the distribution side. You could go to market bottom-up, meaning
    you start with the smaller people using your product, like the developers. And
    on the other side would be the potential to make typical “top-down enterprise
    sales,” as you would call it. So it would start at the decision makers and making
    very, very big deals there. Community building the bottom-up way that we see also
    see a lot in open source, a lot of them also do top-down sales later on. But especially
    in the beginning, we see a lot of this, “Okay, how can you find the individual
    people using your product?” And you can find developers in the open source spaces.
  sec: 1005
  time: '16:45'
  who: Bela
- line: As a developer, I do not necessarily have money to buy a tool [Bela agrees]
    but because it doesn't cost anything, I can just download and run it. Then I can
    come to my manager and say, “Look, there is this awesome tool. What about self-costing
    it?” And then my manager would say, “Yeah, I will talk to my manager about that.”
    The manager of my manager actually has the money and has the budget and then they
    say “Okay, it looks like a useful tool. Here's the money.”
  sec: 1052
  time: '17:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's a little bit of the evolution of the product-led sales that [companies
    like] Slack and Notion did. Some people used it, some people used it, and then
    you come in like, “Oh, now I have to pay.” But now 50 people are already using
    it as their main note-taking tool – now we really have to pay for it. It's the
    evolution in the developer space for the same kind of playbook.
  sec: 1081
  time: '18:01'
  who: Bela
- header: 'Investment Focus: Early-Stage B2B Developer, Data & AI Tooling'
- line: When preparing for this podcast episode, I learned a new word –“thesis”. Well,
    I did know this word, but in a different context. For me, it was something like
    a Master's thesis – the thing I wrote at university. But here, you already mentioned
    the word thesis for your company builder. The thesis was that you find founders
    and let them run a company. Then there is also a thing called an “investment thesis”.
    I guess this is for investors – what they invest in (which companies). So what
    I wanted to ask is, what is your investment thesis? Where do you invest, in which
    companies, at which stage?
  sec: 1113
  time: '18:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. We definitely, as I think already mentioned, do early stage. We consider
    [companies] as early as possible – not really later than the Seed round. In venture
    language, you have the first round, which is sometimes called an Angel round,
    sometimes a Pre-seed round – it depends. You can always frame it however you want.
    Sometimes you also reframe it in the future. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1154
  time: '19:14'
  who: Bela
- header: 'Funding Stage Primer: Angels, Pre-Seed, and Seed Explained'
- line: Before we go to other rounds, what does it actually mean to have an “angel
    round” or “pre-seed round”? Why “angel”?
  sec: 1187
  time: '19:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's very blurry. You can actually call everything anything, I think.
    I've seen a lot of different words for a lot of the same stuff. But I think essentially,
    “angels” are non-institutional investors. What institutional investors are, we
    will, I think, come to that later. There are venture capital funds, also corporate
    venture capital investors.
  sec: 1193
  time: '19:53'
  who: Bela
- line: Basically a company with money.
  sec: 1224
  time: '20:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah. Angel rounds are pretty much only for individual investors, which
    include business angels and also family offices. Pre-seed rounds could be in the
    same size, but there are dedicated pre-seed venture capital funds as well. They
    also sometimes invest in Angel rounds, so the wording is not quite clear, I think.
  sec: 1226
  time: '20:26'
  who: Bela
- line: When you already have an idea as a founder, or a potential founder, and then
    maybe you have some code, maybe you already have some GitHub repo. You see, “Okay,
    this is promising. Here's a bunch of money.” That's the Angel round or Pre-seed
    round?
  sec: 1251
  time: '20:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, you can do it however you want. It also sometimes depends on the
    size. We have seen the French guys for Mistral raising over 100 million in a seed
    round as their first round, which some people would call a pre-seed round even.
    And 100 million is sometimes [called] a Series C – so there really are no rules
    for that. But I would definitely say that it's better to start with the smallest
    name possible. Always consider raising a Pre-seed instead of a Seed if you've
    not raised before, because it gives you an opportunity for the Seed round to also
    raise without revenue and so on. You will not really be able to raise a Series
    A without certain metrics, but you would with a Seed sometimes. But the names
    are really blurry, and you can call anything everything. There are no rules, I
    would say. But you would normally start with a Pre-seed then go to Seed, and then
    the Series A, B, C, D, and so on come after. This is the normal way of how it
    progresses.
  sec: 1267
  time: '21:07'
  who: Bela
- header: 'Fundraising Strategy: 12–18 Month Runway & Use of Proceeds'
- line: Typically, a company, or a founder, says, “Hey, this is what I have. Give
    me some money.” They put in an open call, or maybe they reach out to different
    investors, and then the investors think, “Okay, this is promising. Here's some
    money.” Right? And they do this multiple times.
  sec: 1340
  time: '22:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. In the best case, as a founder, you should think about what kind of money
    you need for the next 12 to 18 months, for example. It depends. Say I want to
    hire two-three developers – I want to hire whatever. I need this amount of money
    for that. I want to do some marketing experiments. I need some money for that.
    In total, I need x, y, z type of money. And then I go out with this. Because all
    the investors are gonna ask you, “What do you need that money for?” And if you
    don't have a good answer to that, that's not a good sign – if you don't know what
    you're raising for. Then the investors have their own processes. Normally, if
    you have a venture fund, with the money from one fund, you typically invest into
    20--40 startups. It always depends on the round you're investing in. But in the
    early stage, I would say, most of them invest in like 20 to 30 to 40 different
    companies.
  sec: 1356
  time: '22:36'
  who: Bela
- header: 'Geographic & Sector Focus: Europe and Developer Stack Niches'
- line: Okay. So you focus on Angel rounds, Pre-seed rounds, and Seed rounds – the
    early stage, when companies do not have much in terms of money (in terms of investment)
    yet. And you focus on open source. Right?
  sec: 1422
  time: '23:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Our general focus is everything that is B2B software, but our niche is
    developer stack (developer tooling) and a lot of this is open source because open
    source is a great go-to-market model for those kinds of companies. But not everything
    we do is open source and not everything we do is even developer tooling. Most
    of it is. As you said, we're doing Pre-seed/Seed rounds, mainly in Europe. We
    would also do [other places] but mainly in Europe. We really like, as I said in
    this niche, founders and companies with a strong focus on community-driven go-to-markets,
    as for example, open source. This includes... We did stuff in AI infrastructure,
    in cybersecurity and cloud, in data streaming. But we also did, to mention here
    – maybe it’s not interesting for everyone watching this – but we also did investments
    in other areas of b2b software, like intralogistics, data privacy, robotics, and
    so on and so forth. The main focus, I would say, 80% of what we do nowadays, is
    in this niche.
  sec: 1439
  time: '23:59'
  who: Bela
- header: 'Investor Types Compared: Angels, VCs, and Family Offices'
- line: We already talked about Angels – they are individuals who have some money
    and they invest. Maybe not a lot of money, but they have some money that they
    say, “Okay, this startup's promising. Here's a small investment.” There are also
    VC funds, which are larger organizations with more money. They typically invest
    (give more money) to companies. And there are also family funds (family offices).
    This is where you work, right? What is the difference? Or what does it actually
    mean to have a family office? What is a family office? And what's the difference
    between Angels and VC funds?
  sec: 1519
  time: '25:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Maybe I'll start with the [VC] funds, because that's the most prominent,
    I would say, type of investor that you also see in the news and so on. In the
    end, I would say they are like money managers. They raise capital from outside
    investors, like big pension funds. In the US, they also [get capital] from university
    funds, government programs in Europe and Germany. Also, there are individual corporate
    investors – individual investors could be Angels, or it could be family offices.
    Corporate investors could be classic corporations, big companies, who have a financial
    interest in working with their money. So they raise funds from these kinds of
    people and organizations. They have a certain amount of time, and they try to
    maximize what they can give back to them. That's the model of a VC fund.
  sec: 1560
  time: '26:00'
  who: Bela
- line: Then you have the ones who work with their own money, which are business Angels
    and family offices, for example. I would also say that there, the line is a little
    bit blurry. I think historically, family offices are more connected to businesses.
    But nowadays, family office also just means that you, as an Angel, invest a little
    bit more and a little bit more professionally. An Angel and a family office doesn't
    really have to be a lot different. There are, for sure, also family offices that
    are quite closely connected to an operational business because they then also
    invest with not only financial interest, but also they want to have some overlap
    with the operation of the business. But we, for example, don't have any operational
    business, we are pretty much a VC fund, but only with our own money that we have
    in the company. I don't know if this answers your question.
  sec: 1560
  time: '26:00'
  who: Bela
- line: More or less, but maybe let me try to summarize what I understood. Business
    Angels, or Angel investors, are people with their own money, and they manage this
    money themselves. For example, I have a bunch of money, I see a promising startup
    that is trying to raising funds (they need some money) and I say, “Okay, here's
    $10,000 (or whatever).” Then they respond with, “Oh, thank you. With this money,
    we can pay our developer for one month (or whatever).” [chuckles] So these are
    Angel investors. From what I know, they typically don't give a ton of money to
    startups.
  sec: 1685
  time: '28:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Then there are, from what I understood, family offices. Here, the difference
    between a business Angel and a family office is that the person with the money
    hires somebody to make these investments. They don't do these calculations themselves
    or think about, “Should I invest there or not?” Instead, they hire somebody like
    you, for example, who does that. Right? That's the main difference?
  sec: 1685
  time: '28:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. As I said, there are also some Angels who work with employees. It also
    may be different in terms of how you market it, because all the Angels are also
    working like entities for their investments. Most of the time, they're not investing
    as a private person. But yeah, that's pretty much it. It's a little bit blurry.
    I would say family offices are a little bit more of a professional setup. But
    family offices also, in the past, did a lot of other things than venture capitals.
    We are focusing on venture capital – a lot of family offices are also more like
    general money managers – doing a lot of real estate, doing public equities, doing
    private equity, in more senior companies. It is quite blurry. I would say that
    in general, family offices make a little bit larger checks. And you really have
    to differentiate between family offices who have an operational business behind
    it and industry specifics, and the ones who operate like a venture capital investor,
    like we do.
  sec: 1756
  time: '29:16'
  who: Bela
- header: 'Check Sizes & Stage Variability: No One-Size-Fits-All'
- line: I was going to ask you about these checks. You mentioned that family offices
    typically give larger checks. I know a few people who do angel Investing, and
    from what they told me, the investments they make are not large – it can be 10,000,
    it can be 20,000. But for a startup, just this investment alone does not make
    much difference. But when they have like 10-20 Angel investors, and each of them
    gives 10-20K, then they have some money for some time. Meanwhile, a family office
    can give a larger check than that because they have more money, I guess, than
    an individual who can invest in a startup. Right?
  sec: 1828
  time: '30:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I would say that business Angels are also typically more focused on
    early stage [startups] and there are also a lot of family offices that do later
    rounds. So the check sizes that family offices write are, I think, pretty much
    uncapped. There are ones doing serious, A Series, B Series investments – there
    are ones like us who are doing early stage investments – but, yeah, that's pretty
    much it. There are also angels who write 100K checks, so it really differs. It's
    not hard to really... I'm sorry to say this to a lot of questions today, but there's
    no rule for that.
  sec: 1873

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, as long as you do good work and do your stuff, people won't really care
    if you're calling yourself an Angel investor or if you call it a family office
    – whatever. I think it doesn't really make a big difference.

- line: When you invest in open source companies, what do you actually look at? What
    are the criteria you use to make a decision whether you want to give them money
    or not, and how much you want to give them?
  sec: 1951
  time: '32:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: How much is a question that is more related to how much they're raising, and
    our typical ticket sizes. If you have a fund – if you want to invest in 20-30
    (whatever number of) companies, then you need a typical ticket size that you write,
    or at least the typical amount of shares that you want to own after you invest.
    It's not like I'm a little bit more committed to this company, so I invest more
    in this and I think that they're cool, but not so cool, so I invest a little bit
    less. I think that it doesn't work this way. You really have to be fully committed
    in every startup that you invest in. In the end, there is some amount of finance
    in there, so you really have to make the calculations whether this works, so there's
    this amount. That's where the amount of money comes from.
  sec: 1966
  time: '32:46'
  who: Bela
- line: But in terms of which company you invest in, I would say it also differs a
    lot from case to case. For sure, in the open source world, for example, there's
    no minimum amount of stars that you need. We also see a lot of investments that
    are made pre-launch. They call themselves an open source, because they want to
    be open source – they want to see it as their go-to-market – but they're not even
    launched. There's no metrics on the open source side. So I would say that stars
    are a great discovery metric – for example, for me to discover projects – because
    it's hard to discover something if it's just a private GitHub repo. That's quite
    hard. But you can really tell that a startup that has twice as many GitHub stars
    can raise twice as much money. It really has to stay with, “Okay, the team must
    have an understanding of the value of the community. They must at least have a
    plan on how to grow it, and how to capture the created value in the future.”
  sec: 1966
  time: '32:46'
  who: Bela
- line: I think this is a very important part for investors to understand – if they
    think that this team knows how to close this kind of gap that you sometimes have
    in open source between value creation and value capturing. So I would say that
    there is no magic recipe. As an investor, you definitely have to go deep into
    this kind of thing like, “How do they think about their commercialization?” And
    this kind of stuff. “Do they have an idea about it? Or do you yourself have an
    idea about it?” You don't really have to have everything figured out, but you
    have to think about whether you can make money out of this product. Besides that,
    I would say that the most important criteria are the same as a non-open source
    company. You look at the team, you look at the need in the market, how big the
    problem is, and so on, and so forth.
  sec: 1966
  time: '32:46'
  who: Bela
- line: Especially in Pre-seed and Seed rounds, the team is a very big factor, because
    the product can also change a lot, market conditions can change a lot. Also, for
    the founders, I really have to say that picking the right investors from a human
    kind of way is very important, because you're working together for 10 years, minimum
    (most of the time). So that is really important. I would say, those commercialization
    ideas, and so on, are a little bit different for open source. You have to think
    about them as an investor. But most criteria are the same as in non-open source
    startups.
  sec: 1966

  who: Bela

  sec: 2187
  time: '36:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: There is no product market fit, most of the time, if you're a Pre-seed or
    Seed. You have a product market fit when you have a lot of traction, and people
    are just ripping your product out of your hands. But you have to understand if
    there's a potential... Is there really a problem? Are you solving a problem or
    are you just building anything to build a solution? And you are just looking for
    a problem somewhere [that may not exist]?
  sec: 2197

    be product market fit.”
  sec: 2222

- line: It really depends on how professional you are, but we talk with the founders
    multiple times before we invest. We have several calls with them, do interviews
    with potential and also current users, and talk with other investors about it.
    I mean, there are certainly some Angels who just see a pitch deck and put money
    on it. But we certainly talk to the founders, 2, 3, 4, 5 (depends) times. It's
    definitely a very important factor to get to know them – to get to know how they
    think.
  sec: 2246
  time: '37:26'
  who: Bela
- line: Okay, this is the kind of feed between you and founders, then you also look
    at the team, you look at the problem size and then when it specifically comes
    to open source, you look if the team has an understanding of how the community
    is going to develop and how large it is. You look at how they are going to capture
    the value they create. It isn't just the product that people will use, that there
    is potential for making money out of that product.

    metric, but you still look at this sometimes because it gives you an idea of how
    discoverable [the product] is. At the end, you do look, but, maybe the important
    part for you is not the amount of stars, but if there are any stars at all. Is
    that right?
  sec: 2341
  time: '39:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, what I said was more about if there are no stars, and it's a private repo,
    I cannot find it, so I cannot invest at all. It's more like stars are a great
    discovery metric for me to discover projects myself. But you really also have
    to set this in perspective with the project they're working on. For example, if
    you're working on something in the generative AI space within the last months,
    you would have a good chance to have a lot of stars of people just being curious
    and putting a star there as a bookmark – and that's it. If you have a project
    and have 5000 stars but no active people, it's not worth anything.
  sec: 2368
  time: '39:28'
  who: Bela
- line: If you have 100 stars, but 20 people actively engaging on your Discord every
    day, I would say that this could be more valuable as an early stage company. So
    yeah, the stars are a metric – you have to set them in perspective. It can show
    how people adopt your product, but it cannot show everything. It's often a kind
    of vanity metric as well.
  sec: 2368
  time: '39:28'
  who: Bela
- line: But having a good number of stars is actually a good thing. I know that when
    you have many stars in one day, then you get into the GitHub's Trending page.
    This is how your project can be found by other people. Is this how you discover
    projects yourself? Do you go to GitHub Trending and look at the projects there?
  sec: 2441
  time: '40:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: The problem there is that those projects are also most of the time too late
    for us as an investment. That's another thing – if they have 5000 stars, for example,
    and more, and they have a great team, and they have a great idea of how to commercialize
    it, and it's a big problem – most of the time, they already have an investment,
    because it is quite transparent. It is great to discover the projects that are
    still smaller, but have an engaging community – that have this spike in stars
    after you invested. It's better than before you invested. Right? It also depends
    on the case and who you're building for but, in general, stars are good and bad.
    You can track it, you can look at it, but it shouldn't be like, “Oh, I invest
    in only above 2000 stars and with this kind of star growth rate.”

  who: Alexey
- line: Networking is a large part of venture capital in general – knowing people
    who know people who know people. But for us, it's also more and more about looking
    and screening GitHub – I have my search queries where I look for startups. A lot
    of VCs also do data-driven sourcing where they have automated... I think it's
    clear what data-driven sourcing means. Then it's also inbound, right? People who
    are getting in contact with you, who are texting you, “Hey, I'm building this
    and that.” I think inbound/outbound are the other two most important [things].
  sec: 2546
  time: '42:26'
  who: Bela
- line: And then you have a network, which is also kind of an inbound channel, but
    more qualified and a little bit less [broad] – the people know you, they know
    what you're looking at. Those, I think, are most important. For sure, you look
    at [things like] GitHub, for example, Product Hunt, different other newsletters
    that send out tools that are in beta. You're also at conferences, you're talking
    with accelerators – a lot of different ways. There's also no recipe there. I would
    say that there is a lot of stuff coming from your network, but you cannot rely
    on that, so a lot of people build up other ways to find cool stuff in the market.

    I have on my desk, whether I work closely with some of our portfolio companies,
    or working on some internal projects, or I'm really digging deep into one or two
    startups that we're looking at right now. Then I don't have that much time, but
    I try to allocate a minimum of two hours in the morning, normally, to sourcing.
    We have quite a narrow scope with this niche, so it's quite easy to have a good
    overview there. For sure, it's not everything, especially the pre-launch stuff
    that is made by people who are just thinking about leaving their big tech company
    and know some VC investors from their lunch break and then just make the deal
    before it's public. Therefore, you need a network for those people. But for outbound
    sourcing, I try to allocate some hours every morning to stay on top of that.
  sec: 2658

    to [the people who run the project].

  sec: 2733

    For example, by watching this interview, they say, “Okay, I want to write to this
    person and pitch my product/my idea.”
  sec: 2737
  time: '45:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, or, for example, if I know someone who's getting in touch with someone
    else – investors are not only investing alone. We also co-invest with a lot of
    bigger funds and smaller funds and Angels. So if they see something cool that
    we would fit with, they also say, “Hey, have you seen this? Do you want me to
    connect you to them?” Those are the ways that we get in contact with cool stuff.

  sec: 2783
  time: '46:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, the bare minimum would be to look at what we are doing. If you're
    building something in this vertical, especially in the developer stack – B2B software
    in general, but especially the developer stack – I'm happy to have any kind of
    request. You can just say, “Hey, I saw you there. I just discovered you. I heard
    from you about whatever. I'm building in this and that space. Do you want to talk?
    Here's my calendar.” Whatever. It doesn't need to be this huge amount [of text]
    because we only look at [things] in our niche. There are not 200 people a day
    outreaching to me. Or if they don't even look at what I'm interested in, for example,
    I would say it's a no-go.
  sec: 2802
  time: '46:42'
  who: Bela

    what kind of deals they're normally doing and if you fit that and not just spamming
    all people you find on LinkedIn that have “investor” somewhere in their profile.
    Look at them and maybe also write one line about why you two could match together,
    “I saw that you focus on this and that, and I saw that you invest in XYZ. That
    fits perfectly because I'm building whatever.” Then I'm always happy to talk with
    everyone because it's always great to have an exchange even if it doesn't lead
    to an investment in the end. But yes, I'm happy for everyone who's building in

    question is, “We are building a conversational data tool. Some parts will be open
    source, while some other parts will remain closed source. Would you consider this
    model?”
  sec: 2968
  time: '49:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, definitely. This open-core, I would call it, startup model is something
    that is really familiar. A lot of people work with this. For me, like I'm not
    the religious open source guy, I have to say. For me, it's not about that you
    have to have everything open source MIT license and don't make money out of it.
    It's great that you have an idea of, “I put this and that in open source, and
    it helps me with this and that.” So if you have reasoning behind it, and if you
    also have reasoning behind doing something not open source – that's amazing. If
    you're building something totally proprietary, and you have very good reasoning
    for it, that's also fine. If you think about what you're doing and if you have
    good reasoning behind it, you can do open-core, you can have full open source
    and only sell enterprise licenses – you can do whatever you want, if you reason
    it in a good way, I would say. Definitely, I think commercial open source and
    this kind of open core model, where you have proprietary features, and a hosted
    version of that, also I would say the most is the prominent model that I see with
    newer and younger open source startups.
  sec: 2986

    closed, and they offer something like a “cloud version” of the tool – a hosted
    version. You don't have to host this thing yourself. What are the other models
    of monetizing/commercializing an open source project in addition to open core?
  sec: 3069
  time: '51:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. One of the most classic ways would be to just sell enterprise licenses,
    right? There's also “on-premise” licenses. It depends on what license you have
    to determine whether you are able to really host it yourself. But the hosted versions
    are really the number one [way in terms of popularity], I would say. There, you
    have the difference between the ones who have proprietary features versus the
    ones who just have a better user experience and do not have the hassle with the
    data, and so on and so forth. You don't need some DevOps – you don't need anyone
    to configure it. This would be just hosted open source. But then you really have
    to look at the license because you don't want any big cloud providers to just
    host it and make money out of what you build.
  sec: 3090
  time: '51:30'
  who: Bela
- line: You should think about the license twice. Selling enterprise on-premise licenses
    is possible. In general, on-prem license, also with proprietary features – you
    can mix these different licenses, different features – you can mix and match that
    as you want. You really have to think about who your users are, what problem you
    are solving for them, and what kind of business model or what kind of service
    they want. If you're really in a really regulated industry, selling to fintechs
    or financial industry players, handling a lot of data, maybe it's better for you
    to work with a proprietary enterprise license or an enterprise license, if your
    open source version with additional features or without or with support. This
    is not really the most liked model for investors, because it's not that scalable.
    There are a lot of different ways – you just have to find the best way for your
    customers and your financial interest.
  sec: 3090
  time: '51:30'
  who: Bela

    is that I, as an individual, can use this software for free, but if I want to
    use it for a commercial activity – for activity that generates some money, let's
    say at work – then I have to pay.
  sec: 3214

- line: So as I said, this is maybe great for bootstrapping, but I would say this
    is not really liked by investors because it's not scalable. You always have to
    think about... if you want to go the investment route, you have to figure out
    an investment model that is scalable – one where you don't need one more employee
    for more revenue, but you can scale the revenue without scaling up your employees
    at some point for the same amount. This kind of leverage in the long term – I
    think a lot of investors want to see that.
  sec: 3287
  time: '54:47'
  who: Bela
- line: Okay. So if you want to bootstrap, then fine. But if you want to look for
    investments, you should probably think of other ways of commercializing your products,
    right?

    it become more popular or less popular? What's your opinion on that?”
  sec: 3333
  time: '55:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think we are just at the start of... I also have the feeling that there
    are more and more and more open source players, and also some doing the same [thing]
    but if you look at the proprietary startup ecosystem, you see 10–20 companies
    doing exactly the same boring stuff. I'm sorry to say it that way. [chuckles]
    We are not there – not near there. There are only a few niche applications where
    open source is the status quo and I think there is a possibility that we can get
    there, where open source players will be the dominant players in a lot of those
    markets – not only the challengers, but the ones who are dominating [these spaces].
  sec: 3344
  time: '55:44'
  who: Bela
- line: I think we have to work on a lot of things to get there. But you've seen where
    we are today with databases – with a lot of open source databases. I mean, in
    the end, they're hosted a lot of times by the big cloud providers. But I think
    there is a chance that open source will go further, and we will see some big market
    leaders there. I don't really think that we have them yet. I look at a lot of
    open source, so I also have the feeling that there is already a lot. But if you
    then look into other areas, you will see that it's still small.

- header: 'Recent Open Source Successes: Hugging Face, Supabase, Kong, Qdrant'
- line: Do you know any more or less recent success stories of companies doing open
    source? Of course, there is Linux, Red Hat – companies like that, which have been
    around for a very long time. I know MySQL, Oracle, and Java have been around for
    years. I also know, personally, Elasticsearch, even despite the difficulties with
    AWS – they had a problem with AWS hosting Elasticsearch and not paying anything.
    It's still, I think, kind of a success story because they are a successful startup
    – they do make money. But it's also a relatively old company. Do you know any
    recent successful open source companies?
  sec: 3446
  time: '57:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say that for [companies like Elasticsearch] it can only be said if
    they're successful after a few more years. Even ones like Mongo, like Elastic,
    like HashiCorp – right now they're all on the public markets, they're all stock-listed,
    and they're still fighting with the capital markets about their profitability.
    So what is their success? It's always hard to tell. But for sure, there are some
    promising companies that closed larger funding rounds in the recent past. So far
    you see this as a success – it is at least a sign of success. There are ones such
    as, for example, Superbase, which is building a platform as a service. Hugging
    Face, for sure. Kong, the API management platform. Apollo, the GraphQL platform.
    I think they've raised big rounds.
  sec: 3496
  time: '58:16'
  who: Bela
- line: I cannot tell if they're really going to be multi-billion dollar companies,
    but we see signs that there are a couple who could be the next Mongo, the next
    Elastic, the next HashiCorp. There are also some small projects in Germany, where
    we are both located, which are a little earlier, but still very promising. You
    see Gitpod, which has quite good traction. In the vector space, you see Qdrant,
    you see Deepset – they are not the biggest projects yet, but [a part of] a great
    wave of open source companies from Germany and from Europe. It's not the amount
    of funding that companies like Superbase have, but we see the different stages
    of those companies that are getting filled.

- line: Last question for you – we should be wrapping up. The question is, “Do you
    know any good book or other resource that you can recommend to the listeners or
    somebody who wants to learn more about investing and about things that we talked
    about today?”
  sec: 3618
  time: '1:00:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. It depends. On investing, I would say, in the community-building kind
    of way... in this open source community building, there's an article (I can later
    send you some documents about it) which is from Crowd.dev, actually, about their
    top six books on developed community building. I think this is really important
    for early stage founders that are building open source to understand. This is
    not the investment part. There's also a great article from Bessemer Ventures –
    it's a big VC fund. It's already from 2020, but it's about open source metrics
    in investing. I think this could be interesting. Books about investing in general?
    I can maybe send you something afterwards. I would say that despite everything
    that he is doing personally, Zero to One from Peter Thiel is a good book to start
    with startups.

    and has the Founders Fund and he's an investor. He's quite, I would say, a difficult
    person in terms of his political thoughts. But despite that, the book Zero to
    One is recommendable.

intro: How do you build a sustainable business around open source developer, data
  and AI tooling — and what does it take to fund, commercialize and scale it? In this
  episode Bela Wiertz, who works at a German family office investing in VC funds and
  early-stage startups with a focus on open-source Data, AI & Developer Tooling, walks
  through the practical playbook for founders and investors. Drawing on hands-on sourcing
  and evaluation of early-stage open-source companies, Bela covers go-to-market strategies
  that leverage community trust and bottom-up developer adoption, the role of venture
  funding for angels, pre-seed and seed rounds, and fundraising hygiene like a 12–18
  month runway. We dig into open-core and licensing trade-offs, monetization models
  (hosted services, enterprise licenses, support), limits to support-led revenue,
  and how to read community metrics — GitHub stars versus active engagement. Bela
  also explains sourcing and due diligence techniques (GitHub screening, user interviews,
  co-investor checks), geographic and sector focus in Europe, and real-world examples
  like Hugging Face, Supabase, Kong and Qdrant. Listen to gain actionable frameworks
  for GTM, funding strategy, monetization and early-stage investment signals for open
  source developer, data and AI tooling.
