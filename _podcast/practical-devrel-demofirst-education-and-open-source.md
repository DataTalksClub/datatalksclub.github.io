description: Master developer advocacy, open source mentorship & demo-driven communication
  to elevate technical leadership, amplify community impact & accelerate adoption.
intro: How do developer advocates create measurable community impact while balancing
  technical leadership, mentorship, and clear communication? In this episode Will
  Russell, Developer Advocate at Kestra, explores that question through the lens of
  workflow orchestration and developer education. Will is known for his technical
  video content on workflow orchestration and for building open source education programs
  that help new contributors make their first pull requests. <br><br> We cover core
  topics including technical leadership in community settings, practical approaches
  to open source mentorship, and the power of demo-driven communication and documentation
  to make complex tools approachable. Will discusses how creating targeted videos
  and clear docs lowers barriers for developers and nurtures sustainable contributor
  pipelines. <br><br> Listeners will come away with concrete ideas for designing open
  source education programs, using demos to explain concepts, and applying developer
  advocacy techniques to grow healthier communities. This episode is useful for developer
  advocates, engineering managers, open source maintainers, and anyone interested
  in workflow orchestration, developer education, and community-driven technical leadership.

transcript:
- header: Episode Opening & Guest Overview
- line: This week we’ll discuss many topics—developer advocacy, organizing hackathons,
    and Will’s career journey.
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m going off script because we have a special guest, Will, whose career we
    will explore today.
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: If you took our recent data engineering course, you probably know Will, a
    developer advocate at Kestra, a workflow orchestration platform. Will led module
    two on workflow orchestration.
  sec: 0
  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: Previously, Will built open source education programs to help developers make
    their first contributions to open source. He creates technical videos and documentation.
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Today, we’ll talk about his work. Welcome, Will, it’s a pleasure to have you.
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you for having me. I’m excited to dive into what you just discussed.
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Will
- line: The questions for today’s interview were prepared by Johanna Byer—thank you,
    Johanna, for your help.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: I want to go off script a bit at the start.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: We always ask about the career journey, but I really like your videos.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: During the data engineering course office hours, if you haven’t checked the
    course yet, you still can—even though it’s finishing, module two about Kestra
    is available.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Video Production Setup: Camera, Lens & Webcam Workflow'
- line: I really like the quality of your picture and all the little things in your
    background, the microphone, and the headset.
  sec: 201
  time: '3:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Tell us about your setup. How did you achieve such good picture quality?
  sec: 201
  time: '3:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: My setup has evolved slowly over the years, especially since COVID when everything
    went online and people started making nice setups. I thought that was cool.
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Will
- line: We’ll talk more about how I’ve been making videos in different forms for a
    few years.
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Will
- line: I decided to learn photography and got a Sony mirrorless camera with an HDMI
    output.
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Will
- line: I use a simple prime lens, which gives a nice blurry background. The camera
    is plugged into my laptop and appears as a webcam, making it simple.
  sec: 249
  time: '4:09'
  who: Will
- line: What makes video look good is not the camera, but the lighting.
  sec: 249
  time: '4:09'
  who: Will
- line: I have a nice light off to the side, which lights me up, and some lights behind
    me to separate me from the background.
  sec: 249
  time: '4:09'
  who: Will
- line: Because the background is at a 45-degree angle, it creates depth and makes
    it feel more professional. In reality, the camera is clamped to the back of my
    monitor, so if I shake my desk, the camera shakes too.
  sec: 274
  time: '4:34'
  who: Will
- line: The key is to make recording videos for Kestra as frictionless as possible—just
    turn the light and camera on, and I’m ready.
  sec: 274
  time: '4:34'
  who: Will
- line: The camera is right above my monitor, so when I do demos, it’s easy to look
    up at the camera and down at my work. There’s nothing in the way.
  sec: 300
  time: '5:00'
  who: Will
- line: I used to put the camera on a tripod in front of my monitor, but then I couldn’t
    see the demo, so I was always leaning around the camera—that was awful. This setup
    is simple but effective.
  sec: 300
  time: '5:00'
  who: Will
- line: Your voice comes through clearly. What microphone do you use?
  sec: 337
  time: '5:37'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Audio Setup: Microphone, Preamp & Pop Filtering'
- line: I have a Rode XLR microphone plugged into a preamp, which connects to my computer.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Will
- line: It requires a lot of power, so the closer it is to my mouth, the more radio-style
    it sounds.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Will
- line: I used to keep the microphone out of the shot, but then I lost clarity—people
    like the clarity of my voice, so I keep it closer now.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Will
- line: The big sock helps with pops and crackles, which is not nice for anyone’s
    ears.
  sec: 361
  time: '6:01'
  who: Will
- line: This keeps everything looking and sounding clean.
  sec: 361
  time: '6:01'
  who: Will
- line: The hardest thing for me is the lighting.
  sec: 391
  time: '6:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Did you experiment to achieve your current setup, or did you learn something
    specific?
  sec: 391
  time: '6:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did you position the lights?
  sec: 391
  time: '6:31'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Lighting Strategy: 45° Key Light & Background Separation'
- line: Since COVID, I’ve lived in a few different places with the same desk but different
    setups.
  sec: 415
  time: '6:55'
  who: Will
- line: Normally, people think to put the light directly behind the camera or use
    a ring light, but that loses depth in your face.
  sec: 415
  time: '6:55'
  who: Will
- line: I learned from photography that having the light at a 45-degree angle creates
    nice contours and shadows, adding depth.
  sec: 415
  time: '6:55'
  who: Will
- line: My desk has a spot right next to where my microphone is clamped, next to my
    monitor.
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Will
- line: It’s cramped, but it works.
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Will
- line: I’ve moved the light left and right, and this position lights me up without
    washing me out.
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Will
- line: I have a window next to the light, and I used to use natural light, but it’s
    not reliable, especially in winter when it gets dark at 3 p.m.
  sec: 464
  time: '7:44'
  who: Will
- line: Now I close the blind and use artificial light, so I can record at any time
    of day.
  sec: 464
  time: '7:44'
  who: Will
- line: In London, you probably have even less light than we do in Berlin.
  sec: 482
  time: '8:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. If I open the blind, it lights the background more but puts me in
    shadow.
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Will
- line: It’s important to use artificial light so you know what you’ll get from your
    video every time.
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Will
- line: There’s nothing worse than one video looking great because the natural light
    was perfect, and another looking dark because the sun set.
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Will
- line: This setup is the most reliable. I’ve had this equipment for a few years,
    and it works well.
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Will
- line: I could add another light, but I like the simplicity.
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Will
- line: If people think it looks good, I don’t see a reason to change it.
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Will
- line: Your hobby in photography helped you set up the lights and everything.
  sec: 542
  time: '9:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I used to think photography was about buying a lens with a wide aperture
    for a blurry background.
  sec: 547
  time: '9:07'
  who: Will
- line: I learned quickly that lighting is the main thing—the blurry background is
    nice, but lighting makes it look good.
  sec: 547
  time: '9:07'
  who: Will
- line: I didn’t have a light for a while, and the videos looked better with one.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Will
- line: A lot of people could get away with just a webcam and a light, and the quality
    would improve.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Will
- line: It’s not all about the camera—the camera helps, but once you pump it through
    Zoom, you probably won’t notice much difference over a decent webcam.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Will
- line: Not mine, but Macs usually have good webcams. My Windows laptop is powerful,
    but the camera is not great. Anyway, most laptops, especially Macs, do have good
    cameras.
  sec: 588
  time: '9:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: We got off script—amazing setup, thanks for telling us.
  sec: 615
  time: '10:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m tempted to ask about the Lego in your background, but we don’t have time
    for that.
  sec: 615
  time: '10:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you’re listening to the podcast and don’t see the video, check YouTube
    to see why I asked Will about his setup—it looks very professional.
  sec: 615
  time: '10:15'
  who: Alexey
- header: Early Career & Hackathon Discovery
- line: Back to the podcast. The usual question I always ask at the beginning is for
    the guest to tell us about their career journey.
  sec: 641
  time: '10:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did you start? What did you do to get to where you are now?
  sec: 641
  time: '10:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: It all started just before 2018, when I was deciding what to study at university.
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Will
- line: I had done some programming, but I wasn’t completely sure I wanted to make
    it my career.
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Will
- line: Engineering was also appealing, so I was weighing my options between the two.
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Will
- line: I got really into programming during a school module and decided that computer
    science sounded interesting.
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Will
- line: So, I chose to study computer science at university.
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Will
- line: I thought I would find my niche and become a software developer, like most
    people who take that path.
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Will
- header: 'Hackathons as Learning: Git, Teamwork & Building Projects'
- line: What changed things was getting involved with hackathons.
  sec: 706
  time: '11:46'
  who: Will
- line: I hadn’t really heard much about them before, but I really enjoyed them and
    ended up going to five in my first year.
  sec: 706
  time: '11:46'
  who: Will
- line: Later, I got involved in organizing hackathons in my second and third years.
  sec: 706
  time: '11:46'
  who: Will
- line: From there, I joined organizations that helped run hackathons.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Will
- line: During COVID, these organizations started building programs to help students
    contribute to open source, since many lost their internships.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Will
- line: This allowed students to gain valuable experience by contributing to large
    open source projects.
  sec: 724
  time: '12:04'
  who: Will
- header: 'Open Source Education Programs: Path from Contract to Full-Time'
- line: What started as a 12-week summer contract turned into part-time work while
    I finished my degree, then into a full-time job for about three years.
  sec: 736
  time: '12:16'
  who: Will
- line: This was not what I expected when I started university—I thought I’d be a
    programmer, but I ended up in a different, though still technical, role.
  sec: 736
  time: '12:16'
  who: Will
- line: After several years running open source programs, I still had the urge to
    move into a more technical role.
  sec: 762
  time: '12:42'
  who: Will
- line: My work was focused on helping others do technical things and teaching entry-level
    skills.
  sec: 762
  time: '12:42'
  who: Will
- line: The idea of developer advocacy came up often, and I met people in that field
    through hackathons.
  sec: 762
  time: '12:42'
  who: Will
- line: I started looking into developer advocacy and asked people I met for advice
    on how to transition.
  sec: 794
  time: '13:14'
  who: Will
- line: That’s when I connected with Kestra—Anna, our product lead, and I met on LinkedIn.
  sec: 794
  time: '13:14'
  who: Will
- line: We had a chat, and I learned more about Kestra and what it does.
  sec: 794
  time: '13:14'
  who: Will
- line: Part of the reason for hiring a developer advocate was to clarify what Kestra
    is, which wasn’t very clear at the time.
  sec: 818
  time: '13:38'
  who: Will
- line: I’ve now been in this role for a year as of last week, and it’s been amazing
    to continue the work I loved in open source while also doing more technical demos
    and teaching.
  sec: 818
  time: '13:38'
  who: Will
- line: Congratulations on your work anniversary.
  sec: 843
  time: '14:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you.
  sec: 845
  time: '14:05'
  who: Will
- line: We’ll definitely talk more about developer advocacy, but I’m curious about
    your hackathon experience.
  sec: 849
  time: '14:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Would you recommend that first-year university students do as many hackathons
    as possible, or should they focus more on their studies?
  sec: 849
  time: '14:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: The most valuable things I learned in my first year were at hackathons.
  sec: 861
  time: '14:21'
  who: Will
- line: For example, I learned how to actually use Git, deal with merge conflicts,
    and get things merged so they work.
  sec: 861
  time: '14:21'
  who: Will
- line: At university, we touched on Git, but never really understood it.
  sec: 861
  time: '14:21'
  who: Will
- line: That skill has been very helpful in my career.
  sec: 861
  time: '14:21'
  who: Will
- line: At hackathons, we worked as a team and had to get everything merged quickly,
    so I learned those things fast.
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Will
- line: I also learned how to build real projects, which many of my peers at university
    struggled with.
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Will
- line: Often, they understood the concepts but didn’t know how to combine them into
    a working program and deploy it.
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Will
- line: Hackathons taught me real-life engineering skills that university didn’t cover.
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Will
- line: That said, I wouldn’t say university was a waste of time.
  sec: 940
  time: '15:40'
  who: Will
- line: A lot of the theory is useful for giving you a grounding that self-taught
    coders might not have.
  sec: 940
  time: '15:40'
  who: Will
- line: Even if you don’t use everything, it’s helpful to have that context.
  sec: 940
  time: '15:40'
  who: Will
- header: 'Organizing Hackathons: Leadership, Coordination & Soft Skills'
- line: So hackathons were definitely useful—100% would recommend.
  sec: 964
  time: '16:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did you actually start organizing them?
  sec: 964
  time: '16:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: You said you took part in five during your first year and learned a lot, but
    organizing is quite different from participating.

    out.
  sec: 1016

    of that core group.
  sec: 1016
  time: '16:56'
  who: Will

    and fill in gaps I’d noticed.
  sec: 1016

  who: Will

    because they learn useful skills beyond programming.
  sec: 1040

  who: Will
- line: Working with others and developing soft skills is very valuable when you’re
    part of a team.
  sec: 1040
  time: '17:20'
  who: Will

    I don’t think that’s always true.
  sec: 1090

  sec: 1090

    develop the same technical depth as someone practicing algorithms.
  sec: 1097

    I felt less technical.
  sec: 1097

    and teaching?
  sec: 1097

    open source programs.

  sec: 1162

    I knew so little then.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Will

    is part of why I moved to developer advocacy.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Will

    very technical or are too niche.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Will
- line: What I like about Kestra is that it’s such a versatile product—I get to touch
    everything, not just one specific area of tech.
  sec: 1241
  time: '20:41'
  who: Will
- line: 'It’s a difficult balance, and you have to figure out what you value more:
    being super technical or helping others become technical. It depends on what matters
    most to you.'
  sec: 1241
  time: '20:41'
  who: Will

    work.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can see if you enjoy doing technical work more and slowly move in that
    direction.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, at Kestra, you could start contributing more to the internal
    product rather than focusing only on documentation, if that's possible.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Or, if you enjoy non-technical work more, you could focus on community activities,
    talking to users, collecting feedback, and similar things.It's a nice blend of
    both technical and non-technical work.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Alexey
- header: Role Variety at Small Companies vs. Specialized Teams
- line: Definitely. The beauty of Kestra being such a small company is that every
    month is a bit different. With the open source program, we ran three a year, so
    it became very routine—twelve weeks for the program, a gap, then another program.
  sec: 1322
  time: '22:02'
  who: Will
- line: Some people loved that routine, and I liked it at first, especially when the
    economy was good and companies wanted to spend money on these initiatives. We
    created new courses, like a production engineering course and a web3 course, which
    was exciting.
  sec: 1322
  time: '22:02'
  who: Will
- line: But what I like about Kestra is that I'm not just writing documentation every
    month.
  sec: 1322
  time: '22:02'
  who: Will
- line: For example, we did the Zoomcamp in January, which was very different from
    what I was doing in March. If I worked at a bigger company with a large developer
    advocacy team, I might have a more specialized area. Here, the variety allows
    me to do more technical work if I want, or focus on community-oriented work if
    I prefer. It's a nice blend, and I can lean into one or the other as I like.

    this is not hypothetical, because we want to organize one in DataTalks Club.
  sec: 1398

    How do you come up with ideas? I want to organize one, but I have no idea what
    to do.
  sec: 1398
  time: '23:18'
  who: Alexey

    actually build their projects. The other key part is the demo or presentation.
  sec: 1445

  who: Will

  sec: 1445
  time: '24:05'
  who: Will

    with tables and judges walking around.
  sec: 1445
  time: '24:05'
  who: Will
- line: If you're doing it online, it’s much easier—you don’t need to find a venue
    or organize catering.
  sec: 1482

  sec: 1482
  time: '24:42'
  who: Will

    which is great, and Discord is also popular.
  sec: 1482
  time: '24:42'
  who: Will

    so many resources available that engagement is low.
  sec: 1506
  time: '25:06'
  who: Will

    can discuss their ideas. That’s more useful than running lots of workshops.

  sec: 1526

    stressful, or announce winners later, but then you might lose engagement because
    people move on.
  sec: 1526

    like "Best Use of Sponsor Technology."
  sec: 1574
  time: '26:14'
  who: Will
- line: That was one way I enjoyed hackathons—I would look at the sponsors, try their
    tools, and maybe win a prize.
  sec: 1574
  time: '26:14'
  who: Will
- line: I learned new things and sometimes won cool prizes. I would pick a sponsor
    tool, think of an idea that uses it well, and try to catch the judges’ attention.
  sec: 1600
  time: '26:40'
  who: Will
- line: I enjoyed that approach. Open-ended prizes can be overwhelming because there
    are so many possibilities.
  sec: 1600
  time: '26:40'
  who: Will

    of time and only have a login page that doesn’t work.
  sec: 1600
  time: '26:40'
  who: Will
- line: When you were a participant, you looked at the sponsors and their tools, then
    thought about what you could do with them. It sounds like the problems were open-ended,
    and the hackathon was just about doing something cool with the available tools.
  sec: 1649

  who: Alexey
- line: Was it like that, or did you have a theme or some direction?
  sec: 1649
  time: '27:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, the problem is that if there are no constraints, people don’t know
    what to do and the time runs out. How do you deal with this?
  sec: 1649
  time: '27:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Open-ended hackathons work well for in-person events because people are committed—they’ve
    shown up and there’s free food, so they stay.
  sec: 1719
  time: '28:39'
  who: Will
- line: For online hackathons, it’s harder to keep engagement. If things aren’t going
    well, people can just leave, since there’s no real consequence.
  sec: 1719
  time: '28:39'
  who: Will
- line: Some events have categories like "Best Use of Data" or "Best AI Project."
    These are broad enough to allow creativity but give some focus. Others are completely
    open-ended, and you can use sponsor tools.
  sec: 1745
  time: '29:05'
  who: Will
- line: One prize I won was for "Hackiest Hack." We didn’t aim for it, but our project
    was so barely held together that people said, "This is the most hacked-up thing

    a true type font you could install on your phone or laptop.
  sec: 1784

    emoji—just like how iPhone and Android have different emoji styles, you could
    have a Will emoji.
  sec: 1784

    going to work."
  sec: 1919

    back. We thought you were just messing around—we didn't realize you'd actually
    build it."

  sec: 1961

    end.
  sec: 1966
  time: '32:46'

    a real impact.
  sec: 1972

  sec: 1972
  time: '32:52'
  who: Will
- line: In our case, one person wanted to learn about TrueType fonts, another wanted
    to learn about Microsoft Azure, so we all came out of it feeling good because
    we got to play with new tools we hadn't used before. It worked out well.

    has experience running them. MLH would provide pre-event support and send a representative
    to the event.
  sec: 2026
  time: '33:46'

    with organizations that had open-source projects—like Meta, which has React and
    other big projects.
  sec: 2143

    providing mentorship and structure to help students contribute to real open-source
    projects.
  sec: 2143

  sec: 2342

  who: Will

    had never worked in a Git repository with others before. Some were very strong

    to contribute to a larger project.

    unless you worked at Google. They use tools like Bazel and CMake, everything is
    written in C++, and in the end, I just gave up. I thought, "Do your own thing,"
    even though I was an experienced developer.
  sec: 2476
  time: '41:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: How did you learn these things yourself? Did you work closely with maintainers
    to understand the setup before helping students?
  sec: 2476
  time: '41:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: The students were organized into small groups called pods, about ten students
    each. In the first cohort, every pod had a team leader, usually a senior engineer
    mentoring as a part-time, evening activity. Later, we transitioned to a student-led
    model, where previous fellows would lead the groups, supported by a group of mentors.
  sec: 2543
  time: '42:23'
  who: Will
- line: We worked with maintainers before the project started to understand setup
    and requirements.
  sec: 2566
  time: '42:46'
  who: Will
- line: They would show us how to get the project running, and we’d turn that into
    resources for the students. Sometimes, maintainers would run workshops for all
    the students, and our team would help them follow along.
  sec: 2566
  time: '42:46'
  who: Will
- line: Some projects were straightforward, but others were difficult. Maintainers
    were usually understanding, especially if their own project was hard to set up.
    Over time, we tried to target projects that were more accessible, because students
    often didn’t have powerful computers.
  sec: 2590
  time: '43:10'
  who: Will
- header: Hardware Constraints & Cloud Workarounds (Colab, VMs)
- line: With AI projects, students often lacked enough memory or GPU power, so their
    computers would crash. We provided cloud VMs or encouraged them to use Google
    Colab to get around hardware limitations. Data projects were always the hardest
    because of the computing requirements.
  sec: 2620
  time: '43:40'
  who: Will
- line: As time went on, we avoided projects that were too difficult to set up. For
    example, Meta has many projects, so we could ask them to switch to something more
    accessible.
  sec: 2652
  time: '44:12'
  who: Will
- line: But some companies, like one that used Apache Airflow, insisted on their chosen
    project, and students contributed to specific open issues. Maintainers appreciated
    getting contributions without extra work, but it was always a balance.
  sec: 2652
  time: '44:12'
  who: Will
- line: Not having a powerful enough computer brings back memories for me. I remember
    trying to compile TensorFlow—my computer couldn’t even handle the compilation,
    let alone run the model.
  sec: 2711
  time: '45:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: I had to rent a machine on AWS with 32 or 64 GB of RAM just to compile it.
    Is the MLH Fellowship program still running?
  sec: 2711
  time: '45:11'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Program Scalability: Repeatability, Budgets & AI Opportunities'
- line: Yes, it still runs, though I haven’t been involved since 2023. It runs three
    times a year.
  sec: 2762
  time: '46:02'
  who: Will
- line: Before I left, I helped make the program more repeatable and structured. It
    hasn’t expanded much, mainly because companies have cut budgets for open source
    initiatives due to economic changes.
  sec: 2762
  time: '46:02'
  who: Will
- line: There might be more AI-focused programs soon, which would be exciting. It's
    great to see students posting on LinkedIn about finishing the 12-week program
    and contributing to projects like Airflow. We also worked with the Pallets project—Flask
    and Jinja—and some students even became maintainers. It was rewarding to see people
    go from contributors to maintainers and realize how powerful open source can be.
    That outcome was beyond what we imagined when we started.
  sec: 2797
  time: '46:37'
  who: Will
- line: Do you have to be a student to take part? I know Google Summer of Code used
    to require students, and I missed my chance after graduation. Is it the same for
    the MLH Fellowship?
  sec: 2849
  time: '47:29'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Fellowship Accessibility: Students, Career Changers & Motivation'
- line: Previously, we required participants to be students, since most of MLH’s community
    comes from student hackathons.
  sec: 2890
  time: '48:10'
  who: Will
- line: However, we eventually opened the fellowship to anyone. Some people joined
    while working other jobs and wanted to change careers—they learned Python part-time
    and passed our technical screen.
  sec: 2890
  time: '48:10'
  who: Will
- line: We can’t teach you to code from scratch, but if you have a basic understanding,
    we teach you how to contribute to open source. Some career changers did the program
    part-time and were often the most motivated and successful students we saw.
  sec: 2919
  time: '48:39'
  who: Will
- header: 'Developer Advocacy at Kestra: Documentation, Demos & Outreach'
- line: We're coming to the end, which is sad because I wanted to talk more about
    developer advocacy. Let’s spend the last ten minutes on that. What do you do as
    a developer advocate? What are your main responsibilities?
  sec: 2954
  time: '49:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: We recently hired a technical writer, which has made my life easier. My role
    involves teaching users about Kestra. Workflow orchestration is complex, especially
    with a tool like Kestra, which can be used in many different ways for various
    use cases. If people don’t understand it, they won’t use it.
  sec: 2981
  time: '49:41'
  who: Will
- line: I started by improving documentation and creating videos to teach people how
    to use Kestra and understand its purpose. That approach has worked well. Now,
    with our technical writer AJ—big shout out to AJ—I can focus more on videos and
    educational content.
  sec: 3014
  time: '50:14'
  who: Will
- line: My focus this year is to teach the fundamentals of Kestra and show how to
    implement typical workflow orchestration use cases.
  sec: 3037
  time: '50:37'
  who: Will
- line: I also create content about tools that work with Kestra, like Postgres, and
    demonstrate interesting use cases. My role has become more focused on outreach
    and education.
  sec: 3037
  time: '50:37'
  who: Will
- line: I think what you do is really cool. Some people who create content, especially
    videos, prefer to write a script first and then create a video from that script.
    For others, like me, it's easier to just record the video directly, since writing
    is more difficult.
  sec: 3075
  time: '51:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Which approach do you use?
  sec: 3075
  time: '51:15'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Content Workflow: Bullet Points, Demos & Collaboration with Writers'
- line: I definitely lean more toward your approach. I make rough bullet points about
    what I want to achieve, get a working demo, and then press record, roughly following
    my bullet points.
  sec: 3109
  time: '51:49'
  who: Will
- line: Sometimes I've written blog posts or turned other people's blog posts into
    videos, but I find that following a strict script feels unnatural for me.
  sec: 3109
  time: '51:49'
  who: Will
- line: Now that you have a technical writer on your team, you can make a video from
    bullet points, and the tech writer can help turn that into written content, right?
  sec: 3145
  time: '52:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. We just had a release last week, and we worked together to figure
    out how some of the new features worked. He wrote the documentation page, and
    I made a video to showcase it.
  sec: 3163
  time: '52:43'
  who: Will
- line: Sometimes he creates the documentation first, and I use that as a basis for
    a video, or I create bullet points for him to expand into documentation. It's
    good that the video doesn't exactly follow the documentation, because otherwise
    it would be boring. The video should offer something extra that the documentation
    doesn't. They both have their own purpose.
  sec: 3163
  time: '52:43'
  who: Will
- line: Do you have a good recipe for making a good video?
  sec: 3213
  time: '53:33'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Video Strategy: Define Goal, Maintain Pace & Full Walkthroughs'
- line: The key thing is to have a clear goal—what are you trying to achieve with
    the video? Is it to showcase a feature of Kestra or to teach about a new tool?
    If you don't have a clear goal, it's easy to make the video too long or go off
    on tangents. If I don't understand the goal from the beginning, how will the user?
  sec: 3220
  time: '53:40'
  who: Will
- line: So you open a document and write down the key goal for the video. For example,
    you posted about a new release of Kestra with some features. Let's say you need
    to make a video about one of these features. Can you give an example?
  sec: 3249
  time: '54:09'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Feature Demo Example: "After Execution" Notifications in Workflows'
- line: One of the features was a new workflow component called "after execution."
    My main goal was to explain why we added this feature and why it's useful. On
    its own, it just runs once an execution is finished, but the value is that you
    can use it to send notifications with the actual status of the workflow.
  sec: 3270
  time: '54:30'
  who: Will
- line: If the workflow failed, it will say "failed," whereas if it runs during the
    workflow, it will say it's still running. So I put myself in the user's shoes
    and think, "Why is this useful to them?" I build my examples around that goal.
  sec: 3270
  time: '54:30'
  who: Will
- line: So you prepare a document, or maybe just keep it in your head, with the goal
    to showcase the new feature. Then you think of a good example, like sending a
    Slack or Telegram notification, and show exactly how to implement it. Is that
    right?
  sec: 3332
  time: '55:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. When making guide videos, I don't like to cut corners. I show everything
    from step one to the end result. I find it frustrating when technical videos skip
    steps, like setting up Google Cloud, and just assume you know how.
  sec: 3356
  time: '55:56'
  who: Will
- line: I want to show the whole process, from opening Google Cloud to connecting
    it to Python, so viewers aren't left confused. At the same time, I keep a good
    pace, because on YouTube, pacing is everything.
  sec: 3356
  time: '55:56'
  who: Will
- line: If a video is too slow, people tune out and the video doesn't do well. For
    example, our installation guide for Kestra on Google Cloud is 15 minutes long,
    which is reasonable. If an installation video is an hour long, people won't even
    try the tool.
  sec: 3356
  time: '55:56'
  who: Will
- line: Maybe a last question before we wrap up—what are you working on right now?
  sec: 3436
  time: '57:16'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Learn with Kestra Series: Tool Tutorials (Docker, Postgres, Git)'
- line: We've started a new "Learn with Kestra" series focused on demoing tools that
    Kestra works with. Instead of making videos just about Kestra, we make videos
    about other tools and then show how Kestra can be useful with them.
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Will
- line: For example, we did one on Docker—explaining what Docker is, why you might
    use it, and how to run containers with Kestra. We did the same with Git. These
    aren't always the best examples of workflow orchestration, but I'm planning one
    on Postgres soon, which is a great use case.
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Will
- line: People want to automate querying and loading data into a database, so I'm
    looking forward to making those examples.
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Will
- line: The start of the video won't talk about Kestra—it will teach why Postgres
    exists and why it's popular. I'm hoping to expand to other tools, like cloud platforms
    such as Google Cloud and AWS. So far, these videos have done well on the channel.
    I'm also working on a video about UV, a new Python package manager. I like to
    try new things to see if they're just hype or actually useful. It's fun for me
    and for the viewers.
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Will
- line: I just went to YouTube, typed "Kestra" in the search box, and found the channel.
  sec: 3554

    subscribe button. They need more subscribers, and Will's content is awesome.

  who: Alexey
- line: You'll learn a lot by watching.
  sec: 3554
  time: '59:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe the last thing—do you have any book or resource recommendations for
    the listeners?
  sec: 3578
  time: '59:38'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Leadership & Team Empowerment Recommendation: "Turn the Ship Around"'
- line: When I was at the fellowship, managing a group of student leaders, I felt
    overwhelmed and unsure if I was giving enough support, especially early in my
    career.
  sec: 3599
  time: '59:59'
  who: Will
- line: Someone recommended the book "Turn the Ship Around." It's about leadership
    styles on a Navy ship and how to empower people to lead themselves, rather than
    just follow commands. After reading it, my team felt more empowered, open, and
    honest. If you're working with volunteers or community members, it's a great read
    for anyone who wants to be a better leader.
  sec: 3599

- line: Thank you, and I hope you forgive me for keeping you four minutes longer.
    Thanks a lot, Will—it was amazing talking to you.Thanks for sharing your stories
    and insights and for the recommendations. I'm sure many listeners will find them
    useful.
