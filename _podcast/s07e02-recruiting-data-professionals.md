transcript:
- line: "This week, we'll talk about hiring data professionals. We have a special\
    \ guest today, Alicja. Alicja worked for almost six years at Zalando as a recruiter\
    \ with a focus on hiring data scientists. I think at Zalando they\u2019re called\
    \ \u2018applied scientists\u2019. At some point, they renamed this, but before\
    \ it was research scientists, data scientists \u2013 you had a bunch of data professionals.\
    \ I actually met Alicja during a recruitment process as well \u2013 she was trying\
    \ to hire me multiple times."
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Even though Alicja no longer works at Zalando, and I think you\u2019ll maybe\
    \ tell us a bit more about that later \u2013 you don't focus on data professionals\
    \ specifically anymore. But when I was thinking about who to invite to this interview\
    \ \u2013 who to talk to about hiring data professionals \u2013 I couldn't think\
    \ of a better candidate. Welcome to our event."
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure.
  sec: 180
  time: '3:00'
  who: Alicja
- header: "Alicja\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go into our main topic of hiring data people, let's start with your
    background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 184
  time: '3:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I started over 10 years ago in recruitment. Like most people, I kind of fell\
    \ into it. I started working in a recruitment agency, a very small one, and then\
    \ I moved onto in-house recruiting. I didn\u2019t become a headhunter, but rather\
    \ a part of an internal recruitment team at Google, where I spent two years hiring\
    \ site reliability engineers, which was quite challenging."
  sec: 193
  time: '3:13'
  who: Alicja
- line: After that, I decided to move to Berlin and I joined Zalando. I actually first
    joined as a sourcer, then I became a recruiter. The last couple of years, I was
    also leading a team of recruiters who recruit data professionals and product designers.
    So that was my journey so far.
  sec: 193
  time: '3:13'
  who: Alicja
- line: And what do you do now?
  sec: 184
  time: '3:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right now I am part of WeAreKeen, which is an embedded talent agency. So I
    kind of went to the other side. What we do is go into companies and help them
    scale their tech teams. We get kind of embedded, so we do the usual things that
    an internal team would do. We do this in Berlin as well as in Amsterdam, but really,
    we are operating globally these days with remote work.
  sec: 186
  time: '3:06'
  who: Alicja
- line: "It\u2019s not just data folks, but any tech professionals,"
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: "We are tech-focused at the moment. I'm in the role of a client lead, where\
    \ it's a bit more on a strategic level \u2013 doing project management and helping,\
    \ advising, and consulting different companies and clients."
  sec: 269
  time: '4:29'
  who: Alicja
- header: The hiring process
- line: Interesting. We will probably talk more about the work you were doing as Zalando,
    but I guess the process is similar, where you look not just for data folks, but
    usual tech professionals as well. So I'm curious, what does the hiring process
    look like? What are the typical steps in the process?
  sec: 284
  time: '4:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "A lot of the time, of course, the process overall will depend on the company.\
    \ But typically, from what I see, especially in tech and for data science, there\
    \ is usually some sort of recruiter interview as the first step. Not always, but\
    \ typically. Then there is a technical screening, which is usually one hour-long\
    \ interview with a data science interviewer and that's much more technical. And\
    \ then, there is a final round, which is physical on-site interviews, which is\
    \ why we call them \u201Con-sites\u201D. However, now they're mostly virtual due\
    \ to the current situation."
  sec: 306
  time: '5:06'
  who: Alicja
- line: In that final run, typically, it could be anything from two or three, all
    the way to five or seven interviews. Again, it depends on the company and how
    big they are. Also, sometimes this process may not be as organized or as structured.
    After that, obviously, there is the decision round and then the final decision
    is made.
  sec: 306
  time: '5:06'
  who: Alicja
- line: I guess even before that, the process also involves sourcing candidates or
    doing CV screening, right?
  sec: 371
  time: '6:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, of course. When I talked about the process, I guess I just kind of explained
    the recruitment or the interviewing process. But, of course, before we even get
    into that stage, there is a lot of stuff that has to happen beforehand. First,
    we naturally need to have candidates who are willing to go to those interviews.
    Especially when it comes to data professionals, that process could take a while.
  sec: 380
  time: '6:20'
  who: Alicja
- line: "Then, after the interviews, there is another stage where the decision is\
    \ made, and if the decision is positive (we want to hire someone) we need to make\
    \ an offer \u2013 we need to talk about the conditions and come up with a contract\
    \ and then onboard that person."
  sec: 380
  time: '6:20'
  who: Alicja
- header: Sourcing and recruiting
- line: "That\u2019s quite a lot of work. And what do you do in this process? What\
    \ is your role in this process?"
  sec: 421
  time: '7:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: "The role all starts whenever there is a need, or a demand \u2013 and obviously,\
    \ the budget also has to be there to hire someone like a data scientist or data\
    \ engineer. Typically, there\u2019s also a hiring manager, which could be anyone,\
    \ such as an engineering manager, a data science manager \u2013 basically someone\
    \ in the team who can hire and who wants to hire. This person would contact the\
    \ recruitment team or myself directly and say, \u201CI want to hire a data scientist,\
    \ can you help me?\u201D"
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Alicja
- line: "That's where it starts. This is where we have an initial meeting with that\
    \ person to establish what they're really looking for and come up with the job\
    \ description to make sure that it's aligned with their needs. During this process,\
    \ we try to establish, \u201CWhy do we need this person? Why are we hiring externally?\u201D\
    \ and \u201CDoes this person really need all of the skills that are mentioned?\u201D\
    \ Sometimes there are certain expectations, but they don\u2019t always match what\u2019\
    s available on the market. The talent market is super tough when it comes to hiring\
    \ data professionals. It's not easy, there's high competition."
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Alicja
- line: "In a way, it\u2019s kind of a negotiation sometimes with the hiring managers\
    \ \u2013 depending on the hiring manager \u2013 as to what realistically is possible\
    \ and what is not. Going through the job description, making sure it's attractive,\
    \ and that people will actually want to apply to it. Also, at this stage we decide\
    \ what the interview process will be, \u201CWho will be the interviewers that\
    \ will take part? What kind of interviews do we absolutely have to do? Which ones\
    \ could we maybe omit?\u201D If there is some flexibility in that, of course.\
    \ So it\u2019s getting into very kind of nitty-gritty practicalities about everything.\
    \ At which point, the hiring manager will talk to the people who will talk to\
    \ the candidates."
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Alicja
- line: That's quite a lot of things.
  sec: 539
  time: '8:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's where it starts. Yes. Of course, then there are two folds. When hiring
    data professionals, and I think tech people in general, it's a very competitive
    market, but from my experience more so when it comes to data scientists or data
    engineers, we do obviously post the positions. Typically, every recruiter would
    always post the open position, but the number of applicants that apply isn't always
    aligned, so we can't rely on that because we would probably never hire them. This
    is where sourcing comes in.
  sec: 542
  time: '9:02'
  who: Alicja
- line: "Although some recruiters do both, some companies have separate sourcing teams\
    \ where there are people who just source candidates and don't even interview them.\
    \ But what I did in the beginning of my journey at Zalando was \u2013 I started\
    \ as a sourcer for data science and then I became a recruiter for data science.\
    \ It goes down to actually actively approaching candidates or people who wouldn't\
    \ apply because they don't have to. They get messages on LinkedIn, or they may\
    \ be happy in their jobs and they don't even think about applying. This is why\
    \ sourcing is often a big part when it comes to hiring data professionals. I'm\
    \ not sure if I'm answering your question."
  sec: 542
  time: '9:02'
  who: Alicja
- line: "The question was, \u201CWhat do you do there?\u201D I think you only partly\
    \ answered it, because I think there's more, right?"
  sec: 628
  time: '10:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. So, it's quite a long journey. Let's say we post the job and also we\
    \ typically simultaneously source for the candidates. We start reaching out to\
    \ them on LinkedIn, but any other ways that a sourcer can find you \u2013you might\
    \ have experienced this yourself \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s even through Facebook,\
    \ Twitter, Reddit. There's so many \u2013 GitHub is another one. Maybe not so\
    \ much for data professionals, more so for software engineers, but any ways we\
    \ can find and get in touch with people we think are right, that's what we would\
    \ do."
  sec: 637
  time: '10:37'
  who: Alicja
- line: Even on Reddit?
  sec: 673
  time: '11:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I personally haven't done that, to be honest. But I know some sourcers
    who are really quite geeky, and they like to come up with new ways. I'm not sure
    how they do this exactly.
  sec: 675
  time: '11:15'
  who: Alicja
- line: So if you want to get hired, go to Reddit and post after this interview. [laughs]
  sec: 689
  time: '11:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, I mean. [laughs] Yeah, there are many, many different ways. Also, looking\
    \ at University alumni, especially for data professionals \u2013 if we're looking\
    \ for people who need to have a certain level, like PhDs, we look at the alumni\
    \ of universities. We also look at conferences. When I searched for data science\
    \ people, I looked at that a lot \u2013 the machine learning conferences and the\
    \ papers that were submitted. Sourcing is a big part of the process and it takes\
    \ a while. It's a long-term strategy of trying to hire data professionals."
  sec: 694
  time: '11:34'
  who: Alicja
- line: "This also comes along with partnering with the hiring manager. At this point,\
    \ it depends on the sourcer \u2013 if there's someone who's just starting as a\
    \ sourcer or doesn\u2019t yet fully understand what they're looking for \u2013\
    \ because as recruiters, we are not technical people, we don't have computer science\
    \ degrees. It also takes us a while to understand what the right profile is. This\
    \ is why we typically partner with hiring managers, or interviewers, or people\
    \ in the team, or other data scientists within the company, in order to understand,\
    \ \u201CAre those the right type of profiles \u2013 those who apply and the ones\
    \ I reach out to?\u201D Then, hopefully, we do have some candidates and we put\
    \ them through the process."
  sec: 694
  time: '11:34'
  who: Alicja
- line: "I would start with the recruiter interview, spend some time discussing people's\
    \ motivations, and also discuss the practicalities of what they will be looking\
    \ for. Then we go through the stages \u2013 as a recruiter, I will be the one\
    \ that takes that candidate through all the stages \u2013 starting from the recruiter\
    \ interview, then technical screening, and then the on-site interviews. As we\
    \ go, I provide feedback from those interviews, and then all the way up to the\
    \ offer, including making them an offer. So that's the end-to-end recruitment\
    \ process, or as we sometimes call it, \u201C360 recruiters\u201D. There are also\
    \ recruiters who don't do the whole part, but I think more often these days, you\
    \ just do everything."
  sec: 694
  time: '11:34'
  who: Alicja
- line: "You also then make the offer to the candidate and I think that's something\
    \ I, as a recruiter, enjoy doing \u2013 being able to go through this journey\
    \ with someone and at the end, make them an offer, and hopefully they accept it,\
    \ which is even nicer. So making an offer, and then making sure that if they accept\
    \ it, they also get their contracts."
  sec: 694
  time: '11:34'
  who: Alicja
- header: Managing expectations
- line: "That\u2019s a lot of work. You mentioned quite a few interesting things that\
    \ I wanted to ask you about. First I wanted to ask about, apart from Reddit which\
    \ was also quite interesting \u2013 but what really got my attention is, you mentioned\
    \ that when a hiring manager comes to you saying \u201CI want to hire a data scientist\
    \ or applied scientist.\u201D You first will kind of negotiate with them \u201C\
    What is realistically possible?\u201D Does this happen often when they come with\
    \ a profile that doesn't exist and you have to manage their expectations?"
  sec: 837
  time: '13:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: "[reluctantly] Yes. That's a part of the challenge. This is also why I actually\
    \ said to you, when you first reached out to me, that I no longer recruit for\
    \ data science. But still, it's all very close to my heart. In the very beginning\
    \ of my career as a sourcer for data science, in the first six months I think\
    \ I was not able to make a hire. For a recruiter this is an important thing to\
    \ know when you are a candidate, because you need to understand that recruiters\
    \ are there to make hires, which means they are actually, in a way, on your side\
    \ \u2013they want you to sign that contract. They will do everything possible\
    \ to make sure \u2013 obviously, within the ethics of the job \u2013 but we will\
    \ do anything possible to make sure you sign it, and that you are happy in your\
    \ job."
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Alicja
- line: "In the first six months of working as a recruiter, I didn't actually make\
    \ any hires. I wasn't able to find anyone, and this was quite a challenge. Sometimes\
    \ a big part of that is the expectations that some hiring managers have. Later\
    \ on down the line, I was very lucky to have very good hiring managers at Zalando,\
    \ who really understood the market. Over time, we were able to build these relationships\
    \ with each other. There was an understanding that if a hiring manager comes to\
    \ me saying, \u201CI need three principal data scientists.\u201D [laughs] I would\
    \ say \u201CThat's very funny.\u201D But I was comfortable to say that, of course,\
    \ because I knew that they understand that this is not going to happen in the\
    \ next month. I would typically say, \u201CYeah, it's going to be a minimum of\
    \ six to nine months before we hire the first one.\u201D This is very often the\
    \ thing."
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Alicja
- line: "I think sometimes it's because hiring managers don\u2019t necessarily have\
    \ the data science background themselves. It could be that they're an engineering\
    \ manager, so they have a software engineering background, but they need to hire\
    \ data scientists for their teams. This is where I, as a recruiter, would need\
    \ to provide them with more advice and give them insights of the market, \u201C\
    What are the profiles that are available? What is realistic?\u201D Oftentimes,\
    \ they would understand that and that would be fine. So we would agree on \u201C\
    Okay, what are the must-haves and what can we compromise on?\u201D"
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Alicja
- line: "So you have this information. You can say, for example, \u201COkay, finding\
    \ this kind of experience with Kubernetes is very difficult in the available data\
    \ science profiles.\u201D Right? Then if the hiring manager really insists on\
    \ having this profile, you will need to say that, \u201COkay, this severely reduces\
    \ the number of candidates that you would have for this position.\u201D"
  sec: 1010
  time: '16:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: "With data, obviously, you have to. I think, especially in tech recruitment,\
    \ but especially when dealing with data scientists, I've noticed this is the thing.\
    \ You just need to have the data to show them and that's the easiest way to convince\
    \ someone. Then it's not about my gut feeling then. As a sourcer, and also as\
    \ a recruiter, you're able to gather this data \u2013 LinkedIn also has tools\
    \ like Market Insights. A lot of recruiters have access to that. Some of us don't,\
    \ and then you have to get a bit more creative. But you can still show them, at\
    \ least roughly, \u201COkay, this is what the market looks like, so the more must-haves\
    \ you add, the narrower the funnel is, and the less talent is available.\u201D\
    \ That helps to drive the conversation."
  sec: 1038
  time: '17:18'
  who: Alicja
- header: Making the job description attractive
- line: "Interesting. Another thing you mentioned is \u2013 you work with the hiring\
    \ manager to make sure that the position (the job description) looks attractive.\
    \ How do you do this? By carefully picking the words or how exactly does that\
    \ work?"
  sec: 1091
  time: '18:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it was always the case where I wouldn't write the job description
    myself. Because I don't know what specific AI tools or methods in machine learning
    have to be in the description or how to word it so that it actually makes sense
    to someone reading it (the data scientist). I would always first ask the hiring
    manager to draft a job description and we would have some format that has to be
    followed. Then we would just check that the wording makes sense.
  sec: 1108
  time: '18:28'
  who: Alicja
- line: "But I think it's also about understanding that it\u2019s not just about putting\
    \ the right buzzwords in, but rather being able to really show what the person\
    \ will be doing. When I was going through sourcing and working with hiring managers,\
    \ I found out that data scientists, or data professionals, like to know what kinds\
    \ of problems they will be solving. They get excited about the problems. So being\
    \ able to write a job description that focuses on \u201CThis is actually the problem\
    \ we have right now and you'll be part of the team who is trying to solve it.\u201D\
    \ That's what gets people\u2019s attention and excitement and not just saying,\
    \ \u201COh, yeah, we have perks and benefits like free lunches or coffee.\u201D\
    \ Yes, that's great, but it's not as exciting."
  sec: 1108
  time: '18:28'
  who: Alicja
- line: Free lunches are good as well. [laughs]
  sec: 1193
  time: '19:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I agree. Yeah. [laughs] But when it comes to making a decision to switch\
    \ jobs\u2026"
  sec: 1195
  time: '19:55'
  who: Alicja
- line: That's not enough, right?
  sec: 1202
  time: '20:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It doesn't flip the scales. Another part of actually writing job descriptions\
    \ \u2013 this is something that is maybe more recent \u2013 there are actually\
    \ AI-driven tools that allow us to go through the job description and tell us\
    \ things like, \u201CWhat kind of audience will this job description attract?\u201D\
    \ Right now, as you might be aware, there is a big conversation about having more\
    \ inclusion and diversity, in tech especially. When it comes to gender diversity,\
    \ for instance, there are certain tools that are able to tell us like, \u201C\
    Okay, this job description that you've just written is really speaking louder\
    \ to men (or people who identify as men) more so than a woman. So if you're actually\
    \ trying to balance out your team a little bit, maybe you should change these\
    \ keywords.\u201D And it gives you an indication of what kind of words you can\
    \ swap. That's actually something that is AI- or ML-driven, which is quite interesting\
    \ and it can be helpful as well."
  sec: 1204
  time: '20:04'
  who: Alicja
- line: "Yeah, thanks. I think I also used this tool. It would say, \u201COkay, this\
    \ phrase (I don't remember the exact examples), will appeal more to male candidates.\
    \ If you want to be more inclusive, consider changing it.\u201D And then it gives\
    \ a couple of suggestions."
  sec: 1271
  time: '21:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. It makes it more neutral.
  sec: 1289
  time: '21:29'
  who: Alicja
- header: Selecting profiles during sourcing
- line: "Let\u2019s talk more about sourcing \u2013 you now posted it, you negotiated\
    \ the requirements with the hiring manager, you\u2019ve made an attractive job\
    \ description. Now you go live with this description and people start applying.\
    \ But you also mentioned that it's not enough. You also need to actively reach\
    \ out to people. You go to Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, or LinkedIn, and people say,\
    \ \u201CHey, you have this amazing job description. How about having a chat?\u201D\
    \ In this case, how do you select profiles? What piques your attention here?"
  sec: 1292
  time: '21:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Typically, to be honest, there are many tools you can go through. But I think
    LinkedIn is a good starting point, usually, because you can at least get an idea
    of who's available. It also has quite interesting filters. I can filter out for
    years of experience, or the degree levels, and things like that. Then I can put
    Boolean strings of keywords. It's quite good in that respect. So that will be
    a good starting point.
  sec: 1333
  time: '22:13'
  who: Alicja
- line: "What I would do is look at profiles that matched the initial keywords, or\
    \ the job description that I have in front of me, or based on the discussion that\
    \ I had with the hiring manager, the most. First, I try to narrow it down to whatever\
    \ is the \u201Cideal\u201D case scenario. This way I know where those people are\
    \ and who they are. Then I verify that with the hiring manager to see, \u201C\
    Okay, these are the initial results. I haven't reached out to those people yet,\
    \ but what do you think? Is this profile correct?\u201D Because, as I said, I\
    \ might not really know if I'm just starting out in the field."
  sec: 1333
  time: '22:13'
  who: Alicja
- line: "So what stands out? Something I look at quite a lot when going through LinkedIn\
    \ and sourcing is the experience and also the education. I think this is something\
