short: Decoding Data Science Job Descriptions
title: Decoding Data Science Job Descriptions
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about decoding the data science job description. We
    have a special guest today, Tereza. Tereza is an experienced data practitioner.
    She worked as a data science manager, a data scientist, data engineer, product
    manager, and she is leading a coaching team right now. Tereza, you’re actually
    doing so many things. [chuckles] She's a core organizer of the PyLadies Hamburg
    Group, she's hosted regular meetups with the community, and she's also a PSF Code
    of Conduct and Diversity and Inclusion Working Group Member. What is PSF, by the
    way?

  who: Alexey
- line: Python Software Foundation.
  sec: 137
  time: '2:17'
  who: Tereza
- line: Okay. Welcome to our event.
  sec: 141
  time: '2:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you.
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Tereza
- header: Tereza’s background
- line: Before we go into the main topic of today, which is understanding job descriptions,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 147
  time: '2:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Well, I guess I have a traditional career journey to data science, plus
    being at the right place at the right time. I studied computer science. I come
    from Romania and then I came to Hannover to do my diploma, and then I stayed to
    do a PhD. That's what you do after graduation. But anyway, then it was lucky because
    my PhD was in information retrieval and recommender systems and all that – that
    was in 2011, when there were not so many people doing it.
  sec: 160
  time: '2:40'
  who: Tereza
- line: That led me to get a job at XING. I remember back then, I applied for senior
    Perl developer in the data team and I thought, “How hard can it be? I did three
    months of Perl coding during my internship at Microsoft, so I guess I can apply
    for a senior Perl developer position.” I mean, that is the only job they had on
    the platform. So I applied and it turns out in the interview that I didn't actually
    know that much about Perl, but I did know stuff about recommender systems. [chuckles]
    So I got the job then.
  sec: 160
  time: '2:40'
  who: Tereza
- line: XING is a job search portal in Germany, right?
  sec: 227
  time: '3:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. And in Austria – so the DACH area. I stayed there for like
    three and a half years, I think. Then I took a year off doing artsy things and
    kind of trying out startup-y stuff. Then I wanted to work with data again and
    I started working at mytaxi, which is now called FREE NOW. I joined first as a
    data engineer because that had to be fixed before you do data science. Then after
    we set everything up, after a year and a half, I think, we started the data science
    team. With that, I was there I think four and a half years in the end. Then I
    left and I started at Neuefische first as a coach – I wanted to just do it for
    like six months and then go do my break thing. But then I stayed. I felt like
    that we, as the coaches, needed to build up the team and also have career paths
    for coaches, not just for students. It's going to be almost two years now in September.
  sec: 232
  time: '3:52'
  who: Tereza
- line: Then I started with PyLadies already when I was at FREE NOW. I felt like I
    didn't really have a clique in Hamburg, like peers to exchange with. I've been
    in many companies, where I was like the only woman developer. It's nice to be
    a pioneer, but not really. So that's why we started PyLadies in Hamburg, because
    we saw that Berlin one was pretty active and then we did it in Hamburg also. One
    thing led to another and there was more stuff to do for the community and more
    interesting stuff. I think it's really important and it's also quite rewarding
    in the end.
  sec: 232
  time: '3:52'
  who: Tereza
- line: So you tried pretty much everything. First, you worked in academia as a researcher,
    then you joined XING as a data scientist, then you joined another company as a
    data engineer – so you built the data engineering platform, the data pipelines
    there – then you became a data scientist again, then you lead a team (you started
    a team) which means you are like a manager, right? You were managing the team.
  sec: 346
  time: '5:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, not really. Basically, when I was working at XING, you have to understand
    that I was working at XING doing data science from 2011 to 2015. We were writing
    code in Scala. Our recommender systems were ElasticSearch, doing smart, interesting
    queries on ElasticSearch.
  sec: 369
  time: '6:09'
  who: Tereza
- line: That hasn't changed. [chuckles] I mean, that's how people do it.
  sec: 391
  time: '6:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Right. Okay. But it was really product-driven, so it had to be needed
    – it was not so much researching stuff. I think when I came to FREE NOW, and we
    were looking at data science, back then everybody was talking about Python, Python
    – and so many libraries, and everybody was doing things differently. Then it was
    like, “If I would have done my PhD now, things would have been way faster than
    doing my PhD in Java,” right? I mean, you had to implement your own Lucene. Remember
    Lucene? It was just so much grinding back then to write code.'
  sec: 396
  time: '6:36'
  who: Tereza
- line: Anyways, what was lacking when we started with the data science team, we had
    a lot of people – we had people that had been from data engineering, or data analytics,
    but they were kind of not experienced in this product mindset. So it was more
    like cool experiments that look nice in a Jupyter Notebook, but then they weren't
    ever bridging to something where it actually gets used by someone. That work that
    has to be done was not really well planned and stuff. So I ended up actually doing
    product management until we hired someone for the product management role. And
    then I took the leadership role.
  sec: 396
  time: '6:36'
  who: Tereza
- line: That's interesting. Were you hired as a data scientist first and then you
    realized that you need to build this data platform sort of thing, or they hired
    you as a data engineer first? Or as a data person in general? [cross-talk].
  sec: 473
  time: '7:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I applied, there were not many jobs in Hamburg in 2016, when I decided
    to work again with data. That was a problem. There was mytaxi – I mean, of course,
    there was OTTO and XING. But I've been at XING and I wasn't going to go back.
    Also, I kind of learned at XING that I cannot function in a company the size of
    XING or larger, so I was definitely not gonna go to OTTO. There were not many
    things besides that. So there was Goodgame Studios for games, not that I'm particularly
    interested in making people play more games, so it wasn't a complete culture fit
    for me on that side.
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Tereza
- line: With mytaxi, at least I had used the app and I found it very useful back then
    – it was the only thing where you didn't need cash in the morning. It was like
    being stranded somewhere and you need a taxi and you don't have cash – it's very
    traumatizing. So basically, the job description I applied for was BI Developer.
    Really unattractive title, especially because I've seen we had different nomenclatures
    of jobs. BI people were people that were working on XSO and just doing inquiries
    and reports and had zero interaction with data science – I’m talking about 2012
    now, things probably have changed. Here, it was different. So BI development was
    basically what you would now call an ETL Developer.
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Tereza
- line: The first thing I did, they gave me the option, “You could join the data analytics
    team – you would do dashboards in Tableau.” And I was like, [laughs] “No… I don't
    think that's interesting for me.” “Or you help us build a data platform.” The
    ETL back then at mytaxi was (you would be surprised) but there were PostgreSQL
    queries glued together in Maven, because the person who originally built it was
    a Java developer. [chuckles] I have never seen before… [cross-talk]
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Tereza
- line: Well, at least it worked, right?
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: It worked. [chuckles] We had to put this on Airflow and back then Hadoop was
    quite popular. So I saw the building blocks and I thought… Well, I've been there
    and saw the whole data infrastructure being built – I saw it happening. I wasn't
    really getting involved. But it turned out that I had a lot of passive knowledge
    out of that. That was helpful and I applied it. The first thing I did was change
    the job title. I said, “I can't put that job title on my CV. Ever.” [laughs] Also,
    we cannot hire anybody – nobody's gonna apply. It's just a different market.
  sec: 615
  time: '10:15'
  who: Tereza
- header: Working as a coach
- line: Now your work as a coach. So what do you do as a coach? How's it different
    from your previous jobs?
  sec: 660
  time: '11:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, now I don't have to worry about not caring about the product that I'm
    working on or not. [laughs] Because I am just teaching people how to be responsible
    data scientists, so that whenever they go and do stuff, they are not destroying
    other people's lives and are doing cool things with data. At Neuefische we're
    doing data science boot camps – me and my team. There's also data analytics and
    web and Java and AWS. We added a large product part in the data science bootcamp,
    because I feel that that's actually the part that is stopping people from getting
    stuff done. And a lot of teamwork, too.
  sec: 667
  time: '11:07'
  who: Tereza
- line: We are teaching students that are coming from different backgrounds how to
    be data scientists that you would want to work with. I don't know how to say this
    – not like someone who finishes university and they just learn all the tools,
    but they can't work in a team because universities don't teach working in teams
    and all sorts of things. Basically that.
  sec: 667
  time: '11:07'
  who: Tereza
- line: We also get a lot of PhDs and you know how it is with PhDs. I think when you
    perceive people, you don't know whether the person did a PhD or not. But a lot
    of people think, “Well, a person who did a PhD, they worked alone the whole time.
    They don't collaborate well. They don't handle criticism well.” But this depends
    on where they did it – some PhDs are completely different, of course. But you
    hear a lot of people that say, “Oh, we already hired a lot of PhDs. It didn't
    work well. We're not hiring PhDs anymore.” It's like companies just go 180 on
    this. [cross-talk]
  sec: 667
  time: '11:07'
  who: Tereza
- line: Funny that you mention that. I remember there was a time when companies would
    hire only PhDs. And you're saying now that companies think “Oh, well, yeah – we
    tried that. Didn't work. Let's not hire PhDs at all.” [chuckles]
  sec: 788
  time: '13:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [chuckles] Why does it have to be so black and white? Then, of course,
    we are 10 coaches – so we are working as a team and trying to find sustainable
    ways of working and growing. The field of data just is so fluid at the moment.
    It just changes all the time and you have to stay on top of the game a little
    bit.
  sec: 802
  time: '13:22'
  who: Tereza
- header: Identifying the mismatches between your needs and that of a company
- line: Actually, what we wanted to talk about in this interview is decoding (understanding)
    data scientists’ job descriptions. A while ago, you gave a talk with the same
    name, or a similar name, Decoding the Data Science Job Description. That is a
    great talk and I wanted to talk a bit about that here. You started the talk by
    saying that there is a mismatch between expectations and reality for both candidates
    and companies.
  sec: 833
  time: '13:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think we talked a little bit about this already, like with hiring PhDs –
    first companies expected that they would just hire a bunch of PhDs and things
    would magically happen and then things didn't magically happen. “Okay, something
    must be wrong with the PhDs, so let's not hire them.” There is some mismatch,
    right? Can you tell us more about this? Why does this mismatch happen?
  sec: 833
  time: '13:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Talking from the company perspective, I think companies are (not all the companies,
    of course), but most companies – just imagine, you go on LinkedIn and you look
    at data science jobs, and then you get depressed and you close LinkedIn. You're
    wondering “Where is that feeling coming from?” Right? There's a lot of copy/pasting
    going around and you have this feeling like they're not really intentional – there's
    no intent in how they're writing this job description. It’s just about, “Hey,
    we need to hire some people. Let's copy what other people are writing and let's
    hire some people.” I think this can come out, but sometimes you don't have a choice
    and you have to go with it. First, companies don't usually know what they want
    – what they need.
  sec: 880
  time: '14:40'
  who: Tereza
- line: Sometimes they find out through the job interview process. They don't hire
    the first person, the second person – by the fifth person they interview, they
    have “done their research” and now they know who they want to hire. This happens,
    right? But sometimes the way interviews are done in most companies, it has a different
    aim. Instead of telling a person, “This is what you're going to do at work over
    the following period. Does this align with your needs?” You tell the person, “Hey,
    these are all the things that you need to know.” Then the job interview is about
    understanding if the person is smart. Also, can we understand if the person is
    smart with the least effort possible? So we start with the Take Me Home Challenge,
    which we say it's for four hours, but everybody knows it's [cross-talk]
  sec: 880
  time: '14:40'
  who: Tereza
- line: Least effort for the company side, right? Not for the candidate?
  sec: 982
  time: '16:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For the company side, it's four hours. They say that, but then in the
    end, if you want to do a good job…
  sec: 985
  time: '16:25'
  who: Tereza
- line: It’s like a month. [chuckles]
  sec: 990
  time: '16:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, a month sometimes. For example, there are some companies that put the
    take-home challenge very early on in the interview process.
  sec: 991
  time: '16:31'
  who: Tereza
- line: Yeah, I remember I had a case when, even before talking to a human – it was
    just an automatic email saying, “Hey, please do this take-home challenge.” And
    I thought, “Okay. Well, let me just do this.” I didn’t know that something was
    off there. So then I did and they said, “Oh. Sorry. I actually forgot to close
    the position. We already hired somebody.” [scoff] “Yeah, thank you. Thanks for
    telling me about that in advance.”
  sec: 1003
  time: '16:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Exactly. Especially in large companies, if they have a lot of PR out
    there and nice branding – a lot of people apply and then it becomes this work
    to review those people. And I'm not sure if every company is allocating enough
    resources to have proper interviews of people. It's more like, “Oh, yeah. We will
    figure it out in the probation period – if it works out or not.” But Germany is
    not a good country to fire people during the probation period. It's not really
    normal. I think it happens in other countries more often, that people get fired
    way faster. But in Germany, not so much.
  sec: 1032
  time: '17:12'
  who: Tereza
- line: But in general, I guess it's not… I imagine for a candidate who got hired
    and had some expectations and for the company, letting people go is also stressful.
    I am a manager and I cannot imagine how difficult it is to fire somebody. It's
    stressful for both sides, right?
  sec: 1076
  time: '17:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. But I've also heard quite often that people got a job and it
    turned out to be completely different than what they expected. I think, on the
    other side, regarding the goals of candidates – a lot of people don't really sit
    down by themselves and write down their goals. People also sometimes just go a
    little bit uninformed to the job interview. Just imagine if you're a manager,
    you've had interviews with people – imagine how many people didn't ask questions.
    There are some people that don't ask questions, and you're like, “Hmm… interesting.
    Is this person applying for 100 jobs so it doesn't matter where you're getting
    a job?” [chuckles] Basically, find out what is important for you and inform yourself
    if that's happening. People take it for granted that the stuff that is important
    for them is going to be fine and it's not the case.
  sec: 1094
  time: '18:14'
  who: Tereza
- line: To summarize, the misalignment – at least from the companies’ point of view
    – happens because, first of all, companies don't know who they want/need. And
    second is, they want to do it with the least amount of time from their side. Right?
    Coming back to your story of how you ended up at mytaxi – you applied for a BI
    developer and this wasn't exactly what they needed, right?
  sec: 1164
  time: '19:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The title was wrong. [laughs]
  sec: 1192
  time: '19:52'
  who: Tereza
- line: Was the description also wrong? Or it wasn't?
  sec: 1195
  time: '19:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I think the description… hmm… Let me remember.
  sec: 1199
  time: '19:59'
  who: Tereza
- line: '[chuckles] It was a while ago, right?'
  sec: 1205
  time: '20:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was a while ago, but basically, I read the description and thought – this
    is data engineering in 2016 – so I thought “This is data engineering. You set
    up a data warehouse and you create the platform for the analytics team to work
    on,” basically. But it was definitely not BI development. [chuckles]
  sec: 1206
  time: '20:06'
  who: Tereza
- line: Let's say we're a candidate and we want to apply for a job. We come across
    a job description, and we don't want to get hired, start working, only then to
    find out that it's not what we want. Because leaving the company is stressful,
    and it’s even worse being fired. [cross-talk] If you’re let go, that's even worse.
  sec: 1233
  time: '20:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Even having a lot of job interviews is a lot of time. If you think about it
    as a pyramid, you can look at 100 job descriptions, you can probably pass the
    first interview round with 20 – how many take-home challenges can you have? If
    you think about five take-home challenges, that’s like five weeks of your time,
    if you want to do it right. And then you take just one job. So the further down
    the interview line you go, it becomes more of a time-consuming effort.
  sec: 1256
  time: '20:56'
  who: Tereza
- header: How to avoid misalignments
- line: What companies do first is CV-screening rounds, where they will look at the
    candidate’s CV. The job description is a similar thing, but from the other side
    – for the candidates. So how can we make sure that description matches what we
    want?
  sec: 1290
  time: '21:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. First of all, you have to think about what you want. [chuckles] And
    you also have to think about where you are in your career, because this changes
    what you need a little bit from what you want. I think, in general, you need to
    identify the overlap between needs and wants, because wanting something might
    still be the wrong thing to have. For example, a person that’s at the beginning
    of their career, working in a data science team that’s not a team – it's just
    one person – it’s not going to be very rewarding for them or helping them out
    with their growth because they will end up doing all sorts of random things that
    are probably not really data science-related.
  sec: 1310
  time: '21:50'
  who: Tereza
- line: So you have to have some experience. You need to know that if you're a junior
    or just graduated from university or from a bootcamp – starting a team or starting
    as a sole data scientist in a startup might not be the best idea. Right?
  sec: 1359
  time: '22:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: But there are some people that have the personality for it.
  sec: 1375
  time: '22:55'
  who: Tereza
- line: It’s not for everyone.
  sec: 1379
  time: '22:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, they need to be able to thrive in this “chaos” [chuckles] experiment
    often and figuring stuff out. But then there are people that want to take it slow
    and have stability and enjoy their time. Then you need a bigger company, and you
    need a bigger team. You need a team where stuff is defined, processes are defined,
    and you just have to do your thing for a bit.
  sec: 1381
  time: '23:01'
  who: Tereza
- line: This is on one side, from the candidate perspective. You need to identify
    with yourself – are you at the part where you still need to get good at the tech
    part, on this little specialization thing that you're doing (whether it's data
    science, or analytics)? Or are you at the part that you should get good at generalizing.
    Like, “Okay, I can do all of the data science part, but I want to know machine
    learning engineering and I also want to learn MLOps, and also the analytics part,
    because I want to be able to better monitor my models. I want to go all over the
    place. I'm not there yet. What is the right order to do this? It depends, right?
    For some people, order works and for some people, it doesn't. This is a personality
    thing. In my talk, I was structuring things based on, basically, if you can find
    information about the team, if you can find information about the role itself,
    if you can find information about the culture of the company, and also about (I
    added new things) the retention.
  sec: 1381
  time: '23:01'
  who: Tereza
- line: What is down the line, if you think about it, in a couple of years? What would
    it still look like? Would you still be there? Sometimes it matters. Sometimes
    you are at the part where you just want to have a couple of jobs in your CV or
    you're exploring so and then it doesn't matter. You can be somewhere for six months
    and then in another place –you need to ramp up. But sometimes you want to be there
    longer. On all of these aspects, I think it's important to do a little bit of
    research to figure out if it's a match. It's either a fit, or there's stuff that
    is a little bit borderline. Then you have to find out in the further down the
    interview if stuff is there, or missing or wrong. And if there is, is it because
    of ignorance, or it's because it's intentional?
  sec: 1381
  time: '23:01'
  who: Tereza
- header: Considering what’s mentioned in the job description, what isn’t, and why
- line: And by “stuff is there” you mean in the job description? What kind of stuff?
  sec: 1536
  time: '25:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For example, things like why the team is not mentioned in the job description.
    Is that because the company doesn't know how to write a job description? Or is
    it intentional – because there is no team? [chuckles]
  sec: 1540
  time: '25:40'
  who: Tereza
- line: A good example would be “We are looking for a data scientist to join our search
    implementation team,” right? Then it's clear which team it will be. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1553
  time: '25:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: And the area where the team is working.
  sec: 1563
  time: '26:03'
  who: Tereza
- line: Alright. And if it's like, “Okay, we're looking for somebody with five years
    of experience in data science and Perl, AWS and Docker (and just a bunch of things)
    then apply here.” And you're thinking, “Okay, well… what exactly is this?” Right?
  sec: 1565

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, you're like, “Hmm. I guess they're desperate? They searched all this
    online and this is what people are hiring these days and they also want to want
    to?” [laughs] Or something. I don't know. So kind of like this. Sometimes the
    job description is not enough to figure out why something is there or not there.
    If it's on purpose, or if it's the first time they are hiring, or it's a new person
    writing the job description, or they didn't do proper research. It can also be
    that it's harmless – just out of ignorance.
  sec: 1580
  time: '26:20'
  who: Tereza
- line: Do you maybe have some sort of a checklist? Things that we should try to find
    in the job description – and if they are missing, we should ask about them. Some
    things you said should be mentioned are the team and an area where you work. Are
    there any other things?
  sec: 1620
  time: '27:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For example, for a data science job – data science is the part that
    comes down the line of data, right? It's not the stuff that the company starts
    with. So if you want to make the data people applying relaxed about it, you should
    just mention the fact that you already have a data engineering platform, that
    you already have a data infrastructure, that you already have a data analytics
    team. But you can also see this from the information of what they want.
  sec: 1638
  time: '27:18'
  who: Tereza
- line: If you are applying as a data scientist and they ask you all sorts of tools,
    like all the tools, all over the space of data, then you already know that you're
    not really gonna do data science. [laughs] Basically, on the checklist, on the
    team side, I would say to figure out if there's a team mentioned. How is that
    team mentioned? What do they say about the team? One thing that is also borderline
    with culture here is – do they have juniors in the team or not? Maybe they don't
    have juniors in this team, but they have juniors in other teams. This is taking
    it to the culture level.
  sec: 1638
  time: '27:18'
  who: Tereza
- line: I guess this is not something you check in the job description, but rather
    maybe go to LinkedIn and see who the people who work in this company are and whether
    there are people with the junior title.
  sec: 1717
  time: '28:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, yeah. Another thing is, in the job description – the role itself
    has must-haves and then the nice-to-haves. These are your responsibilities and
    things you do at work. This can range from being well-defined to being a bullet
    point, a tech stack of all the tools that are out there. This is a nice paradigm
    that not a lot of people are using – having objectives already mentioned in the
    job description.
  sec: 1727
  time: '28:47'
  who: Tereza
- line: If you think about it, which kind of job would you apply for? One that says
    “You have to have a PhD in whatever, plus three years work experience,” or “In
    the first six months your task is to improve the performance of three of our machine
    learning models.”? I’m saying this as a joke, but like, can you get a PhD in three
    years work experience in six months? No. And then the job itself is improving
    machine learning models. I mean, you’re really missing out on talent just by having
    this. Because I wouldn't apply if I wouldn't have a PhD and they asked for a PhD,
    right?
  sec: 1727
  time: '28:47'
  who: Tereza
- line: Objectives. So we need to have a team mentioned, then responsibilities should
    be well-defined – with objectives, not just a list of technologies, right?
  sec: 1809
  time: '30:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not like, “Hey, it would be nice if you know everything, because maybe some
    of the stuff is going to be actually relevant to something that we are going to
    be doing. We don't know yet what we're doing.” This is how I would interpret it.
    Like, “We have absolutely no idea what this person is supposed to be doing, so
    we're just putting all the possible skills,” which might actually not be the case.
    Again, ignorance versus intent.
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Tereza
- line: But this is something to think about when you have the first/second interview
    to ask them, actually. So at least you need to do some homework and figure out
    “Okay, what do I really need to ask them?” And the job description is a good indicator
    if they know who they want or not.
  sec: 1844
  time: '30:44'
  who: Alexey
- header: Diversity and culture of a company
- line: The other thing is, also, if they talk about diversity on the job description.
    I think “equal employment opportunity,” saying whether they care about diversity
    or not. Most of the time, I think it's starting to be the normal thing to do,
    whether it's part of the culture or it's just PR/marketing – that's something
    to find out in the interview process. But wording that is off-putting is already
    a sign of lack of diversity – the language on the job description.
  sec: 1863
  time: '31:03'
  who: Tereza
- line: For example, if I see a job description that hires a “rockstar,” or a “ninja”
    or something I don't apply. I just don't even actually have that conversation
    further. It’s 2022 – maybe three years ago, this would have been ignorance, but
    now I just think “You have a team that is thriving on competition and not on collaboration.”
    It's just like that, you know? I would never recommend anybody to apply to a job
    that has terms like that.
  sec: 1863
  time: '31:03'
  who: Tereza
- line: Like “ninja” or “rockstar”. This is something we actually talked about last
    week on the podcast with Olga. We discussed a tool that analyzes the language
    of the job description, and it says [cross-talk]… Sorry?
  sec: 1942

  who: Alexey
- line: The Gender Decoder.
  sec: 1962
  time: '32:42'
  who: Tereza
- line: I don't know if it's a gender decoder, but it says “Avoid using this word.”
    Or not “avoid” but they say, “If you use this word, it will attract more males
    than females. So consider changing it to this.” For example, for me as a candidate,
    maybe I'm ignorant and I don't always see these red flags, but now you mentioned
    “rockstar, ninja,” are there other things that you would consider, maybe not red
    flags, but good indicators that something might be off?
  sec: 1964
  time: '32:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let's see. Well, a lot of bullet points is off-putting. From the research
    that I was doing for this talk, it’s actually a sign of a rigid interview process.
    The thing is, the person interviewing you will end up asking you questions that
    you could just Google. It’s not questions about how you think about solving a
    problem, (which is what you actually have to do at work in the end) but they're
    gonna ask you syntax questions for random tools or programming languages that
    they have there.
  sec: 2013
  time: '33:33'
  who: Tereza
- line: Again, this goes back to the culture of the interview practice. This is work
    that can be done on the candidate’s side. Most of the companies actually do not
    put in the work to fix their job description on gender decoding and all sorts
    of things. Sometimes, you might feel that you like the company and you like the
    role, but you read the job description and you don't really feel like applying.
    Then you realize that it's because of the language. Or you don't even know – this
    happens subconsciously. It's not like, “Oh, I don't like it.” You know? There
    was this research that shows that, apparently, women apply less to jobs that have
    this off-putting language, but also women actually get more of the jobs that they
    apply to because they do this research more often. Whereas, maybe for men, there's
    less information on the job description that would make it off-putting.
  sec: 2013
  time: '33:33'
  who: Tereza
- line: But there are words that trigger this. For example, there’s a junior position
    and they’re saying, “We're expecting you to work fully autonomously,” [laughs]
    Who’s gonna do that? Or have that expectation of a junior? It depends. I mean,
    you want some autonomy, but you also want some goals or some guidance. I don't
    know. I know good examples – very rare examples – that when they are there, you
    feel like “Oh, that is such a nice job! I don't need this job. It's completely
    out of my range of expertise.” There's very few like that. I've seen a job that
    had short paragraphs about every team member, “This is the person you're going
    to work with.”
  sec: 2013
  time: '33:33'
  who: Tereza
- line: Interesting. That doesn't happen often, right? [chuckles]
  sec: 2191
  time: '36:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. [chuckles] Exactly. You see that they put a lot of effort in creating
    that job description. There’s also job descriptions where I like the style – they
    tell you, “This is what you're gonna do in your first two weeks, what you're gonna
    do in the next three months, and what you're going to do in the next six months.”
    [cross-talk]
  sec: 2196

  who: Tereza

  sec: 2218

  sec: 2222

  sec: 2224

  who: Alexey
- header: Lack of a salary in the job description
- line: Exactly. You could put it in the job description. I mean, for people doing
    job descriptions, when you have a lot of repetitive questions asked in the interview
    by the candidate, you could just as well add it. Lack of salary on the job description
    – I know most companies have a lack of salary.
  sec: 2228
  time: '37:08'
  who: Tereza
- line: In Germany, it's very difficult to find companies that actually put salary
    on the listing.
  sec: 2250
  time: '37:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, especially because we want to [smiles, laughs] Newsflash for everybody,
    it is no longer illegal in Germany to talk about your salary. And newsflash for
    companies expecting people working at your company to not talk about salaries
    being naive about it. It is really more expensive to lose employees because of
    lack of transparency on the salary, then to just fix the salaries. Basically,
    every time I talked to someone that was saying, “Yeah, I have a job opening. I
    would love to put the salary, but I can't.” And then I think, “Oh, I think this
    is why you don't put the salaries, right?” And they're like, “Yeah, that's why.”
  sec: 2257
  time: '37:37'
  who: Tereza
- line: And the reasons are, “We have not fixed the salaries internally. We have older
    people that don't have the right salary and/or people in different regions that
    don't have the right salaries. That’s why we can't write the salary in the description.”
    In the end, every piece of information that you think comes from not putting the
    salary on the description is true.
  sec: 2257
  time: '37:37'
  who: Tereza
- header: Way of doing research about company where you will potentially work
- line: Okay. You mentioned a couple of times that it's important to do some research.
    For example, to see how many juniors are in the company by going to LinkedIn and
    checking it. How do we actually do this? In addition to checking how many juniors
    there are in the company, what else can we do? Do we just go to Google, put in
    the name of the company, and look at the first page? Or is there an approach that
    we can take?
  sec: 2331
  time: '38:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Some companies (the smaller startups) actually have the team on their website.
    You can take a look there and you see the color of the people, the gender of the
    people – and if you feel represented by that, or if you want to contribute to
    their lack of diversity, then go for it. I think that's one way. There are some
    companies where going to LinkedIn or asking or whatever and just checking who's
    working there – third degree network, second degree network. Another thing on
    the team part is something people don't really think about – you spend 30% of
    your time with work colleagues.
  sec: 2358
  time: '39:18'
  who: Tereza
- line: Some of us – not everybody – but some of us are at parts in our careers where
    we like to work with people that inspire us. This is something you can find out
    – are there any people in that team or in that company that you find inspiring?
    Any role models? You can check through conference talks, meetups, and so on. That's
    something that’s taking it an extra mile further. You can also check past employees
    on LinkedIn. You can also figure out past employees and see how long they worked
    in the company. Also, another thing regarding career pipelines – sure, you can
    ask in the interview about the career path, whether they have pipelines for the
    career and whatnot. But you can [cross-talk]
  sec: 2358
  time: '39:18'
  who: Tereza
- line: Career pipeline is a career ladder – junior, middle senior, and so on, right?
  sec: 2459
  time: '40:59'
  who: Alexey

    change their jobs within the company.
  sec: 2464
  time: '41:04'
  who: Tereza
- line: Like, how many become seniors, right? Or how many become managers?
  sec: 2474
  time: '41:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: For a lot of people – for many bigger companies – it usually takes a moment
    of crisis to figure out that they have to fix the culture. And that moment of
    crisis happens in every company at some point – it turns out that it's easier
    to get promoted by just leaving the company than staying. After a lot of people
    do that, then they realize, “Oh, we need to fix this. Apparently we have a problem.”
    [chuckles] And then they start to have a nice culture. This is fine, it's just
    good to know about it, right? Because then you know where you are and what do
    you have to do about it? Maybe it's really important for you to have a two-year
    job and then move on, because the team is still great to learn from and people
    are great to learn from. But you also know that some of those people that are
    great to learn from are going to leave while you're there, because they are going
    to feel disenchanted with the process.
  sec: 2479
  time: '41:19'
  who: Tereza
- line: Basically, you check LinkedIn, check what people are doing, check what the
    company is doing, what kind of statements they make online. I think one of the
    things that everybody has to decide for themselves is – do they need to care about
    what products the company is making? What is the mission of the company? What
    are the things that the company is creating? What are the values of the company?
    Because I think it depends. Some people want job stability. They're old school
    – that's how it was before. You worked somewhere for 30 years. That's how it was.
    And now you work somewhere for three years, and then another place for three years.
    Job stability is no longer the thing, so you want to be motivated. You want to
    enjoy your work and you want to learn because you like learning, and it's cool
    and stuff. So maybe then it is important that you are motivated. But this is something
    that you have to learn about yourself. Not everybody needs to care about the environment
    and so on.
  sec: 2479
  time: '41:19'
  who: Tereza
- header: How to avoid a mismatch with a company other than learning from your mistakes
- line: Yeah. That goes back to what you mentioned at the beginning. So you need to
    first understand what you want before starting to read the job description and
    see if this matches what you want. First, you need to understand what you want.
    By the way, is there any good approach to this? Let's say I don't want anything
    particular – I just want to have a job. How can I approach this?
  sec: 2625
  time: '43:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Of course, I can learn from my past mistakes – or maybe not mistakes, my “mismatches”.
    For example, I worked at a company where it was very difficult to work from home.
    Then I interview for the next company and I ask for this in advance, like “Okay,
    can I work from home?” With COVID, I guess everyone had to work from home but
    before that, it was a thing that I would ask, is there any… [cross-talk]
  sec: 2625
  time: '43:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can also ask about what kinds of processes they have in place for people
    to successfully work from home. You have to agree, working from home and being
    completely remote is not an organic process. It needs support, right? It needs
    work. If that doesn't happen in a company, then you will go into here one year
    later, “We've decided that everybody has to come to work. Oh, and we don't have
    parking lots.” Like at Tesla. [laughs] Sorry.
  sec: 2684
  time: '44:44'
  who: Tereza
- line: I guess one thing you can do is learn from experience. Okay, you have to go
    to the office, but now that you have already signed the contract, you come to
    the office in your car and find out that there is no parking lot. And then it's
    an “oops” situation. Then the next time you look for a job, you will ask about
    this.
  sec: 2719
  time: '45:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: But is there a systematic way of thinking “What do I actually want? What do
    I actually need?” Instead of making all these mistakes and learning from them
    – instead of going and signing up for a job that maybe does not match what you
    need? Is there a systematic way to figure out what you need when you don't have
    10 years of experience, for example?
  sec: 2719
  time: '45:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, actually, it depends on each person. For some people, the culture won't
    matter because they are the majority, so they won't notice these things. If you're
    part of an underrepresented group, then the culture will matter more than other
    things. So you need to prioritize what is most important to you. Is the mission,
    the culture important? You have to be aware that if the culture matters to you,
    then you need to know to go work at a company that has a good culture, because
    working on fixing the culture takes away from your development – career development.
    And then you're like, “Oh, why am I not growing in my career as fast as other
    people?”
  sec: 2762
  time: '46:02'
  who: Tereza
- line: Maybe you are at that part in your career where it's not so expensive to not
    learn as fast. You need to prioritize you, basically. You can do this list, “OK,
    I need the team, I need the mission. What do I have? I have the team, the role,
    the culture, and retention. So what is really important for me? Do I care about
    the culture more? Do I care about the team? Do I care about…” Which ones are must-haves
    and which ones are “Okay, it's fine if it's not.”?
  sec: 2762
  time: '46:02'
  who: Tereza
- line: Take the team, for example. If you're experienced, then it doesn't really
    matter if the team is large or small, or created or not – you can make a team.
    But if you're at the beginning of your career, then you probably care about the
    team quite a lot and who is in that team. Then again, retention – if you're experienced,
    the retention part might matter more, because if a lot of employees are quitting
    often and stuff like that, that's a sign of something not being done right. It's
    going to be frustrating down the line and you're going to manage to do a lot of
    stuff at work. There's a reason behind it. The other thing that’s also really
    important – the company may have a data science job description, but do they really
    need a data scientist?
  sec: 2762
  time: '46:02'
  who: Tereza
- line: How do you find out?
  sec: 2910
  time: '48:30'
  who: Alexey
- header: Before data, during data, after data (a company’s data maturity level)
- line: Well, so that's what you have to actually find out. First you have to figure
    out if they actually have a data infrastructure. I think in my talk, I was talking
    about companies that are “before data,” “during data,” and “after data”. So which
    stage are they in? Before data, they don't need a data scientist. They need to
    start tracking and they need to start with the culture with the data. Then, while
    they're becoming data-driven, they probably have a data infrastructure and then
    they have data scientists.
  sec: 2912
  time: '48:32'
  who: Tereza
- line: But again, most of the stuff that data scientists are doing doesn’t actually
    make it to production, because it's not an established culture in the company.
    There's going to be a lot of advocacy going on. A good question to ask in the
    interviews would be something like, “Who in the company wants the company to be
    data-driven?”
  sec: 2912
  time: '48:32'
  who: Tereza
- line: “Who in the company wants the company to be data-driven?” Interesting.
  sec: 2961
  time: '49:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, it's the same with diversity, right? If a company wants to start
    being diverse and everything, it has to be a top-down move. If the C-level doesn't
    push for it, they will actually resist it. The same for data culture – it's a
    culture shift.
  sec: 2967
  time: '49:27'
  who: Tereza
- line: Going from not being data-driven to being data-driven is a culture shift.
    It doesn’t really happen overnight. It happens with a lot of stuff – disrupting
    day-to-day work. Every team needs to be told “That's the way we are going and
    that's where we are going” and not be like, “We only go there if it's easy, or
    if we can do it on Friday.”
  sec: 2967
  time: '49:27'
  who: Tereza
- line: Why does it matter? For me as a candidate, why does it matter at which maturity
    stage a company is? If it's before data, during data, or after data?
  sec: 3013
  time: '50:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I think it's more to kind of figure out or identify what the work you're
    going to do will be. With data science, there's all this visualization about this,
    this, this – you gather the business people, figure out what the business value
    is? What are you building? Why are you building it? Then you get the data, and
    then you do some modeling, and then presenting and whatnot. Now, how big are the
    slices in the pie? Where is your effort gonna go? That kind of stuff.
  sec: 3024
  time: '50:24'
  who: Tereza
- line: If it's “before data,” most of your work is going to be in just communicating
    with people. It's going to be the first kind of communication, like getting business
    proposals and stuff. It's not going to be so data-related. Maybe you're going
    to do some modeling, but there's just no infrastructure to help you with putting
    that out there if the infrastructure is not there.
  sec: 3024
  time: '50:24'
  who: Tereza
- line: There's communication and then building this infrastructure and then maybe,
    finally, after three years, there’ll be that training of the first linear regression.
    Right?
  sec: 3094
  time: '51:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. And then the team that you're going to give this to are going to be
    like, “Wait, but we were already doing it differently before and it was working.
    Now you're making us lose our jobs?” This is also a funny question to ask, “Okay,
    so your company is this old? When did you start doing data stuff?”  If they say
    that they were something like eight years old when they started doing data and
    now they're one year in the process of doing data. One year is not enough for
    a culture shift. The company is still in the culture shift.
  sec: 3101
  time: '51:41'
  who: Tereza
- line: This is more about knowing if this fits you. Are you a good communicator?
    Or are you introverted and just want to do the thing? Or are you really tech oriented?
    Because this is not going to be a good space for you. If you are a good communicator,
    then you're gonna thrive there. Of course, you're not going to become this stellar
    data scientist that would have gotten the stage to do fancy models all the time.
    But maybe go more into product.
  sec: 3101
  time: '51:41'
  who: Tereza
- line: A couple of years ago, there was this impression that what data scientists
    do at work is the same kind of stuff you would do at Kaggle. You would get a clean
    data set, train a model, squeeze everything from this data as much as possible
    and then you have this perfect model that you just deployed. If a company is at
    the “before data” level, good luck, right? There is no data at all. [chuckles]
    So before you can do squeezing… [cross-talk]
  sec: 3177
  time: '52:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: “What is this data tracking?” “Oh, we didn't track this because nobody thought
    we would need it.” And you're like, “Okay…” I mean, this happens in bigger companies.
    The other thing you have to understand, I think, because of this mentality of
    what data science was, and you talk to people – they're working on a project and
    you ask them, “So what did you do?” And they always tell you, “Yeah, we trained
    the model to do this. And to predict that.” And then you're like, “Why? Why did
    you do that? For whom? How are they using it?” If you don't do this extra step,
    then that stuff is going to be so much work to actually getting it. By the time
    you get to the “why,” you figured out that nobody actually had the problem you're
    solving. [chuckles]

  who: Tereza
- line: But yet they still decide to hire you. Because maybe consultants from McKinsey
    came and said, “Hey, you need to be data driven, so you need to hire one data
    scientist or two data scientists. Here's this awesome slide deck. Goodbye.”
  sec: 3254
  time: '54:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. This can happen, yeah. There's also the other kinds of companies that
    have AI or machine learning as part of the company title.
  sec: 3271
  time: '54:31'
  who: Tereza
- line: Yeah. Then they have to have a data scientist, right? [chuckles]
  sec: 3283
  time: '54:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: But also oftentimes they're like, “Oh, man. We have AI in the title – we need
    to do fancy machine learning.” And the data scientists are like “Yeah, but linear
    regressions solves the problem.” “No! It has to be AI.” So I think sometimes the
    story is a little bit different where machine learning/data science is at the
    core of the company product and that is the product. Like, you don't do image
    recognition without images.
  sec: 3287
  time: '54:47'
  who: Tereza
- line: The example I gave when I was giving a talk on the product at FREE NOW was
    like, “Hey, you order a taxi from A to B. You're sitting there and you're ordering,
    and it tells you it's going to cost 10 euros. How often does the user ask themselves
    ‘How is this model behind this price performing?’” [laughs] Are they sitting there,
    using an app and thinking, “Hmm… I wonder what model they're using for this.”?
  sec: 3287
  time: '54:47'
  who: Tereza
- line: You're probably wondering, “Okay, 10 euros is too much for this trip.” Or
    “Oh, 10 euros! Good price. Let me take it.”
  sec: 3356
  time: '55:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. And then it was eight euros and you're happy or it was 12 euros
    and you're like, “Hmm, it lied to me. Maybe next time, I will be a bit skeptical
    about this.” It's a jungle out there with the job description.
  sec: 3363
  time: '56:03'
  who: Tereza
- line: And how can we determine from a job description at which level the company
    is? To see if it’s mature enough? Is it before date, during data, or after data?
    I guess there are some signals in the description that we can use? Right?
  sec: 3381
  time: '56:21'
  who: Alexey
- header: The company’s tech stack
- line: The next step. I think I think I once looked at a job description in the energy
    domain and it had a tech stack that I've never heard of. It was like not even
    Python. [chuckles] I mean, it sounded like everything was done with Excel. I don't
    have anything against Excel. Excel still happens. But still…
  sec: 3395
  time: '56:35'
  who: Tereza
- line: The question is, “Do you want to be the person who changes this to the “modern
    stack”?”
  sec: 3420
  time: '57:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So checking the tech stack. But for this, you need a little bit of experience
    with that, to figure out “Do the things from this tech stack belong together?
    Or is it a little bit all over the place?” Because if it's all over the place,
    then it's maybe not the thing.
  sec: 3428
  time: '57:08'
  who: Tereza
- line: Or to see if there is any tech stack at all, right? Like, do they mention
    cloud? If they don't, maybe they don't have it yet.
  sec: 3451
  time: '57:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Although asking people to be experts in AWS for a data scientist job
    is also something that’s a little bit off. In the end, you can learn it, right?
    If you have people to learn it from. Maybe it's mentioned in the job description
    that they already have data engineering. They can mention the structure of the
    department, for example.
  sec: 3460
  time: '57:40'
  who: Tereza
- line: And if it's not mentioned, then you can use something or other. With XING,
    can you also do this for a company? Can you see what kind of people work there?
    Like the titles and all that?
  sec: 3499
  time: '58:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, you can also see what kind of jobs people on LinkedIn
    have and if they don't have the website of the company – this is, of course, for
    larger companies. For smaller companies, sometimes you hear, “We don't care about
    titles.”
  sec: 3511
  time: '58:31'
  who: Tereza
- line: Is it a good thing or not? It depends.
  sec: 3529
  time: '58:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. It depends.
  sec: 3532
  time: '58:52'
  who: Tereza
- line: One more thing maybe to check is if the company is doing any talks at conferences.
    Do they have a tech block? I think this is also a good indicator that they want
    to share knowledge. Okay. I think that would be it for today. Do you want to add
    anything? Maybe you forgot to mention something today? Is there anything you want
    to say before we wrap up?
  sec: 3535
  time: '58:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, maybe that the talk that we mentioned is on YouTube. The slides and
    everything as well.
  sec: 3560
  time: '59:20'
  who: Tereza
- line: I will include the link.
  sec: 3569
  time: '59:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: In that talk, in the slides description, there's a lot of links to read up
    on each of these aspects. But, yeah. I think more people should do research and
    invest their time wisely, right?
  sec: 3571
  time: '59:31'
  who: Tereza
- line: That's the main takeaway, right? “Do research.”
  sec: 3586
  time: '59:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: And put some pressure on companies to write better job descriptions. Stop
    applying at jobs that are bad or just write them “Sorry, I would love to apply
    for you, but this job description is really off-putting at the moment. Maybe you
    can fix that.”

- line: How can people find you?
  sec: 3607
  time: '1:00:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Twitter, LinkedIn. That’s it
  sec: 3609
  time: '1:00:09'
  who: Tereza
- line: Twitter, LinkedIn. Okay. [chuckles] Yeah, thanks a lot. Thanks for joining
    us today. Thanks for answering questions. And thanks, everyone, for joining us
    today. That was fun.
  sec: 3613
