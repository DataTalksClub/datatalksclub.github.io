short: From Data Manager to Data Architect
title: From Data Manager to Data Architect
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about the journey from being a data manager and transitioning
    to a data architect. We will discuss it from both the technical and leadership
    perspectives. Today, we have a very special guest, Loïc. This is not the first
    time you see Loïc here. Previously, he gave a talk about building a data lakehouse.
    He mentioned many interesting things like being a data architect and being the
    Data Manager. During that talk, we thought that it would be a really awesome idea
    to have Loïc again on our show but as a podcast guest, where we can talk in greater
    detail about his career, what he's doing, what he was doing and how he made the
    transition.
  sec: 105
  time: '1:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Loïc is the data lead at MyLight 150. That's the name of the company, right?
    He'll probably tell us more about what he does there. He has more than 10 years
    of experience in the data space in various roles from being a data manager, doing
    database management, doing data engineering, being a product owner, being a tech
    lead, being a data architect, and being a data lead. A lot of stuff. Thanks a
    lot for finding the time to join us today for this interview, Loïc. Let's start.
  sec: 105
  time: '1:45'
  who: Alexey
- header: Loïc's background
- line: Before we go into our main topic, let's begin with your background. Can you
    tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 195
  time: '3:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. In a nutshell, as we say, I started as a data manager back in 2013,
    working in the UK in a company called SIXENSE by now. I was doing a lot of data
    management, gathering data and just making reporting available for other people
    (stakeholders) mainly dealing with civil engineers and the civil engineering industry
    in general – the construction industry. Then I became interested in the data engineering
    side of things just because I was maybe frustrated a little bit with gathering
    all the data together, mix and matching CSVs, XMLM – whatever the format it could
    be together. I became a data engineer – it was a really technical part of data
    engineering, like ETL, groupdash and so on.
  sec: 204
  time: '3:24'
  who: Loïc
- line: Then as time goes by, you focus more on what other people require in terms
    of data and needs – what their needs are – so I took positions as a data consultant
    at CGI back in France. Then I was a project owner (technical lead) in a sort of
    data factory team. And right now I'm the data lead at MyLight 150 What do I do
    there? It's a mix of two hats, maybe a bit more. The first one is very technical
    – we put together (as you may see it in the previous talk we gave on the lake
    house) this was a very operational side of things, let's say. The second hat is
    about the management of the team. I guess there were a series of questions just
    to transition through the career and through those really technical parts to somehow
    more of a leadership role. So that's it with my background, I guess.
  sec: 204
  time: '3:24'
  who: Loïc
- header: Data management
- line: When I heard the term “data management,” what I had in mind was more like
    managing a team, so what you do now. But from what you described, I understood
    that it's a different role. It's more like an analyst role in a non-tech company,
    where you would get a lot of different data from different data sources, and your
    job was to prepare reports.
  sec: 344
  time: '5:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it was exactly this. My customers were basically civil engineers – they
    required a lot of data to analyze the good health of their structure (by the way,
    the practice is called structural health monitoring, where you look at the structure
    and you check for cracks that advance and so on) and my goal was just to take
    data from a lot of sensors that we were installing in the city and buildings,
    and just mix and match them together to provide trends and analysis.
  sec: 374
  time: '6:14'
  who: Loïc
- line: In today's nomenclature of data roles, this looks more like a data analyst
    role, but at that time, it was called data management. Because it involved a little
    bit more than just data analysis, like putting the data together and saving it,
    and sharing it. Also, there was a lot of the data discovery side. So that's why
    it was called data management at the time.
  sec: 374
  time: '6:14'
  who: Loïc
- line: So it's like a combination of data analyst and data engineer.
  sec: 436
  time: '7:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but more of the data analyst side, actually. Then I transitioned to
    data engineering, because I was spending days – hours of my days – just mixing
    and matching data. Also, I have a civil engineering degree. Nothing to do with
    data or IT or whatever, but I was always taking the computer science-oriented
    specialties in school. I was very aware of how to program and how to deal with
    databases and so on. Naturally, I wanted to automate my work of binding all of
    this data together. I remember I was spending probably eight to ten, twelve hours
    a day mixing and matching data. In the end, I was taking like one two hours just
    to automate a little bit. Then the next day, for one or two hours, you automate
    another bit of it.
  sec: 441
  time: '7:21'
  who: Loïc
- line: In the end, you work extra hours at the beginning, but you have a fully automated
    process a few weeks later. This was what basically got me into data engineering
    – automating data analysis work got me into data engineering. It was, “Okay, if
    I automate the end of the process, maybe it's going to be interesting to automate
    the data source to the consumption of the data.” I really enjoyed automating the
    end result, so I was like, “Okay, I could basically do this for a living – automating
    data processes.” So this is how I got into data engineering.
  sec: 441
  time: '7:21'
  who: Loïc
- header: Loïc's transition to data engineer
- line: So you became a data engineer within the same company, right?
  sec: 561
  time: '9:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. Data management at SIXENSE was very broad in terms of practice.
    We would install IoT devices and you were to configure the data loggers, for example,
    to reach the data from sites, the ETL process to load it into the database, and
    then the reporting process as well – from the database to the software solution
    we were providing. All of this required everything to maintain the full data pipeline.
    There were a lot of different aspects to the data manager position – it was a
    very broad role. But you could do most data analysis, a bit of data engineering,
    and sometimes, when you want to do statistics on your data to understand the trends
    and so on, it was data analysis/a bit of data scientist to understand what's causing
    the trend or whatever. So it was a very broad role – data management. I really
    liked the data engineering side of this, which when I think about it, was maybe
    linked to the fact that I really liked software programming. This was the part
    that I could have more control over. Maybe this is just me liking the controlling
    side of things.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Loïc
- line: But also, as you mentioned, you have a degree in civil engineering. So for
    you, all this data that was captured on sensors about cracks, sediments, and all
    this stuff – you could really make sense from this data, right? You could make
    sense of this data, you could understand what's happening there, you had all of
    this domain knowledge. Did it actually help you with the transition from being
    a data manager to data engineering?
  sec: 659
  time: '10:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: What helped with transition was me spending a lot of my spare time learning
    about software engineering good practices, reading about all the database management
    and CRUD operations and all of this – more investing my personal time on learning
    the data engineering things. But it is true that as I knew who was going to consume
    the data that we were producing, it was a big plus because I knew when something
    was wrong, I could diagnose where the data quality problem started to happen or
    whatever. In the end, this first job as a data manager transitioning to data engineering
    was really the perfect job because it was in the civil engineering industry –
    I was reporting to civil engineer and construction managers. But I got two feet
    inside the data space straight away.
  sec: 687
  time: '11:27'
  who: Loïc
- line: It was a perfect transition from my degree. We are talking about the transition
    from data manager to data architect, of course – data engineering. But the transition
    was actually a civil engineering background to the data space. If you look at
    the market today, a lot of people are switching careers and usually, they do it
    after a few years in the work – like they work in finance for a few years and
    then they realize, “Okay, what I really liked was the data,” whatever. But in
    my case, straight after my diploma (graduation) I knew I wanted to do something
    else other than civil engineering. And it's very fun because at the school where
    I studied, there were always these charts about what the people in the school
    are becoming like 10 years down the road and there was this category of 15–20%
    of the students that work in a field that is in no way related to what they studied.
    So I am in this category right now. [chuckles]
  sec: 687
  time: '11:27'
  who: Loïc
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah. Life is interesting, right? You never know. You graduate
    from school and you have no idea what you''ll do in 10 years, because it''s really
    difficult to know. [Loïc agrees] Parents say, “Become a civil engineer because
    it''s a well-paid job.” Then you go there, you study, only to find out that you
    like other things more. But it''s a journey. Right?'
  sec: 837
  time: '13:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Sometimes when you look for a new job or you are in the interviewing
    process, you always have this classical HR question coming in, “Where do you see
    yourself five years down the line? Ten years down the line?
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Loïc
- line: I wish I knew. [chuckles]
  sec: 877
  time: '14:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: I wish I knew. [chuckles] My discipline did not really exist 10 years ago
    – I assumed I was destined to be a civil engineer. So who knows? [laughs]
  sec: 878
  time: '14:38'
  who: Loïc
- header: Challenges in the transition to data engineering
- line: For you, what was the most difficult part when you did the transition? I'm
    guessing that as a civil engineer, you did not study software engineering and
    you needed to invest a lot of time in learning all these data engineering fundamentals.
    [Loïc agrees] Apart from that, what were the most significant challenges that
    you faced there and how did you overcome them?
  sec: 891
  time: '14:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The thing is, during the last decade, a lot of things happened in the
    data space. As you know, IoT became a thing – it produced a lot of data. I was
    in the IoT/civil engineering industry, so I can testify to that. Of course, you
    had the classical business intelligence practice, which was somewhat well-established
    – people doing the SSIS packages, building data pipelines, databases, reporting
    about the profitability margin, whatever.
  sec: 919
  time: '15:19'
  who: Loïc
- line: SSIS is this tool from Microsoft, this is the integration service where you
    drag and drop things – you connect different squares with the mouse, and then
    this thing somehow works at the end. Right?
  sec: 957
  time: '15:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Somehow it works, because you do your high-level data pipeline in a sort of
    “low code/no code fashion,” but then you still need to call stop procedures, and
    you still need to build those SQL, TSQL – you need to do that anyway. You just
    have a nice interface to architect your code somehow. Yeah, it's built into the...
  sec: 969
  time: '16:09'
  who: Loïc
- line: It's been a while since I saw this thing.
  sec: 994
  time: '16:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's been a while for me as well. Right now, it's Data Factory, Airflow,
    whatever – those things are basically SSIS legacy. So we have these these days,
    and everything is cloud-based. So yeah, the IoT, the volume of data, the fact
    that cloud was somewhat booming as well – if I remember, the transition happened
    around 2010 for us. I'm sure if you Google something like “Azure adoption graphs,”
    or whatever, you will probably see a big spike in 2017–2020 – this is when a lot
    of companies just shifted to the cloud – this happened. In addition to the big
    volume of data, this became somewhat of a new Wild West, because you want those
    new cloud services and a lot of data to deal with.
  sec: 997
  time: '16:37'
  who: Loïc
- line: Your classic documentation or resources, like “How to build an SSIS package
    (or whatever),” was not really relevant anymore. You had to find all the communities
    and so on. This was a challenge, actually – to transition from a place where the
    volume is increasing and people are shifting from cloud to cloud. You arrive into
    this new space where you have everything to rebuild somehow, but you have the
    good practices and concepts, and you need to have some basics, if I may. The best
    thing to overcome this challenge was to just keep yourself updated on how people
    do things – usually, Stack Overflow was filled with questions about people having
    problems with those new technologies (with those new services). A lot of communities
    have been built around those platforms. Or in my case, I took a few notes, just
    to make sure I didn't forget anything. I tried a lot of scripting languages –
    I ended up using Python because it was the most used in the industry. I didn't
    think more about it than that, “It's being used, I'm gonna use this. Okay.” Same
    for the cloud.
  sec: 997
  time: '16:37'
  who: Loïc
- line: You had AWS at the time – Google Cloud was somewhat there and Azure was just
    investing a lot in it. My company was using Azure Cloud, of course. In a lot of
    job postings, they were recruiting people using Python and cloud. For me, it was
    a very data-driven and practical choice to just go for it. But in the end, as
    a feedback, all the clouds are really more similar than dissimilar. What you will
    find in the platform will look mostly the same in another cloud provider. I would
    say not to focus on getting certifications to prove that you know the cloud or
    whatever. Because what's most important is to grasp the very strong basics of
    “What is a CRUD operation? What are the types of services you have access to store
    your data? What are your options to build? What are your tools available on this
    platform?” If you know that you need a hammer to just insert a nail into a wood
    plank – you will find your wood plank, you will find your nail, you will find
    your hammer in this new platform. No worries. This is what I would advise.
  sec: 997
  time: '16:37'
  who: Loïc
- line: That's advice you share as a data manager right now? I mean, as a data engineering
    manager – because you're hiring data engineers currently, right?
  sec: 1248
  time: '20:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Say it again?
  sec: 1256
  time: '20:56'
  who: Loïc
- line: Do you hire data engineers currently at your current role?
  sec: 1257
  time: '20:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I actually have one data engineer who has more experience than myself
    on a lot of the BI and data architecture side of things. But still, when it comes
    to Big Data and using Spark and new platforms like Databricks and whatever, there
    is still a transition to do. When I hired [people], the interview was basically
    more focused on, “Do you have some skills about doing data pipeline projects?”
    and “Tell me how it's going to go wrong. And what did you do?” and somewhat challenging
    strong opinions on good practices vs reality, etc. So when I hire for a data engineering
    role, I don't look for the perfect certifications – I look for experience, and
    I look for the scale of the projects people have been working on, the scale of
    the teams that they have been working on, and the general attitude towards solving
    the problem with the tools you have. If people are afraid, for example, when I
    say “Yeah, we are on Azure Cloud,” if they are afraid or they are like, “I only
    know AWS,” for me, it's somewhat of a red flag, because I would prefer an answer
    like, “The clouds are more similar than dissimilar. I know AWS, but I will adapt.”
    This is just about the mindset of answering the question more than the answer
    itself.
  sec: 1261
  time: '21:01'
  who: Loïc
- header: What is a data architect?
- line: Okay. Fair enough. I just looked at the time and I see that we spent most
    of the time talking about data engineering – your transition from data manager
    to data engineer. But we also wanted to talk about your other transition – the
    transition you made from a data engineer to a data architect. Before we talk about
    the details of your transition, I was wondering what a data architect actually
    is. Who actually is a data architect? What do they do? What kind of responsibilities
    do they have?
  sec: 1367
  time: '22:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a very good question. Actually, I had a couple of students a
    few weeks ago interviewing me just on this particular question, because they had
    to fill a form about, “What is a data architect?” to have this new position in
    school. The first bit of the answer was that a data architect is not a junior
    position. You do not graduate as a data architect. This is a role that you acquire
    when you have been firmly walking into the different aisles of data management
    from end to end. This was the first bit – it's an experienced role, because you
    need to be aware that you need to architect the data from the data source to the
    staging area, to your data warehousing part, and then building datamarts for the
    people to consume the data.
  sec: 1401
  time: '23:21'
  who: Loïc
- line: At each stage, you need to understand, for example, how the data is being
    produced and how the data is being consumed. Most of the time, there are automated
    systems like IoT producing data. In that case, it's actually the easiest part
    of data engineering. But when there are people producing data. You need to understand
    the processes. Then, when there are people consuming the data, you also need to
    understand the use case and what the final result of the analysis is and how they
    are binding the data and so on. I think the data architect role is about bridging
    the gap between the ETL CRUD operations (very technical) and the people using
    the data (producing and consuming it). There are a lot of definitions of data
    architect, but what is important is that it's not a junior position – you need
    to have experience on the full chain – and that you need to focus on the processes
    and the people and the use cases of the data more than the technical side of things.
    That will be the two main points, I would say, that describe a data architect.
  sec: 1401
  time: '23:21'
  who: Loïc
- line: You need to know about modeling of the data, because people are going to use
    the data that you have somehow created (pre-prepared) for them, so you need to
    make sure that your technical process of extracting, collecting, managing, and
    modeling data matches – that it's good technically, but it's also good business-wise.
  sec: 1401
  time: '23:21'
  who: Loïc
- line: Okay, so it's about bridging the gap, as you said, between the requirements
    and the implementation, right?
  sec: 1571
  time: '26:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Yeah.
  sec: 1579
  time: '26:19'
  who: Loïc
- header: The output of a data architect's work
- line: And for that, you need to understand the processes, use cases, what the final
    results should be, more or less. It's a very technical role, so you need to have
    experience doing things end-to-end – from source staging, warehousing, datamart
    – all these things need to make sense. Finally, you mentioned that you need to
    have a good understanding of modeling data. [Loïc agrees] How exactly the data
    looks like in the staging area, how exactly the data looks in the warehouse, how
    the data looks like in the datamart. But at the end of the day...
  sec: 1581
  time: '26:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay, you spent a lot of time talking to different stakeholders, you spent
    a lot of time talking to engineers who are going to implement that, but what is
    it that you do? What is the main, let's say, outcome? Is it a document that describes
    that, “At this step, you do that,” there are some diagrams with arrows showing
    how the data flows or is it something else?
  sec: 1581
  time: '26:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. What is the output of my work? The most important thing is, I would
    say, team alignment. Because when you have a data project, it's not only one team,
    creating the data, managing it, saving it, analyzing it – this would be the perfect
    scenario, of course. But usually, you have a team that is creating data, another
    team analyzing the data, and another team processing the data. The outcome of
    good data architecture, I would say, is that that process is optimized, of course,
    but this is only the technical part. The most important output of a data architect
    is team alignment, when it comes to producing data in a way that is usable by
    the pipeline, and storing the data in a way that is then usable for the business.
  sec: 1640
  time: '27:20'
  who: Loïc
- line: Of course, you will have a lot of tools to help you do this. Most of the time,
    as I showed in the previous talk, it looks like a massive bowl of spaghetti, with
    all of your data processes and all the flows of data from A to B to C etc. But
    these are only tools – the most important outcome is to have the alignment of
    the teams that are producing, extracting, transforming, and consuming data. This
    is the number one output of a data architect, I would say – making sure it's smooth.
  sec: 1640
  time: '27:20'
  who: Loïc
- line: I guess, in order to have this alignment, there needs to be some documentation.
    There needs to be some written piece or something like this “bowl of spaghetti”
    diagram, as you said. There should be something... Not physical, but something
    in your documentation that describes “Okay, these are the requirements. These
    are the limitations. These are the stakeholders. These are the users. These are
    the requirements and this is how you will want to implement this.” And all these
    teams, like the team that creates data, the team that processes data, the team
    that analyzes data, all have access to this document and they say, “Okay, this
    is what we want and need.” Right?
  sec: 1743
  time: '29:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Usually, if you have a dream project where you live in theory land...
  sec: 1788
  time: '29:48'
  who: Loïc
- line: Dream project, okay. [chuckles]
  sec: 1795
  time: '29:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is the perfect thing to do. You can spend a lot of time doing a really
    detailed a specification about all the processes, “It will go like this – from
    this source, connected with this protocol, you will get the data and you will
    store it in this way, into these tables, and that way, with those columns, and
    blah, blah, blah.” But reality has shown that whatever you plan, don't plan in
    too much detail, because a lot of things are going to derail you from your plans.
    The most important thing is to have common good practices and concepts, like “What
    is the quality level of data expected to arrive at the bronze level? You can't
    accept a lot of null values or things like this. And then if you ingest for the
    first time, you realize with a quick analysis that, “This is garbage.” You probably
    have a data process to improve, like the way people are entering data in forms
    or whatever, so that they do not skip the question or they do not choose the default
    null value – whatever. You make sure that your application – your UI or whatever
    – helps you to make all the data [inaudible].
  sec: 1796
  time: '29:56'
  who: Loïc
- line: So this is more about common sense and good practices. Make sure you have
    good data arriving at your bronze level and then understand how people are going
    to use it so that you say, “Okay, you will need to analyze those analytical metrics.”
    You want to analyze data stores, for example. You have the name of the store,
    the region where it is located, the period where the sales happened, the margin
    of the sales, and so on. All of this gives you your dimensions of analysis, like
    geography, time, stores, the article (the thing you are selling, for example).
    Then you have your metrics, which are the turnover, margin, number of sales –
    you need to basically build... [cross-talk]
  sec: 1796
  time: '29:56'
  who: Loïc
- header: Establishing metrics and dimensions
- line: But stakeholders give you this information. They say, “Okay, we care about
    these things.” Right? At the end, when we analyze the data, “This is what we want
    to see in the dashboard. We want to see these kinds of metrics.”They tell you
    that and then you need to define, talk to other teams who create data, who analyze
    data and process data, and you work this out – you need to understand what kind
    of dimensions there are, what kind of metrics there are, all these bronze things
    you mentioned. Bronze is the staging area, right? Or what is that?
  sec: 1946
  time: '32:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, bronze is the very raw data, and then you have silver and gold. What
    you are discussing with the stakeholders, who are going to consume the data, is
    more like, “What should the gold layer look like so I can analyze it?” And then
    what you are discussing with the people that are producing data, it's more about,
    “What should be the acceptable quality level that you can drop (dump) into the
    bronze layer.” Then, together with your data engineering team and the analysis
    team, you discuss, “Okay, I got this, I need that – how do I mix and match? How
    do I bind it? How do I transform it so it's the appropriate level of quality for
    my analysis?” So the most important thing is that you need to discuss that with
    people.
  sec: 1978
  time: '32:58'
  who: Loïc
- line: Generally, stakeholders don't say, “I have an analytical dimension that is
    the geography and I have a metric that is my turnover.” Never. Okay, maybe with
    very lucky people you will have those discussions. [chuckles] But usually it goes
    like, “I need to analyze the margin in this region.” Nowhere in the sentence,
    “I need to analyze the margin in this region of the world.” Nowhere in the sentence
    did they mention the dimensions and the metrics. You need to discuss and say,
    “Okay, your metric is the margin and your dimension is the geography.” Maybe for
    this analysis, if I manage to store my data in the proper way, you could be able
    to scale this analysis and have your margin in all the regions of the world. So
    your analysis is not only for this area that you want right now – this is your
    quick win, what you need to output to your CEO for next week – but maybe what
    you want is a more scalable process to be able to reproduce your analysis very
    quickly for another region, at another time, whatever.
  sec: 1978
  time: '32:58'
  who: Loïc
- line: This is the kind of discussion you have with your stakeholders, just to make
    sure that you are going to store the data in the proper way. You will have your
    facts table and then you will have your geographical dimension and your store
    dimension and your article dimension – and your fact table will have all of those
    columns and help you to build those metrics and so on. This is where the technical
    side kicks in, but the role of the data architect is really understanding what
    to build and why. This is the key role.
  sec: 1978
  time: '32:58'
  who: Loïc
- line: How exactly they will use it once it's built – what kind of questions they
    want to have answers for. Right? What kind of analysis, how exactly they will
    use it, and also maybe what sort of decisions they will make based on whatever
    they want. Right?
  sec: 2143
  time: '35:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. Usually what happens in a company is you have different departments
    – in our case, for example, we will have Supply Chain, Finance and Sales – they
    will also analyze the quantity of stock we have left, but for very different reasons.
    And you will end up building a report for the sales, another for the finance,
    another for the supply chain – but still, the data that you use at the origin
    is the same for all of them.
  sec: 2160
  time: '36:00'
  who: Loïc
- line: As a data architect, you need to also be aware of this so that you can put
    together all of those developments to build a sort of core model or some foundation
    to build all of those different use cases. So it's not only from source to consumer,
    but you also will have a lot of consumers and there is another dimension that
    is the transversal dimension of the work, if that makes sense.

- header: The importance of communication
- line: To me, it sounds like this work mostly involves communication, right? You
    need to, first of all, speak with stakeholders, understand what the requirements
    are, how it's going to be used, and then you need to spend a lot of time talking
    to teams, to understand maybe what is the current status, how this can be implemented.
    Then you need to come up with this design document, to make sure that all these
    teams are aligned. Right?
  sec: 2230
  time: '37:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: So would do you say that as a data architect, you spend most of your time
    talking with other people? Or what's the breakdown? What exactly does it look
    like? What do you say it's 80% communication, 12% documentation writing – do you
    do any hands-on stuff? What does a typical day look like?
  sec: 2230
  time: '37:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: It really depends on your company. If I talk for myself, the previous year
    has been really focused on the technical side of things. I was mostly hands-on,
    somehow building the platform with the rest of the team – making sure all that
    was flowing from the sources to the data lakehouse. Right now, we are in the process
    where the team knows how to do all of this – we have a common set of practices.
    The next stage is to finally have time to discuss with the stakeholders about
    what it is that they need and build a better gold layer, I would say – focus on
    the gold layer of the data warehouse. So bronze and silver are solved, and now
    we are focusing on the gold. The role has been shifting from something like 80%
    of dealing with technical people and maybe 20% of dealing with stakeholders, to
    the actual opposite where, once you have the data, you can just spend more time
    focusing on discussing what you want. So it's going to be 80% stakeholder, 20%
    technical, for example.
  sec: 2277
  time: '37:57'
  who: Loïc
- line: So it really depends on the phase of the project where you are, I would say.
    But my advice is that stakeholders really want to see that you are progressing
    on the project – on the data they want. So you should focus more on the stakeholders.
    As a priority, you should focus more on stakeholder management than your team
    management once the good practices have been set up and agreed within your team.
    So the first thing is to agree on the good practices, build an end-to-end use
    case, say, “Okay, this is how we do this. This is all standard.” And then you
    can free time for yourself to deal with the stakeholders. Right now this is where
    I'm moving into, if I talk for myself.
  sec: 2277
  time: '37:57'
  who: Loïc
- line: From what I understood of what you said, what you do is quite a technical
    role. So you are still pretty hands-on with building things with the rest of the
    team. But still, there is this component of talking with stakeholders, and it's
    your job as a data architect to actually inform them on what the progress is,
    which stage it is currently in, and of course, if there are any questions (if
    something is not clear) it's your job to approach the stakeholders and clarify
    the requirements.
  sec: 2418
  time: '40:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, “When you said that you need to analyze margins in some regions
    of the world, did you mean on the country level or did you maybe mean county level?”
    So you need to go to them and ask that. Right?
  sec: 2418
  time: '40:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I don't believe that if... I am present in all the meetings where we
    specify things the data team can scale, basically. So the transition is about
    somehow empowering your team so that once they know the good practices and how
    to do things, that they do it for themselves – the data analyst going to the business,
    discussing what they need, and then discussing with the data engineer. The data
    engineering parties are going to know how to do things in an optimized fashion,
    and then at least are going to know what the  business requires.
  sec: 2467
  time: '41:07'
  who: Loïc
- line: I think that part of the role of a data architect is to help both with practices
    and to communicate well together – to make sure that the communication is smooth
    between the data engineer and the data analyst. Also, that the communication is
    smooth between the data analyst and the stakeholders. The end goal looks more
    like auditor/data product manager, if I use “techie” terms.
  sec: 2467

  who: Loïc
- header: Setting up best practices for the team
- line: So it looks like you want to teach people how to speak, so you can kind of
    get out of the team – so that they work without you. Right? What I mean by this
    is, if you're involved in everything, then you become the bottleneck and nothing
    is moving. So what you want to do is set up these best practices so that they
    know how to talk, who to talk to, and when to talk to them. Then, you can step
    away and watch this thing work without your participation. Right?
  sec: 2551
  time: '42:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Stepping away and just watching it go. It's a new level, when you know
    what the company is going to look like in three months, six months, whatever.
    You need to make sure that the effort of your teams, in terms of priority, that
    the time they are spending doing things is aligned with the short-, mid-, and
    long-term objectives of your company. I think this is also a part of the data
    product manager or data architect role, depending on the size or the topology
    of your team. But the most important thing is that you know how to do technical
    things, you make sure the communication is smooth, and then that you empower your
    teams so that they know how to do things individually so you can transversely
    scale your work. Then you can just focus on prioritizing the work of the team
    so that it aligns with the company's objectives. Does that make sense?

- header: Staying relevant and tech-watching
- line: I see a question about handling – how you adapt and stay relevant in the field.
    In my experience – so I was kind of also working in an architectural role, even
    though it wasn't related to data engineering, it was related more to machine learning,
    but that doesn't matter. What I noticed is that the more I spend time working
    with stakeholders, communicating, and aligning teams, the less time I have on
    the coding side (on the technical side). What happened is, after half a year of
    me doing this thing, I became very not hands-on. I stopped coding.
  sec: 2653
  time: '44:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: I spoke with other people that work as principal engineers, or architects
    – all of them confirmed that they went through something similar. It was a similar
    process, where they started doing more high-level stuff and with time, they became
    less hands-on. With time, new tools come out – DBT exists now and it's very popular
    (five years ago, it wasn't there) and, if your data engineering experience comes
    from five years ago, you might not even know how to use DBT. You just know that
    it exists.
  sec: 2653
  time: '44:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's the same with machine learning – these new tools keep appearing, there's
    some buzz about them, but if you lose touch with the ground (if you become too
    high level) you risk becoming irrelevant. You risk forgetting things. So how do
    you do that? In your case, you said you still try to be hands-on, but my question
    is – how do you find time to do all that?
  sec: 2653
  time: '44:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's actually very funny that you mentioned DBT, actually, because this is
    exactly what is happening to the data stack in the data team and myself At MyLight.
    We are working on this gold data level, and I have this new data engineer in the
    team, who is a very good individual contributor – this is what he likes and is
    meant to do. So, speaking about DBT – he comes from a very SQL-based background
    and the data stack we had was not really manageable in terms of the gold level.
    DBT is perfect for this area, where it's automatically building your asset diagram,
    and your pipeline, and scheduling everything for you, and so on. But, as I was
    spending a lot of time doing specifications or stakeholder management, I couldn't
    install DBT myself – set up the pipeline, build all of those Jinja routines, and
    so on, etc.
  sec: 2757
  time: '45:57'
  who: Loïc
- line: Actually, I did not touch DBT at all. The data engineer was the only one dealing
    with this. But we were doing one-on-ones – every week, I have 30-minute meetings
    with all the team members. And during those one-on-ones, there is, of course,
    the synchronization of the work that has been done, etc., etc. But part of it
    was, “Okay. Tell me what you have done and go into detail, because I want to see
    what you did and I want to understand it.” Of course, you have other high level
    things to do, but those one-on-ones, when you are managing a team of very technical
    individual contributors – they are your perfect occasions to stay relevant on
    the technologies or tools that you are implementing on your data stack, for example.
    This is the first place where you learn, ask questions, try to show your screen,
    you show the code, you show how it works, you run the pipeline end-to-end, etc.,
    etc. Of course, you are not doing it hands-on, but you know that if some shit
    happens, basically, that you will be able to be a second set of eyes on the work
    of the person, and be able to debug the pipeline together or whatever.
  sec: 2757
  time: '45:57'
  who: Loïc
- line: You can also help the team on getting good practice with new tools, even though
    you have not implemented them yourself – you just share the knowledge about what
    you did in the past, what works and what doesn't, so the team is then somehow
    empowered as we said and just make the decision for themselves.  But this is a
    very good way to stay up to date and relevant – those one-on-ones with your individual
    technical contributors. The second thing is to stay up to date – you read blogs,
    you subscribe to very good seminars and podcasts, like DataTalks or any other
    that you like (that is in your field).
  sec: 2757
  time: '45:57'
  who: Loïc
- line: Stay up to date by watching webinars, and when you have something that sparks
    your attention or excitement, you maybe spend a couple of hours during your workweek
    or your evening just trying to make it work for a little project or some part
    of your project, as a proof of concept. Build a proof of concept that works, that
    will include this new technology, and see if it's worth it. If it's not working
    – good. You have the hands-on experience now (maybe) and you tried it, you benchmarked
    it, and it was no good. But for you, there's the next thing. At least you are
    aware of what is there and how to use it.
  sec: 2757
  time: '45:57'
  who: Loïc
- line: Basically, if I tried to summarize what you said, it's to look at trends –
    what exactly is hot and what people are talking about. Secondly, try to squeeze
    in some time in your week (in your calendar) to find out where you can actually
    get some of these tools that people talk about and then implement some sort of
    proof of concept. Right?
  sec: 3023
  time: '50:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, “technology watching”. This is the term. Create yourself a community
    on LinkedIn so you can be aware of [these technologies]. Find an expert about
    Power BI, find an expert about data engineering, find a newsletter about data
    science, find a DataTalks [podcast] about machine learning – whatever. Just add
    a lot of streams of input so that you can keep aware of the trends, of the new
    things. Have a lot – not only one – have a lot of them so you can see things that
    are repeating and you can see the trends. You see, “Okay, this one talked about
    this technology – DBT DBT, DBT.” If everybody's talking about DBT, you should
    be trying it – otherwise, you are missing out on an industry trend, which could
    be bad for you in the long run.

    now I have no idea how it works. It feels like all the data scientists know what

    It's the same with DBT, though – it's similar.

    the hype of GPT. Good for them. But I think we are in a very busy world. At some
    point, you will find the time to just take a deep breath, go out of the water,
    and just have a look at this GPT thing. By then, everything will have somehow
    consolidated – this is good GPT stuff, this is bad GPT stuff, this is half-good
    GPT stuff, or whatever. And you will have more insights than just trying everything
    straight away as it comes out. You will lose a lot of energy if you focus on GPT
    right now. Just know what you can do, keep thinking about what it can do and at
    some point, just consolidate everything – do a deep dive at that time, I guess,
    when it's somewhat mature. At the speed at which things are moving these days,
    its maturity is a very obsolete concept. [chuckles]

  sec: 3238
  time: '53:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's really complicated. I touched on this a bit earlier, but the only way
    to escape the fact that you can't clone yourself, or you can't work 48 hours a
    day is to scale your knowledge by giving it to your team. Then, you can do a bit
    of both. Once the work you have done in terms of specifications is mature enough,
    introduce a data analyst and a data engineer and then start the work.
  sec: 3239
  time: '53:59'
  who: Loïc
- line: So first the specs and then pipeline? I guess it's a draft of the specs, right?
    You don't want to have a super-detailed specification where everything is perfect,
    but when you try to implement it, nothing works. Right?
  sec: 3276
  time: '54:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well this does not work if you do a waterfall project, where you do a technical
    design – a detailed technical specification and so on – and what you will build
    will not be relevant when you will have built it. So just try to sketch end-to-end
    what it should look like, try to get the customers' feedback (your stakeholders'
    feedback) as soon as possible so you know if you've been doing something wrong
    and you have some insights from the domain experts. They will tell you, “Yeah,
    but look at this. The turnover is not good at all on this. You should not take
    into account those kinds of articles because they’re transportation costs. This
    is nothing that we include in the codes that we send to our clients.”
  sec: 3291
  time: '54:51'
  who: Loïc
- line: Anyway, you can get those domain insights and expertise knowledge very fast
    if you just quickly draft end-to-end and then you refine it with them, you bring
    more data, you specify, and you iterate (this is the most important concept).
    We are, I think, in a world that is... I don't know if it's largely agile, but
    in the tech industry, at least, we push those agility concepts more and more.
    Do not over-specify and do not over-optimize your code, when you are doing things
    straight away, but do try to get your clients' feedback straight away so you can
    iterate really quickly and get the 80% of the results in the fastest way possible.

- line: In summary, you draft an end-to-end specification (very drafty), you get feedback
    on that, then you incorporate the feedback, and implement a POC pipeline. Then
    you get feedback again because this POC probably produces something – get feedback,
    incorporate that, perhaps, into the specification (adapt the specification), change
    the POC and repeat. Right? At some point, the POC becomes a proper project where
    you fix all the technical debt. But this shouldn't happen immediately, right?
  sec: 3399
  time: '56:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Usually, this is a trap. You're going to build a book, and you will
    end up with a lot of technical debt, and a big impact on your code so you can
    make it scalable. If you have previously built projects, you have some kinds of
    templates on how to do things, like an ingestion template, a transformation template,
    a creation of datamarts template, Power BI templates with the appropriate colors
    and whatever. Make sure you template things that have shown results at scale in
    other areas of your projects. On other projects, make sure you reuse what you
    know how to do, because then you just gonna go fast.
  sec: 3432

    – boom. API? Okay. API ingestion function – I get it straight into bronze, merge
    into silver. Then, okay, they need geographical dimension? Okay, I know that I
    have my postal code or my country database somewhere – I'm just going to reuse
    this for the proof of concept. Then, as you are reusing bits and pieces that you've
    built in previous projects, these are the things that are already used in production
    by other projects, so you have a basis of elements that are reusable. You go from
    proof of concept, which is somehow already scalable, and modulate the differences
    and the specificities of your proof of concept. But you will go fast into the
    ingestion phase if you reuse templates. Build templates!
  sec: 3432

  who: Loïc
- line: So it's also part of your job as a data architect to know which templates
    are already there (which templates exist), which templates you need to build,
    update, etc., right? You need to think about the things you've built in terms
    of templates, like, “Okay, like I see multiple projects and this thing here kind
    of repeats. There's some redundancy, so let's make a template out of this.” [Loïc
    agrees] As a Data Architect, you need to watch out for this. You need to look
    for this.
  sec: 3537
  time: '58:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, you need to be aware of templates. You have your data engineering hat,
    where you know that you have this somewhat software engineering side of you that
    tells you, “Okay, if I'm repeating something three times, I may want to build
    something common for that, which I'm going to reuse. Ingest from bronze? This
    is my function. I will put it somewhere and then I will use it in this project,
    in this project, in this project. I will call the same codebase that I will reuse
    into the different projects.” The data architect and the data engineer and the
    software engineer side of the personality that you are should be aware that you
    can't build the perfect generic function to solve it all. Otherwise, we'd be out
    of work a long time ago. But you need to balance what is generic and reusable
    and scalable with what is specific to every project. You can't build a key that
    is going to open all of the doors in the world, but 80% of the doors is already
    good enough. We'll open the remaining 20% with my specific keys that we will build.
