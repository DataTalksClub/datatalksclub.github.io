transcript:
- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: Episode kickoff and guest reintroduction
- line: This week, we'll talk about the role of a staff AI engineer. We have a special
    guest today, Tatiana. Tatiana works as a staff AI engineer at LinkedIn. Before
    that, she worked in physics and in health care. It's actually not the first time
    Tatiana is a guest here on this podcast – around two years ago, we already talked
    with her. The topic there was changing careers from academia (from physics) to
    machine learning. Now, after two years, we have Tatiana on again, and we will
    talk about the staff role. Welcome, again.
  sec: 71
  time: '1:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. Thank you for inviting me.
  sec: 110
  time: '1:50'
  who: Tatiana
- header: 'Guest background: physics → healthcare → machine learning'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of being a staff engineer, let's start with
    your background. We already spoke about your background years ago, but maybe you
    can run us through it again, and also tell us what happened in the last few years.
  sec: 113
  time: '1:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I started my career with a PhD in physics, and I worked for a while
    developing lasers and optical systems. Then, during maternity leave, I got quite
    interested in the machine learning field, which was new back then, so I started
    doing pet projects and Kaggle and doing my own research and publishing papers
    in machine learning. After maternity leave, I moved to healthcare, where I was
    working on a computer-aided diagnostic tool for labor monitoring. At that point,
    we talked almost two years ago.
  sec: 129
  time: '2:09'
  who: Tatiana
- line: After one year of working in a hospital, I started to go to interviews at
    different companies, big tech companies, different startups, remote works, and
    so on. I started to work as a tech lead at LinkedIn, after some difficult choices,
    where I have worked for the last year and a half. That's been pretty much all
    the news for the last two years, but I learned a ton because it's a new industry
    and new environment.
  sec: 129
  time: '2:09'
  who: Tatiana
- line: That was pretty concise. [chuckles]
  sec: 195
  time: '3:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I try. [laughs]
  sec: 199
  time: '3:19'
  who: Tatiana
- header: Onboarding shock at LinkedIn and industry mindset shift
- line: I'm just curious – it’s probably two different worlds, or even three different
    worlds – academia, then working at a hospital, and now working at a big tech company.
    All three are very different. [Tatiana agrees] How was it for you going from working
    in a hospital to joining LinkedIn, a big tech company? How was it for you? Overwhelming,
    I guess?
  sec: 204
  time: '3:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'It was transformational. It was overwhelming. In the first three months of
    onboarding, I was working about 80 hours, 70-80 hours a week. Big kudos to my
    husband, who understood that I needed the time, so he was helping with the kids
    a lot when I was just studying in the evenings. Yes, it was a big challenge, but
    also a big shift was in the mindset. When you work in academia – also a hospital
    is quite close to academia – your timeline is a bit different. You plan projects
    for one-two years. You''re not in a hurry. You''re relaxed. You don''t have that
    many meetings. Therefore, you really learn a bunch of skills in academia: effective
    communication, working in a fast-paced environment, planning quarterly, and delivering
    results faster.'
  sec: 229
  time: '3:49'
  who: Tatiana
- line: What you do in academia –what you need to do in a year, you accomplish in
    three months and things like that. In academia people talk like they have all
    the time in the world. For one hour, you can have a meeting without that much
    outcome. In industry, you have 20 minutes of a meeting where you have to decide
    what you're going to do. Then the next 20 minute meetings, 30 minute meetings
    and so on. You learn a lot about collaboration, communication, prioritization,
    and so on. But that is really useful.
  sec: 229
  time: '3:49'
  who: Tatiana
- line: 80 hours a week? That's insane. Why did you need to put so much effort there?
    I guess, at the beginning, it was just too difficult and too overwhelming, so
    you needed to put extra effort into catching up with everything?
  sec: 319
  time: '5:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think yes. Well, it's not that I always worked 80 hours a week. It's not.
    [cross-talk]
  sec: 334
  time: '5:34'
  who: Tatiana
- line: At the beginning, you had to, right?
  sec: 339
  time: '5:39'
  who: Alexey
- header: Ramping up technical stack as a tech lead (Scala, Spark, Kubernetes)
- line: At the beginning, I came and I realized, “Oh! Okay. Scala, Spark. I never
    thought about that. Kubernetes?” A lot of internal tools that I never used, and
    you’re also a tech lead, so you actually don't have that much of an onboarding
    or a relaxed onboarding. You're a tech lead and you actually lead others. You
    already need to deliver some design of the new system at scale that you never
    delivered at this scale. For example, a recommendation system for 80 million users
    – that's not something that I was doing before. But I was the tech lead, so all
    the decisions were on my side.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Tatiana
- line: To make those decisions, I had to learn a lot about how other companies do
    it, read a lot of blog posts, and papers as well. At the same time I was learning
    all those tools that I never used. I guess I was just overwhelmed, so I tried
    to do my best to catch up. If I had to do it a second time, I would tell myself
    to take it easy. They give you time. You're not supposed to deliver results in
    the first two months. It's okay. But I think I was so worried that I wouldn't
    be effective enough that I worked the extra mile. Now I know that I could have
    taken it easier and taken my time to learn.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Yeah, that's pretty interesting. I want to ask you more about the tools and
    how you approached this learning. But before that, I think it would be interesting
    to know what tech leads do – what staff engineers do. You mentioned that you need
    to lead others, you need to design systems, and you need to make decisions. What
    does your day look like? What kind of things do you need to do?
  sec: 424
  time: '7:04'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Staff AI Engineer role: opinion, strategy, and cross-functional influence'
- line: In short, I'll say it like this – I'm paid for my opinion. That's in short.
    In detail, as a staff engineer – there are different kinds of staff engineers.
    Specifically, our team is a horizontal team. This means that we have a lot of
    internal stakeholders in different orgs. That means a lot of interactions with
    different teams, with products, with data scientists, with other teams, with annotators,
    with the legal team, and so on. Almost half of my work is different meetings and
    interactions. You are analyzing strategy, you're defining a roadmap for a set
    of projects, you agree with other leaders and align on different cross-functional
    collaborations, different projects.
  sec: 450
  time: '7:30'
  who: Tatiana
- line: You also own the delivery of the results and their impact. A lot of work goes
    into those meetings on alignment and defining the roadmap and strategy and what
    you're gonna do and defining the objective – both business and technical goals,
    basically. You collaborate with products a lot on that. On the technical side,
    you also mentor a lot of people – not only in your immediate team, but across
    different teams as well. You work with ML engineers, annotators, engineer linguists,
    data scientists, UI engineers – and you supervise them all to make sure that the
    project is delivered on time. You are part of promo committees and hiring committees,
    where you review the work of others. As technical AI staff, you do a lot of machine
    learning design. Obviously, if you're staff in some other area, like infrastructure,
    you probably work on system design more.
  sec: 450
  time: '7:30'
  who: Tatiana
- line: A lot of work is dedicated to creating designs and also reviewing designs
    of others. When people create some designs, that has to be reviewed, and often
    staff is the person who is brought in to give their opinion. You also do a lot
    of code reviews. People who work with you write code and you review it for your
    team, and also outside your team. You don't write much of the code. I still try
    to keep hands-on. I dedicate one day a week for myself to write code. That's my
    choice, basically. But most of the time, you don't really write the code.
  sec: 450
  time: '7:30'
  who: Tatiana
- line: There are some staff engineers who don't write any code and there are some
    staff engineers who write more code – it depends on what kind of staff you are,
    as well. As for me, I write a lot of docs, obviously, and a lot of plans and roadmaps.
    Everything needs a doc. If you have a legal alignment, for example, you need to
    document it – and things like that. That's pretty much all the pillars. So design
    and systems, mentoring others, giving your opinion, improving craftsmanship of
    the team and outside the team, defining strategy, defining roadmaps, and making
    sure that the bigger projects involving many teams go to production and that they
    make an impact.
  sec: 450
  time: '7:30'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Quite a lot for one person, isn't it?
  sec: 660
  time: '11:00'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Staff engineer archetypes: deep specialist, cross-team advisor, hands-on
    mentor'
- line: Well, you’re more leading that. So you don't do all that yourself. People
    who implement things work with you and you collaborate with products as well,
    who define what business impact to expect and things like that. And you collaborate
    with the legal team, which advises you on what you can and cannot do. Things like
    this. But yes, it's a lot of coordination and meetings. On a weekly basis, you
    can meet like 5 to 10 different teams and with different people. Again, this is
    cross-team collaboration type of stuff – when you have a lot of cross-team collaborations.
    That's my role.
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Tatiana
- line: There are also different types of staff. For example, there are people who
    have very great technical expertise and they know some particular narrow field
    very well (not necessarily “narrow”). They're pulled into troubleshooting. If
    there is a critical problem, and something doesn't work, they're pulled in to
    solve the problem, like “firefighting”. So there are these kinds of staff. There
    are people who have great depths and widths in a particular field, for example,
    machine learning. They act as advisors to the leadership. They're like personal
    advisors on the technical side. There are also these kinds of staff.
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Tatiana
- line: So there are people who have very great expertise compared to others, so they
    mentor and teach others this expertise and focus more on hands-on. They create
    a lot of leverage by actually coding. But that's not very common, usually all
    the staff don’t do a lot of coding. It depends on the role. If you're a horizontal
    team and you have a lot of different interactions, you're not paid for coding
    – you're more paid for your opinion and making decisions and realizing and all
    this and defining roadmaps. However, I'm still trying to be involved in coding
    myself, not only reviewing. But most of the code I don't write – I review it.
    It’s like one to ten – for each submission that I do, I review ten. Something
    like that.
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Just to summarize what you said – there are multiple kinds of staff engineers
    (staff-level people) or profiles, I think I've also heard the word “archetypes”.
    [Tatiana agrees] What you do is collaboration and coordination work. Then there
    is somebody who has great, deep technical expertise. They are brought in when
    there is a problem in some specific area and they help solve it. And then there
    are people who have broad expertise and they act as advisors. Did I miss anything?
  sec: 804
  time: '13:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Broad and deep in a particular area, yes.
  sec: 843
  time: '14:03'
  who: Tatiana
- line: It’s one person, right? Deep in one and brought in others.
  sec: 849
  time: '14:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, there are people who manage to have both after a while. If you're 20 years
    in the field. [chuckles]
  sec: 853
  time: '14:13'
  who: Tatiana
- line: It's like this T shaped profile, right?
  sec: 860
  time: '14:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. There is a book – I think it's called Staff Engineer Path, which defines
    those archetypes quite well. I quite agree with the definitions that I read in
    the book.
  sec: 863
  time: '14:23'
  who: Tatiana
- header: Transferring academic skills to industry leadership and roadmapping
- line: Okay. So you're paid for your opinion. You spent 50% of your time in meetings.
    You work on strategy, defined roadmaps, and you also mentor people, and take part
    in design decisions. You mentioned that at the beginning, you needed to work something
    like 70-80 hours because I guess many of these things were difficult for you.
    You weren't certain that your design decisions were good, so you wanted to improve
    your skills. Did I understand that correctly?
  sec: 881
  time: '14:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Some of that was very well transferred from academia. For example, all
    this communication, collaboration, roadmap strategy – it's exactly how you define
    your research proposal. You write a plan for two years, you define goals, you
    loyalize different teams, and so on. Mentoring is a big part of academic work,
    so nothing changed there. But I did not work in NLP before and I did not work
    exactly with this type of recommendation systems at that scale. So that was a
    big part of learning. I took a couple of courses, both in NLP and recommendation
    systems. But I also read a lot in blog posts and in papers that other companies
    published.
  sec: 916
  time: '15:16'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Also, a big part of learning was internal tools. You can't learn them outside,
    pretty much. You can but it's not that common outside. You learn a lot of those
    internal tools. Plus, I didn't work with Scala and Spark before and with Kubernetes
    I did not work before. There were also some gaps, because I never worked as a
    software engineer. I probably had a little bit more gaps in the technical part,
    but a little bit fewer in the strategy and communication, thanks to academia.
  sec: 916
  time: '15:16'
  who: Tatiana
- line: How did you approach learning? How did you know what to learn next? Did you
    create a plan and follow this plan? Did you ask your colleagues for their advice?
    How did you do this?
  sec: 997
  time: '16:37'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Onboarding priorities: common mistakes and faster learning'
- line: My onboarding was rather hectic. I was just learning whatever I could without
    properly understanding what to prioritize. In the beginning, you're overwhelmed
    simply because you don't know what you need to prioritize and how. If I had to
    do it a second time, I would understand that better and I wouldn't require that
    much time. Basically, I was taking one course after the other without a clear
    understanding of what was more important at the very moment. I only got this understanding
    in about two-three months.
  sec: 1007
  time: '16:47'
  who: Tatiana
- line: That does sound very overwhelming – trying to learn everything at the same
    time, or at least one after another. If you could give a piece of advice to yourself
    in the past, what would it be? How would you suggest approaching this to yourself
    in the past?
  sec: 1043
  time: '17:23'
  who: Alexey
- header: Mentorship importance for onboarding and career growth
- line: Yes, that's a good question. Onboarding is always a challenge. And onboarding
    in big companies is definitely a challenge. So I would find more mentors from
    the start and just ask them to help with this technical plan. In fact, I had a
    mentor, but he immediately went on parental leave. That's why I didn't have a
    mentor and such during onboarding. Usually, in the onboarding process, you have
    a mentor who helps you and guides you. After that, we spent quite some time developing
    our onboarding for the next engineers, so they wouldn't be overwhelmed. Hopefully,
    that worked better. So that's number one – find mentors immediately and ask them
    to help. Also, communicate with your manager all the time about priorities and
    expectations. Don't feel the urge to deliver something in production in the first
    two months. It's okay – you have your time to onboard in a big tech company. Of
    course, if you're in a startup, you need to deliver by the end of the week. [chuckles]
  sec: 1065
  time: '17:45'
  who: Tatiana
- line: '[chuckles] No pressure, right?'
  sec: 1139
  time: '18:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m just kidding. But yes, the onboarding time depends on the size of the
    company.
  sec: 1143
  time: '19:03'
  who: Tatiana
- header: 'Skipping mid-level roles: landing a staff position from academia'
- line: Maybe startups don't really need these kinds of profiles? They don't need
    somebody who coordinates because if it's just one or two teams, then people can
    just talk to each other without this special role, probably. I know that you joined
    LinkedIn as a staff engineer after working in healthcare. You managed to skip
    like a few roles before staff. I know that their usual career progression is –
    you join a company as a junior, there are juniors, there are middle level professionals,
    then there are seniors, and then only after that staff engineers.
  sec: 1148
  time: '19:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: From what I understood, you didn't have experience in industry, yet you didn't
    join LinkedIn as a middle level engineer or a senior engineer – you joined immediately
    as a staff engineer. I’m wondering how this happened? How did you manage to kind
    of jump over these roles and land a pretty high level position?

- line: Yeah, I get this question a lot. The reason is that people think that whenever
    you just start a new career, you have to start at a junior level. This is not
    correct. It's not that I didn't have a career before. I actually had a PhD in
    physics and then I worked in science for six years, leading my own projects as
    a research fellow. When you're a principal investigator in science, what you do
    is the following – you come up with an idea for a project that nobody on Earth
    has ever done before. You need to find partners to make this happen.
  sec: 1216
  time: '20:16'
  who: Tatiana
- line: You need to find a host Institute who has enough equipment, a partner institute,
    industrial partners – ideally, five different organizations across the globe.
    You need to write a proposal when you put your implementation plan forward. You
    sell motivation – why you need to do that. You do budgeting. You do your strategy,
    your OKRs – your everything. And if you are in the top 9% of those who submitted
    proposals, you get money. If you don't, you're jobless. That's how it works in
    science. And that's what I was doing.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it's much more complicated compared to the situation in industry in this
    regard. I got like three successful grants in a row, which is quite good. To get
    three successes, you obviously need to have three or more failures as well. Not
    all of my proposals were successful. But they teach how you find collaborators,
    how to align with them, how to agree, how to write a plan, how to make a strategy,
    and so on. And then you lead those projects, so you hire PhD students, you mentor
    them, and you go through problems, because it's high-risk projects in science
    since nobody's done it before. You don't know if you can do it or not. Sometimes
    it leads to invention disclosures, some great papers, and sometimes – oops, it's
    not gonna work. This is also normal since it's very high-risk projects.
  sec: 1286

  who: Tatiana
- line: All that you can transfer – a lot of those skills are actually transferable,
    in terms of ownership, leadership, mentorship, strategy, roadmapping, and all
    that stuff. There are some things that you don't do. For instance, you don't program
    in Scala, but you program in FORTRAN or MATLAB. It's not exactly that, but not
    that much different. It's technical skills where you need to fill the gaps. But
    for technical skills, I'd say 6-12 months, you work yourself, you learn to get
    it. It's much harder to learn soft skills, in my opinion, and to uplevel your
    communication and collaboration. It's way harder than learning Python, for example,
    in my opinion. When you move to industry, it's important to put the right angle
    on all your previous experience and sell it in the right way. In the beginning,
    I was making mistakes when I was talking about lasers too much.
  sec: 1286
  time: '21:26'
  who: Tatiana
- line: At the end, I stopped talking about lasers at all – I was talking about what
    I was doing in terms of collaboration, alignment, delivery, and so on. You could
    see straight away how it aligns well with the staff role. What also helps – if
    you look at the tech lead, lead role, staff role in the organization, in terms
    of the descriptions and expectations, you see how your previous experience aligns
    with what’s in the docs. The docs are quite possible to find. Although it's not
    typical to have a career change like mine, I'm not the only one like that. I know
    a bunch of people who were in academia and/or healthcare, like my mentor who worked
    in the hospital, who was leading me during my internship. He moved to Qualcomm
    straight as a staff engineer. Now he is currently a director. Then my manager
    at LinkedIn, she also moved from academia to LinkedIn, straight to the staff position.
  sec: 1286
  time: '21:26'
  who: Tatiana
- line: It happens, it’s just not that common because not many people change the area.
    If you're a really great scientist, you actually can start as a distinguished.
    If you have this level of expertise, like a highly recognized scientist in academia,
    you can move to the highest level. That also happens. Not very common, but it
    happens. The other option is – some people do a PhD, for instance, and they do
    a startup. Then if the startup is acquired by a big company, they can start at
    a high level. I know an example, when Lyft acquired a startup and that startup
    CEO started as a director. So he joined the industry at the director level. It's
    not that you have to start as a mid-level or junior every time. If you already
    had some career growth and you have experience, it just depends which role you
    can fit most of your transferable skills to.

    you have to start from a junior. You need to sell yourself in the right way. I
    have two follow-up questions here. Maybe first, okay, yes – you need to sell yourself.
    But how do you convince them to actually trust you?
  sec: 1530

    academia to the industry? At the beginning, you also said that they’re very different
    environments. So how do you convince your employer that the skills you got in
    that environment are transferable to this new environment? Because they're pretty
    different.
  sec: 1530
  time: '25:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, true. However, it also depends on the angle. In the beginning, I wasn't
    quite successful with that. In fact, in the first interviews, I was failing. But
    then, after some practice, I learned which angle to choose, how to present my
    projects. One of the ways is to focus on the research projects that you've done
    in partnership with industry, and I had some of those. If this was a partnership
    with industry, and you can say that, “Okay, we delivered an optical system for
    Alcon, who produces lenses, to identify defects on those lenses. We used a non-contact
    method,” and so on. That's pretty much an industrial thing. It very much applies.
    So focus more on applied projects, for example.
  sec: 1578
  time: '26:18'
  who: Tatiana
- line: If you’ve collaborated with big companies, that also helps. Things like that.
    Obviously, they had to take a risk with me, as well. But you just have to be better
    than all the other candidates. For example, if your experience was different,
    it's probably not that preferable, compared to if you just moved to another big
    tech company in the same role. However, you're always assessed compared to other
    candidates. If you pass all interviews better than other candidates, it's okay.
    They may consider you, even if you changed the role. So you have to prepare better
    for interviews and be better than others.
  sec: 1578

  who: Tatiana
- line: We wanted to spend quite some time talking about interviews. But before that,
    I'm really curious – how did you understand for yourself that the staff role is
    really for you? You didn't have this prior experience in industry. Somebody probably
    told you that you don't have to start from a junior position, right? Then you
    learned about this staff role – you learned it exists – and you learned that it's
    something that might fit your background and your experience, and you started
    preparing for this. So how did this happen?

    contact them, they contacted me first. So the same was Meta? I did not contact
    them. They wrote to me first. In fact, when I was working in the hospital, I did
    not even consider big tech companies. I knew it was very hard to get to and that
    you need to prepare for interviews and solve those LeetCode problems. So I didn't
    apply to those, but rather they reached out to me. The first was Meta who wrote
    “Your resume is fantastic for our role.” I was a bit surprised, but I decided
    “Why not try the interviews? At the end of the day, I have nothing to lose.”

    senior staff role after we discussed my experience. I thought “Okay,” and I went
    to the interviews and I failed coding. [laughs] But the rest was brilliant. I
    got overwhelmingly great feedback on system design, machine learning design, cultural
    fit, everything – just coding, obviously, wasn’t good, because I didn't prepare.
    Then I realized, “Okay, it's not that hard to actually pass interviews at big
    tech companies. All I need is just to start doing LeetCode and that’s it.” [chuckles]

    me for a lead role. In fact, I had an offer for a lead role at one of the startups
    – leading the direction. They kind of justified it this way after we discussed
    my experience. That put my level up a bit from what I initially thought, because
    this was validation from outside. As I said, I felt coding would matter, but they
    did not send me away because I was quite good at system design. So they decided
    to give me a second chance and waited. They agreed to give me a chance to prepare
    for coding interviews and gave me 5-6 weeks. I started learning LeetCode full
    time.

    we have a staff position. Would you mind applying?” I decided “Why not go to interviews?
    I have nothing to lose.” And I passed because the LeetCode was ready. [chuckles]
    So it was them who decided to contact me. Why did they decide to contact me? Because
    somebody referred me. And why did somebody refer me? Because I helped that somebody
    two years before that. Help people – Karma comes back. When they offered me a
    staff role, I thought to myself that I wouldn't even apply for that position,
    maybe. But they approached me first. Then I found that, indeed, I am quite a good
    fit for this particular type of stuff. There’s a lot of cross-team cross-functional
    collaboration. For this particular type of work, I'm a good fit.

    others. We talked about forming teams, how you approach a career change, and helping
    others was one of the things there. I guess you were doing this for quite some
    time and then karma thanked you for it. I liked what you said just now multiple
    times about having nothing to lose – every time an opportunity came, you said,

    okay. I learned this, this and this.” I failed a lot before I passed, by the way.
    In the beginning, I was failing every interview. I failed Lyft. I failed Meta
    in the end, because I didn't pass that coding again. [chuckles] And I failed lots
    of startups and so on. But I don't feel that it affects my self-esteem because
    I consider it learning. I need to learn the interview process. The interview process
    has nothing to do with my abilities, expertise, and so on. I don't consider evaluation
    at an interview a true evaluation of you. It's more like an evaluation of your
    interview skills, in a way.

    remember you were helping me. Thank you for the mock interviews as well. I asked
    many people to help me with that and I learned a lot about that as well. When
    I started to realize which problems I need to solve, how to present myself, and

    for the interviews and learning how to explain your thoughts well.

    is not necessarily bad. It's an opportunity to learn. [Tatiana agrees] You said
    that during the interview with Meta, you did quite well at system design, ML design
    and there were other things where you didn’t do well, like coding (LeetCode kind
    of questions). So how did you actually, without working in the industry, manage
    to prepare yourself and pass these interviews?

  who: Alexey
- line: For the big tech companies – let's separate startups from big tech companies,
    since they have different flows. For the startups, it's actually hard to prepare
    because they can ask you whatever they want and in any manner they want. For the
    big tech companies, the process is more or less standardized and goes through
    certain steps, which you can familiarize yourself with and start preparing. One
    of the important aspects of big tech companies, during coding interviews they
    ask you the types of questions that you can find in LeetCode.
  sec: 2115

  who: Tatiana

    There are guys who can come and solve it, but they participated in competitive
    programming and they solved about a 1000 of them in school. So that doesn't count.
    [chuckles] If you never solved them, and you never saw 1000s of them in school,
    the big chances are that you will not pass that interview. That interview is more
    about preparation than about your coding skills, which is a bit annoying for most
    programmers in the boat. But this is a scalable solution and that's how you can
    assess different candidates fairly. That was the biggest challenge for me. Although
    I know that for some people, machine learning design is the biggest challenge.
    Meanwhile, some people are not very good at behavioral interviews. Everybody's
    different.
  sec: 2115
  time: '35:15'
  who: Tatiana
- line: For me, the biggest challenge, as I realized, was this LeetCode-type of interview.
    I got LeetCode Premium. That was a good idea. In LeetCode Premium, you don’t only
    see popular questions, but you can also see solutions, and they also provide you
    cards with theory. So I will start by studying recursion, how to form it, and
    then I'll go through some common tasks with solutions. After you've done 10 of
    those, you can solve the 11th yourself, hopefully. For every topic, it was like
    that. All the topics were new for me, I didn't even know about recursion when
    I started, because I don't have a computer science degree – I didn't do algorithms
    in university, so maybe that's why it was the biggest challenge for me. In total,
    I'd say two months is enough.
  sec: 2115
  time: '35:15'
  who: Tatiana
- line: As for me, at that time, the work in the hospital stopped because that's exactly
    what happens when you don't raise funding for the next proposals, as I described.
    Sometimes you fail and then you're jobless. That’s exactly what happened in the
    hospital – we didn’t raise money for the next stage – and everybody who was not
    a doctor (who was a contractor) became jobless. This means that I had plenty of
    time for coding. I was coding nine to five every day. In 5-6 weeks, I got like
    300 problems in LeetCode. So if you solve about 300-350 problems, mostly focusing
    on medium (not easy) and do all the theory – I'd say for some big tech companies,
    it will be enough. Maybe not for Google, but for many it will be enough. That's
    how I prepared for LeetCode.

    solve a lot of problems, especially if you don't have a computer science background,
    such as in your case. How about other parts? System design, ML designed, behavioral…
    I think for behavioral, like you said, you have the soft skills from academia,
    and then it’s probably just thinking about situations you had in academia and
    then describing these stations. How about these two others? System design and
    ML design, which you don't do in academia, I guess.
  sec: 2384
  time: '39:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Surprisingly easy for me, was ML design. I realized that in academia, I was
    designing optical systems in lasers, and they have much in common with machine
    learning designs. You also start from scratch with the first principles, you understand
    what you want to accomplish, what data you need to collect, how much data, how
    you want to annotate it, and so on. You can see the different options and their
    tradeoffs – basically, ML design, in the way of thinking, it's quite similar to
    design in physics. Yeah, they’re completely different fields and you need to know
    different techniques and stuff. But the way of thinking, of decompositioning a
    problem, and planning, and about the details, and your intuition – physics helps
    a lot here, to be honest. That was my discovery.
  sec: 2426
  time: '40:26'
  who: Tatiana
- line: To do that properly, I've done several mock interviews on ML design with people
    I know. Mock interviews helped me the most. I also found some blog posts about
    ML design and a couple of YouTube videos. There was also the Grokking ML Design
    course, but I did not like that one, to be honest. The best was a blog post by
    Patrick Kalina, who basically wrote how to answer ML design on the staff level.
    He's a staff at Pinterest. I followed his guide, more or less – his plan.
  sec: 2426
  time: '40:26'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Another useful thing was, going on the blog post for each particular company
    and reading about their ML designs. For example, I go to Lyft’s site, open their
    blog post and read about their ML designs. Then in interviews, when they ask me,
    I say, “Yeah, I've read in your blog post that you do it the following way.” That's
    already a plus, because you prepared – you know what stack they're using and you
    know what kind of designs they’re working on. If you go to YouTube – you can just
    open the papers, they publish recommendation systems and archives even. Read whatever
    is published in the blog posts and familiarize yourself with how they design things.
    I think it makes sense to do that.
  sec: 2426
  time: '40:26'
  who: Tatiana
- line: When you study for a number of companies, like YouTube, Google, TripAdvisor,
    and so on, you start to see the patterns as well. Also, they often write – for
    example Airbnb also wrote about their ML design attempt – they write what worked,
    what didn't work in industry (in real life). Like all those academic narrow papers,
    what you see in academic papers is not always really applicable to industry. Or
    maybe they just move a metric by 0.001% with a lot of effort, and that's not what
    you're gonna do. So having those blog posts from companies helped identify patterns
    and answer a lot of questions.

    summarize. So I have notes on ML design, on system design, and I have three of
    those notebooks on LeetCode. With LeetCode, I realized that it works better when
    you write by hand. Whenever I have a challenging task that I can't solve and easily
    understand, and even after I understand it, I still want to engrave it in my memory
    – I just take a pen and write it down, like literally write it down, because that's
    how I remember things. It helps me. It was a lot of systematic knowledge, but
    for ML design, it just took maybe a week. For system design, it took me like five
    days to prepare. For LeetCode, it was almost two months. For other people, it
    can be different timelines.

    the Grokking System Design course. It was quite cheap – I think $50 or something
    along those lines. I bought it and I started it. That was enough to pass the interview.
    Although, if you want in-depth understanding, people advise reading the Data Intensive
    Applications book, which I also read parts of. But for the interview, actually
    having that course and 20 mock interviews (mock interviews are important, very
    important) that will be enough to pass the interview. But this doesn’t make you
    a great system designer, of course. You need to have some hands-on practice after.

    to understand system design, because you're designing ML systems at scale. But
    if you're hired for an ML role, the ML part, I'd say, is more important than your
    experience with load balancers and things like that. There is always the infrastructure
    team in big companies who take care of that. But you need to understand on a high
    level how it works, more or less. But if you don't know all the load balancing
    techniques after some time, maybe it's not crucial. It depends on your role.

    that interview with Facebook, because why not try and then for the ML part, I
    already tried and failed at Lyft, and I passed at Shutterstock, and I had some
    offers. So the ML part was pretty much trained. System design was specifically
    for Facebook, because in other companies, they didn't ask for it. They didn't
    ask for system design at LinkedIn, for example. At Facebook, they asked for system
    design. I did not have a chance to prepare for that before but I already scheduled
    an interview, so I had a deadline.
  sec: 2832
  time: '47:12'
  who: Tatiana
- line: I just did the entire course in five days and had a few mock interviews with
    people who worked at Facebook. A great help was that I could practice by doing
    a mock interview with a person who worked at Facebook, and he knew what was expected
    on system design. But I didn’t pass because of that – I passed because the role
    was more about an intersection of machine learning and optics. We didn't dive
    that much into system design, but we were discussing things like 3D reconstruction
    and epipolar axes and optics. And that's my field. I got a bit lucky as well with
    the topic, but that's how they selected my resume out of all these other resumes.
    I think they needed somebody who has expertise in optics. And that helped.

- header: Mock interviews and building a mentor network
- line: From what I heard from you, having a network is really helpful. If you know
    somebody or can get to know somebody from Meta, or from the company where you
    have an interview, and just ask them “Hey, can you have a mock interview with
    me, please?” And then they just say “Yes,” and that's how you prepare, right?
    As I understand, just taking the courses is not enough, right?
  sec: 2923
  time: '48:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it’s not enough. It's hard to put it all in your head properly. During
    mock interviews, you learn more. Yes, it's nice if you have mentors and people
    who are willing to help you, but ideally, I try to have a mutual connection, where
    I give value to the person and he gives value to me. What can you do if other
    people are much more experienced than you? You cannot provide them more than they
    contribute. But there were also mock interviews when we did it mutually. I interviewed
    the guy and he interviewed me, and we both prepared for the same level of position.
  sec: 2949
  time: '49:09'
  who: Tatiana
- line: There were a couple of interviews like that. Luckily, I had mentors who were
    willing just to help me, but I would just send them a painting as a thank you,
    for instance. I like to give something in return, but it’s not always possible
    to give the same level of return because they're more advanced. Well, then you
    can gift a painting, for example.
  sec: 2949
  time: '49:09'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Sometimes people are just fine with helping without expecting anything in
    return, because who knows? Maybe in 10 years, you will be their manager or something.
    Like this karma thing that you mentioned – you help somebody and then after some
    time they refer you and you get a job.
  sec: 3009
  time: '50:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think that's also a good strategy. I always try to help other people.
    There are people whom I mentor, where I’m more advanced than them and there are
    people who mentor me. So across the globe, there’s all this getting help and providing
    help. I like to keep it balanced – even more on the helping side. Also, I think
    it makes you happier if you help somebody and you see their progress.
  sec: 3027
  time: '50:27'
  who: Tatiana
- line: It does, yeah. I see that there are some questions. A question from Harry,
    “As a staff AI engineer, how much of your time do you deal with data engineers,
    data scientists, with building ETLs, building pipelines, and doing all this MLOps
    stuff?”
  sec: 3052
  time: '50:52'
  who: Alexey
- header: Staff involvement in MLOps, ETL, pipelines, and data team collaboration
- line: Yes. Again, it depends on the project. There are some projects where you have
    a lot of collaboration with data scientists, because you require some initial
    analysis and things. And there are some projects, where you collaborate more with
    the product team. In some projects, you'll have to collaborate quite a lot with
    legal. So it's kind of project-based, but as I said, all those collaborations
    take around half of my time.
  sec: 3070
  time: '51:10'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Then the other half goes on design and reviewing and preparing the docs and
    things like that. For ETL pipelines, I do implement some because I like to stay
    hands-on, but most of the time, they're implemented for you by people who you
    mentor. You just decide what has to be done and they implement it and you review
    the code.
  sec: 3070
  time: '51:10'
  who: Tatiana
- line: You said that you do quite a lot of code reviewing, right?
  sec: 3130
  time: '52:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: A lot, yeah. Quite a lot of code review.
  sec: 3135
  time: '52:15'
  who: Tatiana
- header: Managing heavy code review load and context switching across projects
- line: For me, doing code review is difficult because if I'm working with multiple
    projects at the same time, every time I review a piece of code, I need to get
    back into the context of that specific project and understand why this code is
    written in exactly this way. This is very difficult, especially if it's like three,
    four projects at the same time. How do you do this?
  sec: 3139
  time: '52:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I could have like five projects at the same time. But I remember each
    of them quite well. You jump between meetings literally, now you’re discussing
    this project, the next project, 25 minutes, 25 minutes – you just jump between
    meetings and you're already switching contexts. I think this just trains you to
    always be in context. Or maybe it’s just my thing that I am quite easy to switch
    and I remember what's going on in like five different projects.
  sec: 3163
  time: '52:43'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Did you do anything special to get this skill? Or was it just always like
    that for you?
  sec: 3194
  time: '53:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was always like that for me. Context switching was always easy for me.
  sec: 3201
  time: '53:21'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Okay. Because I was going to ask you for advice on how to approach that. But…
    [chuckles]
  sec: 3210
  time: '53:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is just a gift, maybe? I don't know. [chuckles] Yeah, it's easy for me
    to switch from meeting to meeting, completely changing contexts, different projects
    that we discuss. Hard to advise on what to do about it. [chuckles]
  sec: 3216
  time: '53:36'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Maybe I guess what worked for me in the end, I think, is somehow to arrange
    things in a way that doesn't require context switching, meaning doing things sequentially,
    and then maybe have this box. But yeah, it's not easy, at least for me.
  sec: 3237
  time: '53:57'
  who: Alexey
- header: Advice for academics aiming for staff roles in industry
- line: Another question that we have in the list that I didn't ask you is “Let's
    say somebody wants to follow your path and go from academia to industry, and also
    get on a staff level. What advice would you give to them?”
  sec: 3253
  time: '54:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a good question. First of all – don't be shy going to the tech
    lead role or lead role. If you were leading in academia, you have most of the
    challenging, transferable soft skills. It's much harder to learn that than to
    learn programming or Git and other tools. Prepare some pet projects that are in
    line. But also look at your own career as a whole and the parts where you were
    leading things, initializing things, mentoring, teaching, upleveling the team
    – all that is quite transferable and important. If you are able to understand
    the requirements of the future role of a lead or tech lead, get them, and see
    how this aligns with your previous experience. Prepare well for the cultural interview.
  sec: 3276
  time: '54:36'
  who: Tatiana
- line: The behavioral interview is exactly when you show yourself at the right level
    – most of it. You do that during all the interviews, but the cultural and behavioral
    interviews are where you mainly show your leadership skills, your ownership. Prepare
    well for that. You may also want to practice that with somebody who already is
    in industry and in a high level role – if you happen to have such a mentor, like
    a director. I didn't, so I didn't prepare. But if I could, I would use that chance.
    Also, get feedback. Some people even get coaching and consulting and all that.
  sec: 3276
  time: '54:36'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Obviously, also prepare well for the other interviews, because even if you're
    a great leader and everything, but you completely fail the coding, we know you
    will not get the job, as we know. [laughs] You have to be ready for the other
    interviews too. Give yourself time. It's okay, if you fail for some time. It took
    me a year between when I started interviewing and I couldn't pass, up to the point
    when I had all the interviews turn into all offers. I had like five interviews
    in process and like five offers – 100%. So from 0% to 100%, it took me one year
    and a lot of failures. Be ready for that. If you don't fail, and you don't try,
    you're not gonna get it. It’s like kids who are learning something – they always
    fail from the first time.
  sec: 3276
  time: '54:36'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Learn to live with failure, right? It's not about you, personally.
  sec: 3414
  time: '56:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it's not about you. I wouldn’t even consider it as a failure. For me failure
    is something where you really lose. Like mountaineering is dangerous, but with
    interviews – if you fail, you're exactly where you started, so it's not really
    a failure. It's more like a try with no risk. You have nothing to lose, really.
  sec: 3418
  time: '56:58'
  who: Tatiana
- line: You're saying this, like the third or fourth time? But this is the case, right?
    [chuckles]
  sec: 3444
  time: '57:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Because it is the case, yes. When people don't want to try because they're
    afraid, I completely don't understand it.
  sec: 3449
  time: '57:29'
  who: Tatiana
- header: 'Excitement of AI work: generative models, R&D freedom, and measurable impact'
- line: A question from Chali is, “What is the most exciting thing about working as
    an AI staff engineer?”
  sec: 3460
  time: '57:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, yes. This is a very interesting field. Look what's happening now with
    all this ChatGPT and diffusion models and so on. You’re at the edge of technology,
    you're actually like one of the first people who are making the future and moving
    into the future. That's very exciting. You can actually try lots of different
    technologies and you have the freedom of what you want to try, because you can
    also lead some R&D projects, for example. I find it very exciting that you have
    to learn in this fast-changing field, when the future is really coming. Every
    few months, you have some new revolution, some changes – that's very interesting
    and that's very cool. Mastering this and understanding how it all works is very
    interesting.
  sec: 3469
  time: '57:49'
  who: Tatiana
- line: The other part is, if you really like this (I was craving for this in science)
    to see quite a big and fast turnover between your work and some impact metrics
    of revenue and so on in the company where you work. When you actually push things
    into production and you see how they influence things and you see the impact –
    it's very pleasant. This is not always the case in science. Sometimes you develop
    lots of things, you write papers, but you don't feel its need and you don't feel
    the impact. It takes time in science to make an impact.
  sec: 3469
  time: '57:49'
  who: Tatiana
- line: Yeah, thanks. I know we're running out of time, but this one will be the last
    one and really quick. Are there any books or other learning resources that you
    can recommend to the listeners?
  sec: 3565
  time: '59:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, there are lots of books depending on what you want. [chuckles] I think…
    [cross-talk]
  sec: 3577
  time: '59:37'
  who: Tatiana
- line: I was thinking like one or two. [chuckles]
  sec: 3581
  time: '59:41'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Recommended books: communication, staff engineering, and leadership'
- line: 'I like communication. For communication, I think it''s important to learn
    how to communicate. There’s “Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes
    Are High” and “Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended
    On It”. Those are the best two. If you want to understand about the staff role,
    the “Staff Engineering Path” is the best book on that, I''d say. I like books
    in general about leadership and ownership and stuff. There is the book “Extreme
    Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win,” and for career it''s highly advised
    to read the book “Rise,” by Patty Azzarello. That would be career-oriented books.'

- header: Episode closing and final thanks
- line: Thank you. It’s always a pleasure having you here. Maybe in two years we should
    have a chat again and see what changed. Thanks for joining us today. Thanks for
    sharing your knowledge, your experience of getting this staff AI engineering role,
    and sharing what you do with us. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Everyone,
    have a great weekend.
