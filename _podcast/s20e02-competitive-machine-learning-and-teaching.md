  time: '5:42'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Alexander’s career journey: From Kaggle to industry and teaching'
- line: Sure. My career started about 10 years ago when I was a student at a university
    in Moscow. I was looking for an opportunity to learn machine learning, which was
    a new and exciting field at the time. I found that opportunity on Kaggle.

  time: '6:28'
  who: Alexander
- line: After Kaggle, I moved to the industry. I worked as a data analyst at Avito,
    then as a data scientist at Yandex, handling ride-sharing services. Later, I worked
    at Mechanica AI, a startup focused on bringing machine learning to industrial
    enterprises. We even traveled to small cities in Siberia to find product engineers
    and see if they needed our machine learning solutions.
  sec: 388
  time: '6:28'
  who: Alexander
- line: Eventually, I worked at Iterative.ai, a San Francisco-based startup that creates
    open-source tools for machine learning engineers and data scientists. After that,
    I moved back to Moscow to work at Central University, where I now focus on teaching.
  sec: 388
  time: '6:28'
  who: Alexander
- line: Since you mentioned Iterative.ai, I want to thank them for supporting this
    community. Their support helped grow the community to where it is today.
  sec: 486
  time: '8:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I was part of the team. My friend Mikhail Sveshenkov gave a talk at one
    of your events about a tool we were building called MLEM.
  sec: 516
  time: '8:36'
  who: Alexander
- line: MLEM? Is that the sound a cat makes?
  sec: 535
  time: '8:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it’s based on an internet meme where a dog or cat sticks its tongue
    out. We were trying to be funny.
  sec: 547
  time: '9:07'
  who: Alexander
- line: Are you still involved in open-source projects?
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not right now. I mostly worked on open-source tools while at Iterative.
  sec: 571
  time: '9:31'
  who: Alexander
- line: You mentioned starting your career as a student 10 years ago with Kaggle.
    For me, Kaggle was also a gateway into data science. I thought I was good at machine
    learning, but my first Kaggle competition showed me how much I still had to learn.
  sec: 579
  time: '9:39'
  who: Alexey
- header: How Alexander got started with Kaggle and his early experiences
- line: I started Kaggle while studying at university. I chose a machine learning
    lab for my bachelor’s thesis but quickly realized how challenging it was. I found
    Kaggle as a place to test my practical skills.
  sec: 701
  time: '11:41'
  who: Alexander
- line: There was a strong Kaggle community in Moscow, with weekly sessions where
    people shared solutions and discussed ideas. I spent a lot of time on Kaggle,
    even skipping lectures to focus on competitions.
  sec: 701
  time: '11:41'
  who: Alexander
- line: Skipping lectures? Did you get kicked out of university?
  sec: 858
  time: '14:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, the educational system allowed me to skip most of the semester and focus
    on exams.
  sec: 873
  time: '14:33'
  who: Alexander
- line: How did you balance Kaggle and university?
  sec: 887
  time: '14:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: I spent a lot of time on Kaggle, but I managed to pass my exams. It was a
    year of intense focus before I got my first job.
  sec: 895
  time: '14:55'
  who: Alexander
- line: In Germany, it’s similar—what matters is how well you pass the exams, not
    how much you study during the semester.
  sec: 924
  time: '15:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, the system is changing now, but back then, it worked for me.
  sec: 942
  time: '15:42'
  who: Alexander
- line: You said the secret to success on Kaggle is putting in a lot of time. I can
    confirm that. In one competition, I spent 3 months working on it, putting in 5-10
    hours per week. It was exhausting, but I learned a lot.
  sec: 956
  time: '15:56'
  who: Alexey

    detection, and that experience was useful in my job at OLX, which was the parent
    company of Avito.
  sec: 1100
  time: '18:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: My first serious competition was on a platform called CrowdAnalytix. The training
    set was small, so it was more about luck than skill.
  sec: 1134
  time: '18:54'
  who: Alexander
- line: Kaggle solutions often involve complex stacking, which isn’t practical for
    production. But you still learn a lot from competing.
