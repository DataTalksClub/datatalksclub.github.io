title: Indie Hacking
transcript:
- header: Episode Introduction
- line: This week we'll talk about indie hacking. We have a special guest today, Pauline.
    Pauline is a data science manager and a consultant at IBM, where she has worked
    for eight years. She is also an indie hacker and is working on a few side hustles
    in crypto and generative AI. One of her latest projects allows uploading a few
    selfies and it generates a lot of cool and stylish pictures and I use this service
    too. So welcome, Pauline.

  who: Alexey
- line: Hi. I'm glad to be invited here. I don't see anyone but I guess there are
    some people.
  sec: 28
  time: 0:28
  who: Pauline
- line: I'll open YouTube from my phone, so I make sure I don't miss any questions.
    Today, I didn't create a Slido link because we were late and I was struggling
    with Zoom. So today, if you have any questions during today's conversation, please
    put them in the live chat and I will be covering these questions. Also the questions
    for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, for your
    help. Now let's start.
  sec: 37
  time: 0:37
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Journey: Engineering Student to IBM Data Scientist'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of indie hacking. Let's start with your background.
    Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 72
  time: '1:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. I started as an engineer – I studied engineering at school. But
    at this time, eight years ago, data science was very new. There weren't any courses
    about it – just one in France, actually. But I wasn't in this school. I applied
    to IBM because it was my dream to work there and it was a match. I was accepted.
    I studied as a junior data scientist, but I didn't learn it before because there
    weren't any schools for it. I learned by myself.
  sec: 80
  time: '1:20'
  who: Pauline
- line: Then I became a senior consultant in data science two years later and it's
    been three or four years. I'm a manager now. Aside from this, I am an indie hacker.
    From the beginning of the year – it's been a year actually, more or less exactly
    one year. Yeah, but we will talk more about it in this interview.
  sec: 80
  time: '1:20'
  who: Pauline
- line: So your first job after graduating was IBM and you're still at IBM.
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm still at IBM. Yes.
  sec: 156
  time: '2:36'
  who: Pauline
- line: That's pretty impressive. People usually don't stick around for that long
    at one company.
  sec: 157
  time: '2:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I know.
  sec: 164
  time: '2:44'
  who: Pauline
- line: You must like your job a lot.
  sec: 165
  time: '2:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I like it a lot. Indeed.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Pauline
- line: So what do you do as a data consultant at IBM?
  sec: 173
  time: '2:53'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Consulting Work: Project Types and Client Engagement'
- line: When you are a data consultant, it means I work in the data science area for
    various clients. I work from project to project. A project is a mission. It can
    last one month or four years, for example. I think my shortest mission lasted
    one month and the longer one was two years. So it really depends. I see various
    clients, various domains. I'm not specialized in a specific business – I work
    in banks, aerospace, automotive, and also in different data science contexts,
    which can be things like predicting sales or explainability models. So I'm not
    specialized. And it's my choice, actually.
  sec: 178
  time: '2:58'
  who: Pauline
- line: So the way it works is a customer approaches IBM and says, “Hey, I have this
    kind of project. Give us some people to work on this project.” And then you, along
    with your team, join the client and you work with them on a particular project.
    Is that right?
  sec: 242
  time: '4:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. Usually I'm working in a team and there are two or four data
    scientists that I'm working with. I’m more into the managing part now, but I can
    also do the models and help by coding, usually in Python.
  sec: 258
  time: '4:18'
  who: Pauline
- line: What do you do as a managing partner? What kind of responsibilities do you
    have?
  sec: 279
  time: '4:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not a partner but a manager. [cross-talk]
  sec: 284
  time: '4:44'
  who: Pauline
- line: As a manager/consultant, right?
  sec: 288
  time: '4:48'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Manager Role: Deliverables, Roadmaps, and Client Communication'
- line: Yes. As a manager, you ensure that the models are created. That it fits the
    client's needs. You are also the relation between the clients and the team. I
    can present the results of what we achieved, what is in the roadmap – those kinds
    of tasks.
  sec: 290
  time: '4:50'
  who: Pauline
- line: Interesting. I don't know if you can discuss that, but if you can – what are
    some interesting projects that you worked on at IBM?
  sec: 318
  time: '5:18'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Case Study: Money-Laundering Detection Project and Deployment'
- line: Yes. I won't name the clients, but I worked for two years to detect money
    laundering.
  sec: 331
  time: '5:31'
  who: Pauline
- line: Money laundering. Okay.
  sec: 344
  time: '5:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it was very interesting because I had to think as a person that can
    do money laundering. So I had to say, “Okay, I have this data. What can I do?”
    I was working on two years past data, so the team and I had to build a model –
    a system to detect “strange behavior,” let's say.
  sec: 352
  time: '5:52'
  who: Pauline
- line: How can you think like a money launderer?
  sec: 383
  time: '6:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: First there are some patterns that are famous like, let’s say you do some
    sports betting. It's a tennis match, for example, with Nadal vs Federer and you
    say, “Okay, Nadal will win.” And you also bet that Federer will win. In the end,
    you will have spent some money on both, so of course, you will lose money. But
    for someone who wants to launder money, he doesn't want to earn money, but lose
    as little as possible.
  sec: 389
  time: '6:29'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay, that's a nice strategy.
  sec: 426
  time: '7:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. And what was interesting is that I started to frame the project and
    I saw it through until the end – the deployment part.
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Pauline
- header: 'Indie Hacking Explained: Bootstrapping Without External Funding'
- line: Okay, that's all quite interesting and I want to ask more. But that's not
    the main topic today. Right? The main topic today is what you started one year
    ago, as you said, which is indie hacking. Maybe, can you tell us what indie hacking
    actually is?
  sec: 443
  time: '7:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Indie hacking when you are building projects – I'm not sure if this is the
    exact definition but – it's to build projects and to monetize them without any
    funding. I think this is a new trend, but what was famous before is you have a
    project, you do a pitch deck, and you try to find investors to invest funds in
    your company. But I don't do this. I built it with another friend.
  sec: 460
  time: '7:40'
  who: Pauline
- line: We are three, actually, but two of us build it and the other one helps us
    with administrative and legal. We built this in our free time so we don't have
    any pressure. We launch when we can. We wanted to launch something this week,
    but it will be delayed. But it's okay, we don't have any pressure. Nobody knows
    about it. So that's my definition of indie hacking.
  sec: 460
  time: '7:40'
  who: Pauline
- header: 'Day Job + Side Projects: Time Allocation and Routine'
- line: So basically, during daytime, you work at IBM as a data science manager, but
    after work (after 5pm or 6pm) you start working on your side projects.
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. Also during the weekend (mostly during the weekend). It was
    great, because in December, I had a lot of holidays so I worked a lot on my projects.
    [chuckles]
  sec: 552
  time: '9:12'
  who: Pauline
- line: I know in France, you get a lot of holidays – a lot of vacation days.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Quite a lot.
  sec: 569
  time: '9:29'
  who: Pauline
- line: So that's a good country for indie hacking, right? [Pauline agrees] So “indie”
    I guess means “independent,” right? That's the part that means, as you said, that
    you don't get any funding from anyone. You just start working on a project and
    then you see what happens. And the goal that you have is monetizing this project,
    i.e. earning money with this project.
  sec: 571
  time: '9:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. It doesn't cost a lot. It’s just servers. But we don't need
    funding.
  sec: 591
  time: '9:51'
  who: Pauline
- line: Why “hacking” though? “Indie” is “independent” but why “hacking”? Why not
    just “indie projects” or “indie work” or something else? “Hacking” is more attractive?
  sec: 598
  time: '9:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I'm not the one who invented this term. But, let's say, I “rebuilt”
    it. I don't know. Some people say “indie maker,” others say “bootstrappers”. There
    are different synonyms. I don't know, but I use “indie hacking”.
  sec: 608
  time: '10:08'
  who: Pauline
- line: Some time ago, I was into games. In games, there was also this concept of
    “indie developers”. Usually, when you have a game, you work with some sort of
    publisher who then promotes the game and distributes it. But there are some indie
    developers who don't rely on these publishers – on this network. They just create
    a game and they use their own channels for distribution. I guess it's kind of
    a similar idea. But here, instead of funding, you have independent channels, right?  [Pauline
    agrees] Okay. Tell us about your projects that you do as a part of your indie
    hacking.
  sec: 630
  time: '10:30'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Cryptopy Origin: Building Crypto Alerts for Personal Trading'
- line: Yeah. Everything started with Cryptopy. That was my first project. Actually,
    for Cryptopy, at the very beginning, I did some trading of crypto and I noticed
    some patterns in the charts. And I was like, “Okay, that would be great to make
    some things that could tell me whenever crypto would react in some way.” I was
    trading with technical indicators. At this time, I think it was five years ago,
    I didn’t have very much development skills. Two years ago, during COVID, we were
    allowed to travel in France, but we had to be home at night – a curfew.
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Pauline
- line: I visited some friends and one of them is a developer. I asked her, “Hey,
    do you want to work with me on this project?” Because it really took a lot of
    time to trade. She said yes, so we built our own solution to be alerted whenever
    a crypto matches our strategy. We used it and we also automated some parts to
    trade, but we used it for a year and it was very profitable. So I said, “Okay,
    it's great for us.” So maybe we can also offer it to others. We launched an offer
    of alerting in crypto. It was in September that we launched the offer.
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay, so first, you used it only for yourself – you used it for trading crypto.
    And it wasn't public, it was just you and your friend who used it. [Pauline agrees]
    But then you thought it could be useful for others too and then you made it public.
    Is that right?
  sec: 801
  time: '13:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. We use it privately and the company was created in January of last
    year. But in September, we launched the offer. It wasn't a success at all. [chuckles]
  sec: 819
  time: '13:39'
  who: Pauline
- line: It wasn’t?
  sec: 836
  time: '13:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no, no, no. It's very hard because this is not my audience. I don't know
    a lot of traders, so it's hard to be known in this domain. And it's okay. I mean,
    we built it for us, so we learn from it. That was the beginning and we said “Okay,
    we launched one offer, why not launch something else?”
  sec: 838
  time: '13:58'
  who: Pauline
- line: But at least you made money with this tool anyway – for your own trading.
  sec: 866
  time: '14:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 871
  time: '14:31'
  who: Pauline
- line: So that was useful. [Pauline agrees] You said it wasn't successful in the
    end, but I'm still curious – between the time you realized that it's useful for
    others and the time when you actually launched it, what happened?
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: What happened? Umm…
  sec: 889
  time: '14:49'
  who: Pauline
- line: What did you do exactly from that moment in January when you opened the company?
    You were doing something in the other months – between January and September –
    right? So what did you do then?
  sec: 892
  time: '14:52'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Productization: Company Setup, Landing Pages, Legal and Payments'
- line: In January, we created the company because it was better for us to have money
    in common. We used our system on our side – so we had to maintain two systems,
    which was a bit time consuming. We decided to create one company in order to join
    our investing money and maintain only one solution. That's why. Then, I think
    it was in August that we said, “Okay, we can launch an offer.” It was very quick
    to transform it to an offer, because everything was coded, so we just had to make
    a landing page, and do a bit of legal things like licenses and things like that.
    But it didn't take much time.
  sec: 909
  time: '15:09'
  who: Pauline
- line: What did you use for the landing page?
  sec: 966
  time: '16:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: What did I use?
  sec: 970
  time: '16:10'
  who: Pauline
- line: Can you tell us what the landing page is? Why do you need a landing page?
    Isn't it enough to just create an app and expect people to join?
  sec: 972
  time: '16:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, by landing page I mean our website. It's not a mobile app or something
    like that. People had to know about it, so we created a landing page. I created
    it from scratch. I was the one to do it because I already built some websites.
    I reused a lot and changed, of course, the content, images, etc.
  sec: 984
  time: '16:24'
  who: Pauline
- line: So you just used something like Bootstrap, I guess, and then put some text
    there and a button that says “sign up here,” right? That's what the landing page
    is?
  sec: 1017
  time: '16:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Yes. Exactly.
  sec: 1024
  time: '17:04'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay, so you did this and then you also said that you needed to take care
    of some legal parts. What was that? What did you need to take care of?
  sec: 1027
  time: '17:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It was a product to monetize, so you have to take care of privacy, terms
    of use, and things like that. Also, you have to think about, “If I want to monetize,
    I'll also need a payment system.” So we had to find it and integrate it to our
    app – those kinds of things. But you don't have to think about this if you build
    it for yourself.
  sec: 1038
  time: '17:18'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay, so the privacy policy and all these things. I guess you don't want to
    get sued if somebody loses money?
  sec: 1077
  time: '17:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. No, I don't. [chuckles] We are not advisors. At first, we wanted to let
    people automate their trade. But it's legally very complicated, so we don't. We
    just let people say their strategy and they are alerted when the crypto matches
    their strategy.
  sec: 1085
  time: '18:05'
  who: Pauline
- line: And what does your friend do? Is she also in data science, or is she a developer?
  sec: 1111
  time: '18:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, she's a Java developer.
  sec: 1117
  time: '18:37'
  who: Pauline
- line: Java developer, okay. Is this what you used for Cryptopy? Java?
  sec: 1121
  time: '18:41'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Technology Choices: Python/Flask, Team Contributions, and Architecture'
- line: No, we used Python, [chuckles] because I wanted to be able to modify the code.
    Also, with Python, there is a framework that you can use for web development.
    It's called Flask and we used it. But we could have also used Java and do some
    frontend with this better. This is not a technology I know, so we used Python.
    There is one feature that she did in Java.
  sec: 1125
  time: '18:45'
  who: Pauline
- line: I see. So you both work on everything? How do you split responsibilities between
    the two of you?
  sec: 1164
  time: '19:24'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Marketing Efforts: Audience Reach, Social Channels, and Challenges'
- line: For Cryptopy, at first it was equally split for the development and then when
    we thought about launching an offer for people, we split it. She did the development,
    and I'm more in the marketing part – trying to find relationships, etc.
  sec: 1173
  time: '19:33'
  who: Pauline
- line: What do you do in marketing? I guess it’s mainly promoting and letting people
    know that this thing exists, right? You said that you had problems with this.
    So how did you try to approach that?
  sec: 1202
  time: '20:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: For Cryptopy, it was very difficult i. It was also my very first experience,
    because as you know, my “real” job, my day job, is in data science. It's not related
    to marketing. It can be by exploring some marketing models, but it's not the same
    as doing marketing. I tried to join some Facebook groups or Reddit, but I was
    banned very quickly. [chuckles] I said, “Okay, this is not a good approach.” So
    I started Twitter this summer. I thought, “Okay, I could use Twitter to speak
    to people.” And so I did this.
  sec: 1213
  time: '20:13'
  who: Pauline
- line: Very quickly, we noticed that it was very difficult to reach an audience of
    crypto traders. I also contacted a lot of people from crypto – influencers, etc.
    But influencers are very difficult to reach. You have to get money to get them
    to do anything. So we couldn't afford it. Very quickly we said, “Okay, it will
    be very difficult to monetize this offer.” So we left it like that and we started
    building other projects. And so we started UnrealMe.
  sec: 1213
  time: '20:13'
  who: Pauline
- header: Operating Costs and Niche Product Strategy
- line: Before we go into your second project – I'm really curious about that, too
    – maybe you can mention how much it costs you to maintain this thing. You said
    you're not actively working on this right now. It’s just there. But I guess you
    have to pay for hosting and for other things. I’m wondering how expensive is it
    to just let it run in the background?
  sec: 1306
  time: '21:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it costs about 10 euros a month. [chuckles]
  sec: 1326
  time: '22:06'
  who: Pauline
- line: Oh, not that expensive. [Pauline agrees] I guess if more people start using
    it, it will become more expensive, right?
  sec: 1331
  time: '22:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, probably. But not that much. I'm not sure that it will be very much
    more costly, because it doesn't use many databases. So I don't know.
  sec: 1341
  time: '22:21'
  who: Pauline
- line: From what I see, I saw some other ideas or some other projects in this space
    of indie hacking. Most of the projects in the indie hacking space are pretty small
    and focus on a specific problem. They don't do much except for solving this particular
    problem. Is this a correct observation?
  sec: 1355
  time: '22:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. It's all niche markets. Exactly. You try to validate an idea, so you
    start with a small project. If it works, then you invest more time in trying to
    improve it. And if it doesn't, you have to say “Okay, I’m leaving,” and you start
    another one.
  sec: 1385
  time: '23:05'
  who: Pauline
- header: 'UnrealMe Origin: DreamBooth Inspiration and Rapid Prototyping'
- line: So tell us about the other one you had.
  sec: 1413
  time: '23:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I was actually on holiday, and I saw DreamBooth. Also someone called
    Levelsio on Twitter explained that he built a system where you can send pictures
    of yourself and transform them into new pictures. I was wondering how he did this,
    so I did some research. Finally, I told my friends about it to start this and
    said, “Yes, let's do the same.” We didn't reinvent the wheel, but we wanted to
    try it.
  sec: 1417
  time: '23:37'
  who: Pauline
- line: We learned very quickly because we had most of the development done. I think
    we launched in a few weeks after the idea. It was kind of a side of a side project,
    because first we have our work and also because we were actually working on a
    Twitter tool that I hope we will launch very soon.
  sec: 1417
  time: '23:37'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay. You said that this project is called UnrealMe.io. For this project,
    you send a few pictures of yourself and then what it does is use DreamBooth (it
    uses something) to create new pictures from the pictures you send? [Pauline agrees]
    You said you first saw a tweet, and you thought, “Okay, I can do this.” Then you
    contacted your friends who liked the idea, and you released it in a couple of
    weeks.
  sec: 1503
  time: '25:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 1536
  time: '25:36'
  who: Pauline
- line: Can you walk us through how you did it? What exactly did you do between seeing
    this tweet and actually releasing it? What did you need to do?
  sec: 1537
  time: '25:37'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Implementation Decisions: API Fine-Tuning vs Self-Hosted GPUs'
- line: First we studied. We were wondering, “Should we start from scratch with DreamBooth
    (DreamBooth is a model)? Should we use it with our own GPU?” Because it's fine
    tuning images, it uses GPU, and it's very expensive. We had this choice or we
    could use an API to do the fine tuning. We chose the second solution because we
    wanted it to be fast. What happened is – we had this idea, so we had to build
    a system to do the API calls and to store images of the people to send it and
    to get the result. When the result is done, we have to store it and send the picture
    to the users. We had this to do and also to launch it – talk about it on Twitter,
    mainly. But what is funny about it, our first sales weren’t on Twitter and we
    didn't launch yet. I subscribed to a Black Friday list and someone saw it. I don't
    know how. So yeah, that's fun.
  sec: 1548
  time: '25:48'
  who: Pauline
- line: I just want to summarize. First, you saw the idea, which was that there is
    this algorithm called DreamBooth that takes pictures in and then creates new pictures.
    You liked the results and you wanted to make a project – a small software as a
    service project – that other people can use. Then, correct me if I'm wrong, you
    found an API that uses this algorithm and then you built your project around this
    API. Right?
  sec: 1653
  time: '27:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, yes.
  sec: 1688
  time: '28:08'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay. I guess this is another service that you used, right? So you needed
    to pay them? [Pauline agrees] This is an API, but it doesn't take care of storing
    images and all that, so what you needed to build was all these things – getting
    images from the API, saving them somewhere, and then sending them to the customers,
    right?

  who: Alexey

    I just subscribed but I didn't imagine someone would see it, to be honest. And
    wow, yeah. Someone saw it.

  sec: 1744
  time: '29:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: I talked about it on Twitter. I also use some personal media – on my personal
    Instagram or Facebook. But I think mainly all sales came from Twitter and also
    the Black Friday sites, because there were other sales from this website.
  sec: 1747
  time: '29:07'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay. So what did you do? How did you announce this on Twitter? Did you just
    say “Okay, this is our new cool project – go check it out?”
  sec: 1772
  time: '29:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, something like that. [chuckles] I also displayed some pictures of myself
    saying “This was done using UnrealMe.” Yes, that's pretty much it. Maybe there
    is some better way, but I'm still learning for this job. [chuckles]
  sec: 1781
  time: '29:41'
  who: Pauline
- line: Yeah, I cannot think of a better way, probably. That's good. I guess you also
    rely on other people sharing their pictures, right?
  sec: 1807
  time: '30:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. Some people shared the results. You were one of them. Thank
    you. [chuckles] Yeah, I also saw it displayed on the website. Other people can
    have some examples in order to see the result. Also, if they want, they can ask
    the user, “Does it really work?”
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Pauline
- line: Your results were pretty impressive. From my pictures, it didn't work well.
    But the reason for that is, because when I saw that you launched this, I just
    took my phone, took a few selfies from different backgrounds and from different
    angles and that was it. But I guess you used a lot of different images, right?
    So it wasn't from one day.
  sec: 1847
  time: '30:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I remember when you tried, I think you had a green shirt on earlier and
    you have a green shirt now. [chuckles] AI is not magic. I mean, if you send only
    a picture where you are like that, you will be like that on the results. But it's
    not magic. [chuckles]

    you said the main challenge was reaching the target audience (crypto traders)
    and it's not easy. What was the main challenge here?
  sec: 1891
  time: '31:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think the main challenge was also customer acquisition. It is very hard.
    But at least with this project, we made some sales. Not enough to be Ramen profitable,
    which is a very famous target when you are indie hacking. But I think the main
    issue was to reach people and also to get some not too high prices. At the very
    beginning it was very difficult because it cost I think it was 15 euros per fine
    tuning. After you add our costs, it was difficult to do low prices. Also it's
    something that is not very useful. I mean, it's fun to have a picture of yourself
    in AI. It can be useful, I know. You can use it for professional settings. I know
    some people use it for Tinder.
  sec: 1906

  sec: 1987
  time: '33:07'

    and I found the love of my life.” No? [chuckles]

  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] That would be a great story, I guess.'
  sec: 2007
  time: '33:27'
  who: Pauline
- line: Yeah, exactly. [chuckle] I guess in both of these cases reaching the target
    audience was the main problem. [Pauline agrees] Is this always the case? When
    you build something, you cannot expect that people will just come? Do you need
    to proactively promote it?
  sec: 2012
  time: '33:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Proactively. Yeah. This is something that you will really see (or at least
    I saw) when I make sales. Every time I talk about it, it doesn't happen just like
    that. Another issue is the time, of course. I was lucky for UnrealMe because my
    friend was still on maternity leave, so she had time because she was alone at
    home and sometimes with the baby. I know that sometimes she had some time.
  sec: 2028

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think I enjoy the ideation part – thinking about things that could
    be done. I also like to create. That's something that motivates me. I think it’s
    a good addition to my work, because although I like my work – and not that you
    do the same thing all the time at your work, because it's very not true – this
    is kind of a personal project. I can work on whatever I want. I think it's really
    interesting.

    – do they help you with your main job?
  sec: 2147
  time: '35:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, yes, because it gave me a new culture. Before indie hacking, I used
    my free time to do whatever things. Now I use this free time to also know more
    about AI – about data. I guess it's profitable for IBM, of course. Also, I trained
    myself to learn new skills. I think I understand data engineering better now,
    even if it's not really the part I'm working on, I learned GCP with this – some
    parts of it.
  sec: 2159
  time: '35:59'
  who: Pauline

    – social media marketing in particular. What else did you learn?
  sec: 2212
  time: '36:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: What did I learn? I learned that even if you are a very good developer, without
    marketing, you're nothing. [chuckles] There are also some indie hackers that say,
    “Just launch before building,” so they do a landing page with a newsletter and
    see if people are interested. And if they are, then they build. I actually met
    someone who did this and he invalidated his idea like that. So yeah, it really
    depends. I forgot, sorry, the question at the beginning.
  sec: 2223
  time: '37:03'
  who: Pauline
- line: The question was – what kind of new skills did you pick up? GCP, data engineering,
    social media marketing, idea validation – what else?
  sec: 2262
  time: '37:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that's also quite a lot.
  sec: 2271
  time: '37:51'
  who: Pauline

  sec: 2274
  time: '37:54'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 2279
  time: '37:59'

    building the landing pages.
  sec: 2281
  time: '38:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. At first, I built the landing page, but that was a skill I already had.
    After, when we made a few sales, we were able to build some templates. So now,
    for the next project, I can build faster because I have a very nice template already
    done. Because the website I did before was kind of quick to do, but not very awesome.
    At least I don't find it beautiful, but it's the best I could do. Also something
    I learned is about new tools, like using more Photoshop. It's a tool I use a lot,
    but I'm still at the very beginning of learning.
  sec: 2289
  time: '38:09'

  sec: 2352

    at work, right?
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey

    projects sometimes. Yes.

    guess if you work from nine to five, and then at the end, you might be exhausted
    and then you have other projects to work on. How do you find the energy to do
    this?
  sec: 2367
  time: '39:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's just patience. If I told you I love to ride horses then you say,
    “Okay, wow! That takes patience. That’s great!” Or “I love dancing. I do two hours
    every two days.” etc. It's very common to have hobbies like that. Mine is building
    projects. I don't see it as exhausting. For me, I'm motivated to work on it, actually.
    It's not “Okay, my work day is finished. Ugh, I have to work again.” I don't see
    it as work. Actually, I think it's essential if you want to do indie hacking in
    addition to your work, you have to be passionate about it.
  sec: 2389
  time: '39:49'
  who: Pauline

    you might be tired, but you started working on your side projects and you get
    energy from this.

  sec: 2477

  who: Pauline
- line: That's where the “independent” (indie) part comes into play. You don't you
    owe anything to anyone? You don't have funding, you don't have investors, so nobody's
    pushing you to actually work except for only yourself.
  sec: 2480

    of users – probably there would be some client support, and we would have to manage
    our time, but this is not our case. We'll see later for that. [chuckles]
  sec: 2500

  who: Pauline
- line: I saw a tweet from you – it was actually a reply. The tweet that you replied
    to was, “Do you have a list of micro SaaS ideas?” And you replied that “Of course,
    there are many on my list.” So maybe, can you tell us first of all, what is a
    micro SaaS (micro software as a service)? Is this what we discussed? All these
    things that you built are micro as software services projects?
  sec: 2519
  time: '41:59'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'AboutStartup.io: Blog Concept, Interviews, and Monetization Paths'
- line: Yeah. I don't know if the term “micro” is important but yeah, I have a lot
    of ideas. I have my Notion to-do list. Of course, I won't build them all. When
    I have an idea, I work on a project – if it works, that's cool, I can improve
    it. If it doesn't, I start a new one, as I said. Now I'm working on some Twitter
    tools to make better analytics of your data. This is one I will launch as well.
    There are other ones on my list. I won't tell you what they are, not because it's
    confidential, but because I don't know if I will launch them one day. There is
    one actually that I can tell you about, which is blog creation.
  sec: 2547
  time: '42:27'
  who: Pauline
- line: It's called AboutStartup.io. This is very new. I just launched today, you
    probably see it in your tweets. The idea of it is – I wanted to interview other
    people that do indie hacking, or that build some companies, even if it's a small
    one, in order to inspire people. Also to say that there are not only successful
    people – it takes time and that's okay. When you start doing indie hacking, you
    shouldn't think “Okay, I will be a millionaire at the end of the year or something
    like that.” I think this is not the way to think because it's very hard. So I
    want to share some stories. This is something I wanted to do for a long time,
    so I just started.
  sec: 2547
  time: '42:27'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay, great. I’m looking forward to seeing this. This is a blog, right? [Pauline
    agrees] It's a website with a bunch of articles. It's not a software as a service
    thing?
  sec: 2675
  time: '44:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. It’s not.
  sec: 2687
  time: '44:47'
  who: Pauline
- line: So how can you earn money with this? Or is it more like just a fun project?
  sec: 2692
  time: '44:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's a fun project, but there are some people that earn money with blogs.
    There are several ways to do this. Imagine you have a blog where you talk about
    cars a lot. You can find a sponsor who will say, “Okay, I'm a car manufacturer.
    Can you write an article about my car?” That's a way of earning money. You can
    also monetize with ads and also with affiliation. That's a few ways.
  sec: 2698
  time: '44:58'
  who: Pauline
- header: 'Idea Generation: Frustration-Led Problems and Opportunity Sourcing'
- line: I see. Interesting. You said you don't want to talk about particular ideas
    that you have on your list and that's understandable. But maybe you can tell us
    how these ideas ended up on your list? Where do you get ideas from?
  sec: 2739
  time: '45:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so sometimes I'm trying to do something and say, “Oh, but this doesn't
    work well. How can I do something else?” Exactly like Cryptopy – I was on my computer
    looking at the chart and said, “Oh, this takes me too much time. How can I reduce
    this time?” I Googled it and didn't find any solution to fix my problem, so I
    said, “Okay, it doesn't exist. I will build it.” It’s also because I have the
    skills to do it. I mean, if I don't like the bread in my city, I won't create
    my own bread. [chuckles]
  sec: 2753
  time: '45:53'
  who: Pauline
- line: I see. So it mainly comes from your frustration or from the limitations of
    other tools. There is a tool that solves a problem, but it doesn't solve it in
    a way that you want and you say, “Okay, it's possible to make it better.” And
    you take note of this idea.
  sec: 2796
  time: '46:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. That's exactly what we did. The exception is for Unreal Me.
    It was really just because we saw other competitors that validated the idea, so
    we said, “Okay, maybe we can earn some money with it.” So that was different.
  sec: 2819
  time: '46:59'
  who: Pauline
- line: What are your plans? You said that you are about to launch this AboutStartup.io
    today, and then you have a Twitter analytics tool. What else should we expect
    from you in the future? Or you don't know yet?
  sec: 2838
  time: '47:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know, it depends. Because I like to share my results and not only
    “Hey, I'm successful!” but also, as I said, you have to show failure. I like to
    be transparent. While doing this, there was one person that contacted me and said,
    “Okay, about Cryptopy – I have a crypto audience. Can you create a Telegram for
    me, so that every time I trade, my audience sees what I bought or sold?” So this
    is the kind of opportunity that you don't expect at first, but this happened.
  sec: 2856
  time: '47:36'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay, interesting. What you’re saying is that you plan to work on your existing
    projects a little bit and then maybe there are some new ideas that you will have,
    and maybe you will launch them too. Right?
  sec: 2908
  time: '48:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I think it's very common that you have an idea and then you start to
    build it and say, “Okay, maybe I can do it differently.” And so you change your
    mind.
  sec: 2923
  time: '48:43'
  who: Pauline
- header: 'Idea Validation: Competitor Scan, Skills Check, and Build Criteria'

    haven't started working on yet. How do you go from this idea on the list to actually
    launching it? What are the steps?
  sec: 2934
  time: '48:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: First, I talk with my friends and we evaluate if there is really a need –
    if there are a lot of competitors, for example. We don't want to build just to
    build. Again, except maybe for Unreal Me because we could build it very quickly.
    So we evaluate and we say “Okay, do I need this? Yes. Will other people need it?
    Probably. Do we have the skills to do it? Yes. Okay, then we can build it.” That's
    also what happened with the Twitter tools. I tweet a lot and I saw that the Twitter
    analytics tool is very bad. At least I don't like it. [chuckles] It's helpful,
    but there is a lot of information I can’t get from it. I wanted my own tool. I
    know some other tools exist, but they all have different offers. I think I offer
    something different, at least I believe in my own way.

    I had the account for a few years, but I didn't use Twitter before. I guess one
    day I subscribed and never came back. This summer, I had an interesting conversation
    with someone who told me about personal branding. He created some companies too
    and he told me, “You create one project and you create an Instagram for this project.
    Then you create another project, you can put the trust of your audience that you’ve
    built for the first one. You want continuity. The common thing between all your
    projects is you, actually.” I said, “Okay, that's true. I want to share with people
    what I do.” I do data, I do indie hacking, so I talk about both and it seems that
    people like it.

  who: Pauline
- line: Okay. What does he do?
  sec: 3294
  time: '54:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: He’s an inspiration. He is an indie hacker that built around 70 projects.
    A few of them became successful. He built one project that is called interior.ai
    – it's a website where you can generate a new interior for yourself using AI.

- line: Interior dot IO, you said, right?
  sec: 3334

  who: Alexey
- line: I'm not sure about the link.
  sec: 3338
  time: '55:38'
  who: Pauline
- line: Maybe just send us the link later.
  sec: 3340
  time: '55:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So what it does is – you send a picture of your apartment and it generates
    new decorations. This is the one I was talking about earlier, where I got the
    inspiration for Unreal Me. He was the one, when I saw his project was working
    I said, “Okay, it works for him. Why don't I try it?” So I tried it. I wasn't
    as successful, of course. He has a big audience, and he was the first and he did
    it very well.
  sec: 3344
  time: '55:44'
  who: Pauline
- line: I guess also for Peter, maybe it wasn't successful from the first attempt.
    It probably took a few trials before something took off.
  sec: 3382
  time: '56:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. He shared a list recently – I think it was 70 projects that he did. I
    think he makes a living from four of them. Maybe five? I don't know.

    if you're a bad archer?
  sec: 3408
  time: '56:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think the more you build, the more chances you have to be successful.

- header: 'Recommended Resources: Data Sense and AboutStartup.io'
- line: Do you have any book or other resources that you can recommend to the listeners?
  sec: 3430
  time: '57:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: About data, there are two words that I really love – Data Sense. It's a blog
    where they share a lot of use cases of data, something I read really frequently.
    But I don't read much. I don't have a lot of books to recommend. If you want inspiration
    about indie hacking, of course, AboutStartup.io is very cool. [chuckless]
  sec: 3438
  time: '57:18'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay. So that's the resource you recommend to check. I guess when we release
    this recording as a podcast, AboutStartup.io will already be live. We will also
    include the link in the description. That's the resource you should go to if you
    want to learn more about indie hacking. Cool. Anything else you wanted to talk
    about but we forgot to mention?

- header: Episode Wrap-Up and Final Thoughts
- line: I think we talked about pretty much everything.
  sec: 3499
  time: '58:19'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay. I guess we should be wrapping up. Thanks, Pauline. It was a pleasure
    having you here, finally. We postponed the stream a couple of times – finally
    we met. We had some technical difficulties, so this time we used StreamYard. The
    important thing is that we actually did this finally. Thanks for joining us today.
    Thanks for sharing your experience. As you said, it's very important to share
    the experience even though some things didn't work, maybe in the way you expected
    them to work, but it's still important to share this. So thanks for doing this.

    podcast to be honest.

- line: Ah, that's cool. So you will remember this.

  sec: 3555
  time: '59:15'
  who: Pauline
- line: Okay, second one. Okay, then. Thanks, Pauline. Thanks, everyone, and see you
    soon.
