  who: Alexey
- line: Do not forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel so you stay up to date with
    future streams. We also have an amazing Slack community where you can hang out
    with other data enthusiasts. During today's interview, you can ask questions using
    the pinned link in the live chat. Click the link, submit your question, and we
    will cover it later in the interview. That is the usual intro.
  sec: 5
  time: 0:05
  who: Alexey
- line: Now I will stop sharing my screen and open the questions we prepared. There
    is a new Zoom feature called AI Companion that I have not used for a podcast before.
    I am giving it a try to see how well it generates a summary. Anusha, if you are
    ready, we can start.
  sec: 44
  time: 0:44
  who: Alexey
- line: This week we will talk about how AI is transforming the finance function.
    We will discuss how it helps teams move beyond spreadsheets and slow systems toward
    faster data driven decision making. Our guest today is the co founder of Auralytix.
  sec: 71
  time: '1:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: How do you pronounce it? Could you say it again?
  sec: 83
  time: '1:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Auralytix comes from Aura meaning gold, but also aura as in the spiritual
    field around a person. It is an AI driven finance platform that gives CFOs and
    finance teams clarity and speed without adding complexity. Anusha’s work focuses
    on using AI to augment, not automate, finance and combines advanced analytics
    with compliance, explainability, and trust. Welcome to our podcast.
  sec: 101
  time: '1:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. Thank you Alexey.
  sec: 137
  time: '2:17'
  who: Anusha
- header: From accounting roots to auditing at Deloitte and Paraxel
- line: Before we talk about AI and finance, I want to hear your story. I enjoy learning
    how founders start their journey. Running this community is also a kind of business,
    so it is always interesting for me to hear how people make the leap from a stable
    job to founding a company. Tell us about your career so far.
  sec: 142
  time: '2:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I am Anusha, based in Hamburg, Germany, originally from India. I am a Chartered
    Global Management Accountant from the UK. I worked at Deloitte and Parexel in
    multiple roles. I started my career as an auditor, doing internal and sometimes
    statutory or external audits.
  sec: 181
  time: '3:01'
  who: Anusha
- line: What do auditors actually do? I worked at a company where people in suits
    would show up, usually from Amsterdam for some reason, and they were auditors
    from Deloitte. I knew they worked long hours and earned good money, but I never
    really understood what they do.
  sec: 218
  time: '3:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Auditors examine a company’s processes, financial data, non financial data,
    and operational data. Their role is to reassure authorities that the company is
    paying taxes correctly, following regulations, and not committing fraud. Someone
    independent must confirm that everything is compliant. Internal auditors help
    management ensure operations run smoothly, and external auditors, like Deloitte
    or PwC, verify processes, test data, and issue audited financial statements.
  sec: 255
  time: '4:15'
  who: Anusha
- line: It is not a value adding role in the usual sense, but it gives a holistic
    perspective of whether a business is working properly. It brings high trust for
    the government and stakeholders because they know the company follows compliance
    requirements.
  sec: 328
  time: '5:28'
  who: Anusha
- line: It must be a difficult job because you have to check all the books and make
    sure people are not hiding anything.
  sec: 345
  time: '5:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, and sometimes people get offended when you ask certain questions. You
    might face situations where someone with thirty years of experience wonders why
    a young auditor is questioning them. But the best part of the role is that you
    see many businesses and develop a broad understanding of processes. You learn
    to detect bottlenecks and identify what is not working well.
  sec: 359
  time: '5:59'
  who: Anusha
- line: It is also very labor intensive. You travel a lot, sometimes to remote places,
    especially for manufacturing or construction audits. You might stay there for
    months. It is great experience but can also cause burnout.
  sec: 443
  time: '7:23'
  who: Anusha
- header: Moving to Germany and pivoting into corporate finance
- line: Did you do this in the UK or India?
  sec: 500
  time: '8:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: My qualification is from the UK, but I worked as an auditor in India.
  sec: 505
  time: '8:25'
  who: Anusha
- line: So you did this for a while. What did you do next?
  sec: 511
  time: '8:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: After auditing, I moved into a corporate finance role as a financial controller.
    A controller sits on the other side of the table from the auditor. I moved to
    Germany for personal reasons, but getting an auditing job without German language
    skills is very difficult. You need at least C1 German, which takes time to achieve.
    So I chose the next best option, a controller role with a specialization in SOX,
    Sarbanes Oxley. I found exactly that type of job.
  sec: 518
  time: '8:38'
  who: Anusha
- line: Interesting. How is your German now?
  sec: 574
  time: '9:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is good. My team consisted mostly of amazing women who did not speak much
    English, so they made sure I learned German quickly. Within one to one and a half
    years, I became reasonably fluent.
  sec: 579
  time: '9:39'
  who: Anusha
- line: Do you think your German level now would allow you to work as an auditor?
  sec: 604
  time: '10:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, in conversations it should be enough. I am not sure about exams, but
    I can communicate well.
  sec: 609
  time: '10:09'
  who: Anusha
- line: I got a B2 certificate a year ago. Speaking is one thing, passing a test is
    another. Even with the certificate, I sometimes freeze in real situations.
  sec: 631
  time: '10:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is the same for me. I also have B2, but certificates matter less than being
    able to speak, understand, and communicate. You will improve with time.
  sec: 658
  time: '10:58'
  who: Anusha
- line: How long have you been in Germany?
  sec: 679
  time: '11:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Since around 2018, so about seven years.
  sec: 686
  time: '11:26'
  who: Anusha
- header: The data struggle in strategic finance and the need for change
- line: You were working in corporate finance as a financial controller. At what point
    did you decide to go solo?
  sec: 710
  time: '11:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: After the controller role, I moved into a larger role as lead finance or finance
    business partner for Central Europe at a UK based company. It was more strategic
    than controlling. Even though the role was strategic, I still spent about 80 percent
    of my time not analyzing data but chasing it.
  sec: 718
  time: '11:58'
  who: Anusha
- line: Every month felt like Groundhog Day. I waited for updates, joined meetings
    to ask what was happening, and stitched together numbers from different spreadsheets.
    I always wondered whether the data was complete or current. The workload was fine,
    but the dependence on other people just to get data was frustrating.
  sec: 757
  time: '12:37'
  who: Anusha
- header: 'How Auralytix was born: bridging AI and financial compliance'
- line: Finance had become disconnected from what was really happening in operations.
    Even with modern ERPs, CRMs, and BI tools, finance was still reactive, never ahead.
    Around 2023, I read about Databricks and how it unified data across silos so companies
    could move from chaos to insight. It resonated with me because finance faces the
    same fragmentation but with stricter compliance requirements.
  sec: 800
  time: '13:20'
  who: Anusha
- line: I thought that if Databricks could transform how enterprises use data, there
    should be something similar designed for finance, but with compliance and audit
    trails in mind. When I did not find a solution like that, I decided to create
    one. Although I am not an engineer, the last two years changed the way I think.
    I now understand data perspectives and finance pain points. That led to Auralytix.
  sec: 851
  time: '14:11'
  who: Anusha
- line: You mentioned ERPs. Coming from software engineering, I sometimes had to interact
    with finance systems for procurement. We used a system called Coupa, and as an
    end user, it was painful. The finance team had to write long manuals just so we
    could request and pay for tools. What is the state of ERPs now, and what exactly
    is an ERP?
  sec: 918
  time: '15:18'
  who: Alexey
- header: Why ERP systems fail finance teams and how spreadsheets fill the gap
- line: ERP stands for Enterprise Resource Planning. A company has many processes
    such as finance, procurement, sales, operations, manufacturing, supply chain,
    and logistics. The data is everywhere, and you need one platform to integrate
    it so you can build reports and connect the dots. That is the purpose of an ERP.
  sec: 1035
  time: '17:15'
  who: Anusha
- line: In reality, ERPs rarely achieve this. They are black box systems with huge
    manuals and require expertise to make even small changes. This creates heavy dependence
    on spreadsheets, and that is where problems begin.
  sec: 1073
  time: '17:53'
  who: Anusha
- line: Let me clarify with a simple example. I run a small company selling shoes.
    Every sale must be recorded somewhere. Eventually, all this data should end up
    in the ERP so auditors or finance people can see our spending, revenue, and number
    of shoes sold. Then someone in a strategic role can pull the numbers and guide
    the company. Why does this not work in practice?
  sec: 1130
  time: '18:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: ERP systems have rigid, standardized structures. They are one size fits all
    with small customizations. For a shoe company, management needs insights such
    as which models sell well, which sizes, which colors, who buys them, and which
    trends are emerging. Before Christmas, which items should be stocked, and during
    Black Friday, which items should be discounted. These are strategic questions.
  sec: 1185
  time: '19:45'
  who: Anusha
- line: If you open the ERP, you will not find a report answering any of these questions.
    ERPs are built for compliance and storing data, not for analyzing it. That is
    why spreadsheets, BI tools, and many specialized systems like Coupa exist.
  sec: 1248
  time: '20:48'
  who: Anusha
- line: For a CFO, data is scattered across many tools. At a single moment, it is
    hard to understand what is happening in the company. By the time controllers or
    analysts gather all the data and turn it into insights, the opportunity to act
    is gone. The Black Friday sale is over, or Christmas is over, and the company
    has already fallen behind competitors.
  sec: 1300
  time: '21:40'
  who: Anusha
- line: Enterprises win because they can afford sophisticated tools. They use them
    to create demand, refine strategy, increase profits, and act faster. But for small
    and medium sized businesses, even up to 500 million euros in revenue, it is difficult
    to understand these patterns.
  sec: 1342
  time: '22:22'
  who: Anusha
- line: The complexity is high. As I understood, correct me if I am wrong, the data
    is in the ERP, which is the database where we record all transactions. We keep
    an eye on stock and see our inventory. But this is not enough because the data
    is just sitting there and it is not easy to extract. For that we need an analyst
    who can set up a process to get data out and create a dashboard or report so that
    before Black Friday we know which shoes we need to discount.
  sec: 1350
  time: '22:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: We need an analyst and perhaps a technical person who can pull the data and
    make this report. Is this how it works
  sec: 1370
  time: '22:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is not only that, it is also about incomplete data. The systems are rigid
    and even small changes require an army of consultants to update the ERP. These
    consultants are expensive, so companies accept limitations and switch to manual
    processing. It is not only about hiring analysts to extract and transform data,
    but also about ERP rigidity where data is never complete. It is only in a fixed
    form.
  sec: 1377
  time: '22:57'
  who: Anusha
- line: So when I buy SAP or another ERP system, they have a fixed flow for entering
    data and defining what data we can enter. If I want to go outside the typical
    process I have problems. Some systems use visual basic or other languages for
    customization. But finance people are usually not developers and the software
    is not easy to deal with.
  sec: 1395
  time: '23:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Someone told me that if you want to make money as a developer you should become
    an SAP consultant.
  sec: 1405
  time: '23:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: I agree completely. This is the biggest gap I see. As a finance person you
    do not have the technical knowledge to transform your ideas into tools or data
    you want to use. That is where external consultants come in. Some are great but
    some just make money because you do not know how small changes cost a lot.
  sec: 1408
  time: '23:28'
  who: Anusha
- line: Companies spend enormous amounts of money. The problem does not stop after
    the first change. If you think one add-on will solve everything, it will not.
    The pace of business is fast and these tools do not have the same agility. They
    do not scale accordingly and that is why we need AI based ERPs and AI platforms
    that can run at the speed of business.
  sec: 1425
  time: '23:45'
  who: Anusha
- line: What do you mean by an AI ERP? Instead of explaining what I want, I talk to
    AI, formalize it, press enter and the AI system modifies my SAP form or whatever
    system I use. It adds an extra field or changes the workflow. Is this what you
    mean
  sec: 1442
  time: '24:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, something like that. We need a flexible system that can scale with the
    organization. I think this is the future. Because until now this has been the
    biggest pain.
  sec: 1452
  time: '24:12'
  who: Anusha
- header: The real cost of ERP rigidity and lessons from failed transformations
- line: Maybe I can give an example. In one company where I worked the board decided
    to change the ERP system. They thought it was the best ERP for manufacturing and
    project management. They invested around a million euros and with consultants
    implemented it in two years. But the data quality became so bad that we did not
    know what was happening.
  sec: 1471
  time: '24:31'
  who: Anusha
- line: Even operations people were frustrated. It went back to the board and they
    decided to switch again to another ERP system. This new system was three or four
    times more expensive. After a year we were in a better situation but still not
    at the level we expected. We started buying new add-ons because the ERP was missing
    functions.
  sec: 1492
  time: '24:52'
  who: Anusha
- line: This is how finance transformation projects go. More add-ons and more silos
    because the ERP does not solve everything. What we need is a system flexible and
    scalable enough to grow with the business. I think AI makes this possible.
  sec: 1516
  time: '25:16'
  who: Anusha
- line: You mentioned your personal experience where you adopted a new ERP system
    but after two years the data quality dropped and you had to switch again. Why
    did the quality drop Was it because the company changed but the processes in the
    ERP did not change, so people stopped entering data correctly Was the data entry
    process too complex and people were lazy to do it Why was there a drop in quality
  sec: 1531
  time: '25:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: There were multiple reasons. One reason was the way people entered data. Management
    needs many different perspectives from sales, purchasing and operations. Decisions
    depend on many data points and someone must input the data correctly so it can
    be converted into patterns. These patterns become insights for strategic decisions.
  sec: 1547
  time: '25:47'
  who: Anusha
- line: People did not know where to put the data because the ERP was rigid. You could
    only use the available fields. For strategy we could not understand what was going
    on. Let me give an example. Our company worked on contract basis. A major criteria
    to understand performance was contract renewals, new contracts and closed contracts.
  sec: 1570
  time: '26:10'
  who: Anusha
- line: This was basic information to understand where to focus and why customers
    were leaving. The system could not provide it because it was not built for that.
    It was an ERP for a trading company, not for project management or contract-based
    business. If systems are rigid you cannot get the data you want. You start using
    an Excel file again.
  sec: 1591
  time: '26:31'
  who: Anusha
- line: You fill Excel manually and one mistake breaks everything. Another example
    is fixed assets. The ERP did not even have a fixed assets module. All fixed assets
    and depreciation were in Excel. So you enter some data in ERP and extra data in
    Excel. You keep the link in your mind but it is easy to make mistakes when everything
    is manual.
  sec: 1612
  time: '26:52'
  who: Anusha
- line: There is also the issue of turnover. Accounting teams have high attrition.
    When someone leaves it is hard to replace them and by the time a new person comes
    the knowledge is gone. Then you hire a consultant to set everything up again.
    There is no continuity and no one knows where the Excel started.
  sec: 1636
  time: '27:16'
  who: Anusha
- line: People leave, new people join with no idea about the spreadsheet, so they
    create their own file with a different format. Then they leave and someone else
    creates another version. You end up with many Excel files and nobody knows how
    they work or what the current state is. Historical data becomes a mess.
  sec: 1656
  time: '27:36'
  who: Anusha
- line: For me it is interesting to know how this led you personally to think you
    can fix these problems. How did it happen for you What was the process Did you
    see that Databricks was doing this for analytics but nobody was doing it for finance
    and thought you could be the one How did the timeline look Because leaving a well
    paid role and taking the leap to start your own company is brave.
  sec: 1673
  time: '27:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is a good question. This happened around 2023 when I was frustrated with
    my work. We completed our ERP migration to a new tool and also had a consolidation
    system. In global companies you have a local ERP and on top of it a consolidation
    system.
  sec: 1692
  time: '28:12'
  who: Anusha
- line: A consolidation system gives management one single source of truth. Every
    country has a different way of putting accounts together, but for management everything
    must be uniform. Systems like SAP EPM, Tagetik or HFM are used for consolidation,
    budget and forecast. Budgeting and forecasting are strategic tasks.
  sec: 1711
  time: '28:31'
  who: Anusha
- line: You must understand data patterns, new customers, customer retention, suppliers
    and many considerations for forecasting sales, cost of sales, working capital
    and cash flow. You analyze everything, talk to many people and by the time you
    upload the data you have 20 to 30 versions of Excel sheets.
  sec: 1732
  time: '28:52'
  who: Anusha
- header: The hidden risks of spreadsheet dependency and knowledge loss
- line: In a meeting when someone asks why a specific product revenue changed you
    must go through all these Excel files. You spend so much time but still cannot
    answer exactly. This should be solved by proper processes. Around that time the
    first public version of ChatGPT came out. It was not great yet but I was a tech
    enthusiast.
  sec: 1750
  time: '29:10'
  who: Anusha
- line: I knew how the data looked, so I prepared a mockup file because I could not
    upload company data. I loaded it and asked AI to transform it and find patterns.
    It did surprisingly well. I would rate it maybe 55 or 60 out of 100 which already
    saved 60 percent of my time during tough budgeting periods.
  sec: 1770
  time: '29:30'
  who: Anusha
- line: I gave two different datasets, sales orders and data from another system,
    and asked it to build a bridge between them. It did well. It felt like magic.
    I wondered if it was real.
  sec: 1792
  time: '29:52'
  who: Anusha
- line: Did it write code or how was it doing this for you Was it code
  sec: 1800
  time: '30:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, mostly by writing code. I learned basic Python but before you could not
    just upload spreadsheets like now. Today you can upload the file to ChatGPT, see
    the code and look only at the final result. At that time you had to copy the code,
    execute it and prepare the environment. Installing Python is easy for technical
    people but not for many finance people.
  sec: 1802
  time: '30:02'
  who: Anusha
- line: This was based on many data points, and someone had to input them in a specific
    way so they could be converted into patterns and turned into insights. As a strategic
    role, you look at these insights and understand what is happening. You think about
    missing mitigation and how to deal with the situation. At that time people did
    not know where to put the data because the ERP system was rigid. You could not
    change anything and only saw the available fields where you entered the data.
  sec: 1804
  time: '30:04'
  who: Anusha
- line: For strategy, you still could not understand what was going on. For example,
    our company worked on a contract basis, so one of the major criteria to understand
    performance was the number of renewed contracts, new contracts and closed contracts.
    This basic information helped us understand where to concentrate and why people
    were leaving. But the system could not provide it because it was not built for
    that purpose. It was an ERP system for a trading company, not for project management
    or contract-based work.
  sec: 1826
  time: '30:26'
  who: Anusha
- line: If systems are rigid you cannot get data in the way you want, and then you
    start using an Excel file again. You fill the Excel file manually and one mistake
    can make everything wrong. This was one example. Our company was also heavy in
    fixed assets, and the ERP system did not even have a fixed assets module. All
    fixed assets and depreciation were in Excel.
  sec: 1852
  time: '30:52'
  who: Anusha
- line: You had the ERP for what it could handle, and an additional Excel spreadsheet
    for data without fields. You kept the link between ERP and spreadsheet in your
    mind. It was very easy to make mistakes when entering everything manually. It
    was not an ETL or automated process. Everything was manual and that was the biggest
    issue.
  sec: 1874
  time: '31:14'
  who: Anusha
- line: Accounting teams also have a high attrition rate. People leave quickly, and
    when someone leaves it is hard to replace them. There is a gap before a new person
    comes, and the knowledge leaves with them. Then you need a consultant to set things
    up again, and later another consultant when someone else leaves out of frustration.
    There is no continuity in the data.
  sec: 1893
  time: '31:33'
  who: Anusha
- line: Someone starts an Excel spreadsheet and leaves, and the new person has no
    idea about it. They start their own spreadsheet with a different format. Then
    they leave and another person starts yet another version. You end up with many
    Excel files. Nobody knows how they work, what the current state is, or how to
    get historical data. It becomes a mess.
  sec: 1915
  time: '31:55'
  who: Anusha
- line: For me it is interesting to know how you saw all these problems and thought
    you could fix them. How did this happen for you? What was the process? You mentioned
    Databricks, and you thought Databricks does this for data analytics but nobody
    does this for finance, so maybe you could be the person who tries. How did this
    work for you?
  sec: 1939
  time: '32:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Also, leaving a company and a well-paid role to start your own company is
    brave. I want to know more about that.
  sec: 1965
  time: '32:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is a good question. This happened around 2023 when I was very frustrated
    with my work. We completed our ERP migration to a new tool and also had another
    consolidation system. In global companies you have a local ERP system and on top
    of it a consolidation system. A consolidation system provides management with
    one single source of truth.
  sec: 1980
  time: '33:00'
  who: Anusha
- line: Every country records accounts differently, but management needs a unified
    top-level view. Systems like SAP EPM, Tagetik or HFM are consolidation tools for
    management reporting. You do forecasting and budgeting at the consolidation level,
    not at the local level. Budgeting and forecasting are strategic tasks and you
    need to understand data patterns. You think about new customers, existing customers
    and suppliers.
  sec: 2005
  time: '33:25'
  who: Anusha
- line: There are many considerations when forecasting sales, cost of sales, working
    capital and cash flow. You analyze everything and speak to many people. By the
    time you upload the data, you have 20 to 30 versions of Excel sheets. When you
    sit in a meeting and someone asks why a particular service revenue changed, you
    go through all the versions to answer. You spend so much time and still cannot
    explain exactly why.
  sec: 2030
  time: '33:50'
  who: Anusha
- line: This should be solved by proper processes. Around that time the first public
    version of ChatGPT came out. It was not great yet, but I was a tech enthusiast.
    I prepared a dummy mockup file because I could not upload company data. I loaded
    the mock data and asked AI to transform it and understand the patterns.
  sec: 2055
  time: '34:15'
  who: Anusha
- line: It did surprisingly well. I would give it around 55 or 60 out of 100, which
    already meant saving about 60 percent of my time during budgeting and forecasting.
    Then I provided two different sets of data, like sales orders and Datar data,
    and asked it to bridge them. It did well and felt like magic. I thought it was
    amazing that something could do this.
  sec: 2078
  time: '34:38'
  who: Anusha
- line: Was it writing code for you? How was it doing the work? Was it generating
    code?
  sec: 2102
  time: '35:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it was generating code. I learned basic Python and it was mostly writing
    code. Today you can upload spreadsheets directly and get analysis without looking
    at code. You see the result and adjust it. Before, tools were not available, so
    you needed to run the code and prepare the environment.
  sec: 2110
  time: '35:10'
  who: Anusha
- line: For technical people installing Python is easy, but for someone in finance
    it is not. I was lucky because my husband is a software engineer. He knows Python
    and helped me install open-source models. He also shared videos so I could learn.
    At the time I had my baby and was on maternity leave.
  sec: 2132
  time: '35:32'
  who: Anusha
- line: So again you have systems like SAP, EPM, Tagetic or HFM. These are consolidation
    tools for management reporting. You do your forecast, budget and everything at
    the consolidation system level, not at the local level. When I used to work on
    budgeting and forecasting, it was always a strategic task, not a day-to-day task.
    You have to understand the patterns in the data.
  sec: 2154
  time: '35:54'
  who: Anusha
- line: You need to understand how you will get new customers, how many customers
    will stay with you and which suppliers you need to take care of. There are multiple
    considerations when you forecast sales, cost of sales, working capital and cash
    flow. You do everything, analyze everything and speak to hundreds of people. By
    the time you upload the data, you have 20 to 30 versions of Excel sheets. When
    you sit in a meeting and someone asks why you changed a particular product’s service
    revenue, you have to search through all these Excel sheets.
  sec: 2176
  time: '36:16'
  who: Anusha
- line: You have already spent so much time, yet you still cannot explain exactly
    why you did something. This should be solved by better processes. Around that
    time the first public version of ChatGPT came out. It was not great yet, but I
    was already a bit of a tech enthusiast. I knew how the data looked, so I prepared
    a dummy mockup file because I could not upload my company’s data.
  sec: 2223
  time: '37:03'
  who: Anusha
- header: Experimenting with ChatGPT and coding the first AI finance prototype
- line: I prepared mockup data for some XYZ company and loaded it into ChatGPT. I
    asked AI to transform it and understand the patterns. It did pretty well from
    my perspective. I would give it 55 or 60 points out of 100.
  sec: 2250
  time: '37:30'
  who: Anusha
- line: From my perspective that already meant saving 60 percent of my time, especially
    during the difficult forecasting and budgeting hours. Then I gave it two different
    sets of data from two different sources, like sales orders data and data records.
    I asked it to form a bridge between the two and it did really well. I felt it
    was like magic at that moment. I thought someone can actually do this.
  sec: 2286
  time: '38:06'
  who: Anusha
- line: Was it writing code for you? Or how was it doing it? Was it code?
  sec: 2334
  time: '38:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I learned basic Python and it was mostly writing code I would say. Before,
    you could not just upload spreadsheets to ChatGPT and get an analysis. Now you
    can see the code if you want, but you can also look only at the final result.
    You can give feedback like this is not what I meant or this is good.
  sec: 2340
  time: '39:00'
  who: Anusha
- line: So you do not even need to know Python now, but before the tool did not exist.
    You needed to get the code, copy it and execute it. You also had to prepare the
    environment. For someone technical, installing Python is easy, but for someone
    in the finance department it is very hard.
  sec: 2371
  time: '39:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was lucky because my husband is a software engineer. He works in a different
    tech stack but he knows Python. He helped me install an open source model and
    he shared videos so I could learn. At that time I also had my baby and I was on
    maternity leave.
  sec: 2399
  time: '39:59'
  who: Anusha
- line: I used that time really well to learn everything, including some technical
    skills. By the time white coding started, it opened a new world for me. As a nontechnical
    person, with the help of white coding I could do whatever I wanted. It was a real
    wow moment for me.
  sec: 2427
  time: '40:27'
  who: Anusha
- line: That is cool. What did you use? Was it just ChatGPT or did you also start
    using tools like Cursor?
  sec: 2455
  time: '40:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I used ChatGPT, Cursor and Lovable. At that time Lovable was still very small.
    I met someone who told me they had released version one and I think I was the
    first non-technical user who tried it. I also used Cursor. For UI and UX I used
    Framer and started preparing mockups.
  sec: 2462
  time: '41:02'
  who: Anusha
- line: Can you say it again
  sec: 2488
  time: '41:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Framer is really good for understanding UI and UX. When I want to understand
    how my UI may look, I usually ask Lovable to design it and it creates a clickable
    mockup. It helps me see whether this is how I imagine the idea or if I want to
    iterate. Then I iterate directly in Lovable and ask it to place elements in different
    positions. It does not always do the best job because it needs to change the code,
    so I thought maybe there are better solutions focused more on the design stage
    than on the coding stage.
  sec: 2493
  time: '41:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe Framer is the answer. I need to check it. Thanks for sharing that.
  sec: 2500
  time: '41:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: What I used to do is first put my idea on paper because I am a pen and paper
    person. I drew how I would feel comfortable using any tool and where each element
    should be. Then I designed it in Framer and sent the Framer screenshot to Lovable.
    Lovable translated it into UI and UX. That worked quite well.
  sec: 2505
  time: '41:45'
  who: Anusha
- line: And you figured all this out by yourself?
  sec: 2512
  time: '41:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: I figured out everything by myself with no help from anyone. After I met Dimma
    and showed him my prototype, he told me it was already a product and that we did
    not need to build anything from scratch.
  sec: 2518
  time: '41:58'
  who: Anusha
- line: So Dimma is your co-founder?
  sec: 2586
  time: '43:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, Dimma is my co-founder.
  sec: 2592
  time: '43:12'
  who: Anusha
- line: Maybe tell us how this started. You had an idea, you built a prototype, and
    you believed you could transform the way things were done. What exactly did you
    build in this mockup before looking for co-founders?
  sec: 2592
  time: '43:12'
  who: Alexey
- header: Identifying finance’s biggest pain points through user research
- line: I started with identifying finance’s biggest pain points through user research
    and surveying. I knew my own pain points as a head of finance and as a finance
    business partner, but I needed to check whether others had the same issues or
    if it was only my case. I needed this understanding before making any decisions
    about leaving my job or switching roles. So I started surveying people in my field.
  sec: 2614
  time: '43:34'
  who: Anusha
- line: I have many friends in finance who work in different roles, from accountants
    and analysts to managers, senior managers and CFOs. I interviewed them with simple
    questions about what they do in real life as accountants or controllers or CFOs.
    I asked them to walk me through their typical day and tell me their biggest one
    or two pain points. I asked why those problems happen from their perspective and
    what they would solve first if given a magic wizard. These were basic friendly
    questions.
  sec: 2640
  time: '44:00'
  who: Anusha
- line: I interviewed many people and 70 percent gave me three big points that were
    common across groups. When I asked accountants, one common point appeared. When
    I asked controllers, one common point appeared. From this I understood there were
    three major pain points that needed to be solved. Then I created mockups for these
    three.
  sec: 2697
  time: '44:57'
  who: Anusha
- line: What were the problems?
  sec: 2730
  time: '45:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first was the reconciliations problem, which takes away 50 to 60 percent
    of an average accountant’s time. I transformed reconciliations into a tool that
    takes data from different sources, interprets how it looks and produces an output.
    Once it is done it has to go back into the ERP system without manual intervention.
    So I built a prototype showing how this could work.
  sec: 2736
  time: '45:36'
  who: Anusha
- line: The second prototype was consolidation. Management wants to see consolidated
    reports at the top level and every entity uploads data from around the world.
    There are many problems in this process because the tools are rigid and not scalable,
    and the scalable ones are very expensive. I explored how to solve this.
  sec: 2778
  time: '46:18'
  who: Anusha
- line: The third problem was the most common among all finance directors and CFOs
    I spoke to, and it was the problem of converting data into insights. I faced the
    same challenge in my strategic role. When I created this mockup and later the
    prototype, this was the one everyone loved. Out of the three, we decided to start
    with this one because you cannot develop everything at once.
  sec: 2813
  time: '46:53'
  who: Anusha
- header: Empowering finance teams with AI-driven, real-time decision insights
- line: How does it look? Do you upload a bunch of files and it tells you what is
    interesting?
  sec: 2844
  time: '47:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: It connects to your ERP and takes data from your CRM systems, expense tools
    and T and E systems. It pulls the key data, interprets it and surfaces insights.
    The goal is not to duplicate data but to make existing systems finally usable
    for decision making. That is why I call it augmenting the stack, not automating
    the stack. One example use case is forecasting.
  sec: 2856
  time: '47:36'
  who: Anusha
- line: Let us take the shoes example. Suppose Alex forecasted that he would sell
    one million units worth of shoes in a month. In the middle of the month the AI
    sees that only 100,000 have been sold. It then checks the order pipeline in the
    CRM system to see if there are orders to be converted. If there are none it checks
    the invoicing module to see if anything is ready to be invoiced.
  sec: 2896
  time: '48:16'
  who: Anusha
- line: It also checks manufacturing stages. Then it gives you an insight saying you
    have a risk of not meeting your forecast because nothing is in the sales pipeline
    or invoicing stage. It warns you about the potential impact on cash flow and working
    capital. That is what an insight looks like.
  sec: 2936
  time: '48:56'
  who: Anusha
- line: How does the system know what to look for? Do you define it using your domain
    knowledge?
  sec: 2980
  time: '49:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. We have an onboarding process to understand the context of the company
    because every company is different. We learn what the company does, its revenue
    sources and whether external data like FX or raw material prices affects it. We
    identify competitors and other context. Then we understand the company’s pain
    points and train the AI to look for those patterns and deliver outputs.
  sec: 2987
  time: '49:47'
  who: Anusha
- header: Developing an entrepreneurial mindset through strategy and learning
- line: When you were telling your story it seemed you understood what you were doing
    from the beginning. You had an idea and wanted to check whether it was relevant.
    You wanted to help people solve their problems rather than blindly building something
    and hoping it would work. Did you know how to do this? Where did the knowledge
    come from? Did you study business?
  sec: 3059
  time: '50:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: CGMA is a chartered global management accountant qualification, one of the
    highest in finance for management roles. You learn strategic management there.
    Surveying is also important within companies, especially in change management,
    to understand what to change, how to change and when to change. It is a powerful
    tool to see things from employees’ or the organization’s perspective. For me it
    feels natural.
  sec: 3093
  time: '51:33'
  who: Anusha
- line: Before even thinking about starting a company, I researched and listened to
    many podcasts. Thanks to people like you who create amazing podcasts, I gained
    a holistic view of whether such a tool is possible and whether the technology
    is ready. I also learned what the biggest failures and challenges are for founders.
    Many founders said they missed understanding market signals or built tools for
    themselves instead of real users.
  sec: 3153
  time: '52:33'
  who: Anusha
- line: That happens to many developers. We solve our own problem but nobody else
    needs it. So podcasts helped you avoid that.
  sec: 3209
  time: '53:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes exactly. That was one part of how I started the journey. After that it
    is a mix of gut-based and data-based decisions. You look at who is doing what
    in the market, how you can be different and what your unique selling point could
    be. When the time comes you need to clearly explain that. That is where the idea
    of surveying came from.
  sec: 3233

  sec: 3271
  time: '54:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I listened to Y Combinator podcasts which are very good, especially founder-to-founder.
    On the tech side I listened to Prediction Machines by Ajay Agrawal and Joshua
    Gans. On the human side I love The Fearless Organization by Amy Edmondson because
    it is about creating psychological safety, which is relevant for finance teams
    who fear being replaced by AI.
  sec: 3277
  time: '54:37'
  who: Anusha
- line: I also love Naval Ravikant for unit economics and strategy. And of course
    DataTalks.Club to understand conversations about data and how you transform data
    into insights. I have listened to your podcast too. They are very pleasant to
    hear.
  sec: 3321
  time: '55:21'
  who: Anusha
- line: Last question before we finish. How did you meet Dmitri? He is a friend of
    mine. He lives in Berlin and you live in Hamburg. How did that happen?
  sec: 3351
  time: '55:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: We met some years ago but did not know much about each other then. He was
    already a founder of another company because he is a serial founder. I met him
    at a meetup. Later when I was searching for a co-founder there was a co-founder
    connect event in Berlin about half a year ago. We met again there.
  sec: 3368
  time: '56:08'
  who: Anusha
- line: We talked and I told him about the idea. He said he was also looking for an
    opportunity. He is great in AI and ML and MCPs. We immediately clicked and decided
    to start. He already had something in mind related to using AI for finance, though
    from a slightly different angle.
  sec: 3407

  sec: 3468
  time: '57:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is called SIBB Co-Founder Meet. You register and they run an algorithm
    based on questions about what you want in a co-founder. It suggests around five
    to ten people you can meet. Then you meet them and talk.
  sec: 3474
  time: '57:54'
  who: Anusha
- line: The algorithm worked well for me because I met the right person. I know some
    programs where you give equity to the school, but this one was free. Before meeting
    Dimma I met another guy at a hackathon. My suggestion for non-technical people
    who want to meet technical people is to go to hackathons. Do not worry if you
    are non-technical. Many great developers would love to talk and transform ideas
    into products.
  sec: 3500
  time: '58:20'
  who: Anusha
- line: We have to wrap up. I really enjoyed this conversation. It is always interesting
    to talk to people who decide to start something on their own. I did not even notice
    how time passed but we have to finish.
  sec: 3594
  time: '59:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Before we end, do you have any course, video or book that you would recommend
    that had an impact on you when starting a company or deciding on your idea?
  sec: 3612
  time: '1:00:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. One book I loved is The Almanac of Naval Ravikant. It is great. The podcasts
    I mentioned also helped me a lot.
  sec: 3638
  time: '1:00:38'
  who: Anusha
- line: To develop an entrepreneurial mindset, the famous book Rich Dad Poor Dad also
    helped me. It changes your mindset from being an employee to being an entrepreneur.
    It transformed how I think.
  sec: 3659

    book.
  sec: 3698
  time: '1:01:38'

    thinks like an employee. There is probably an audio version. It is very famous.
