short: From Academia to Data Analytics and Engineering
title: From Academia to Data Analytics and Engineering
transcript:
- line: So this week we'll talk about becoming a data engineer – a data engineer or
    analyst – and we have a special guest today, Gloria. Gloria works as a business
    data analyst at ICE. I don't know if I pronounced the name correctly. Is it ICE?
    Like ice cube and ice cream. Right. Before working at ICE, she was a researcher
    and at some point, she decided to change her career, which is when she enrolled
    in a data science bootcamp. She will probably tell us more about that today. So,
    Gloria, welcome to our event.
  sec: 118
  time: '1:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Many thanks for having me.
  sec: 151
  time: '2:31'
  who: Gloria
- header: Gloria’s background
- line: Before we go into today’s main topic, let's start with your background. Can
    you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 154
  time: '2:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I originally studied biology and psychology in the United States and
    then decided to continue that track by pursuing a Master's in neuroscience here
    in Europe. After my Master's, I decided to join a research group here in Germany,
    in another city in Magdeburg. I worked in that laboratory for three years. The
    research I concentrated on was examining the effects of dopamine on long term
    potentiation, or how memory is formed, essentially.
  sec: 161
  time: '2:41'
  who: Gloria
- line: Throughout my time there, I did realize that after a while, I did have more
    of a passion for the technical stuff rather than the theoretical, scientific,
    or biological background of my research. Also, while I was there, in my last year,
    I had to establish a technique and I had to build a lot of my own apparatuses
    of reconfigure machinery, and one of the things also was to learn how to program
    in the C language, so that I could do some data analysis. And that part, I really
    enjoyed very much and I realized that this is what I really wanted to do in the
    long term and that in academic research fields, this was not like so much a possibility
    for me. I wanted to go to a field where I have more possibilities, so I decided
    at the end of my third year contract, to not renew it, and then to start doing
    the career transition.
  sec: 161
  time: '2:41'
  who: Gloria
- line: I eventually found this data science boot camp here in Berlin called Spiced
    Academy and I did that for three months. I really did enjoy it. I learned so much
    more than I had anticipated. Then I did the typical job hunt – you know, how everyone
    does – and eventually landed my spot at the company ICE as a business data analyst.
  sec: 161
  time: '2:41'
  who: Gloria
- line: Interesting story. You said you needed to configure this machinery and tried
    something in the C language. What did this machinery look like? Is it something
    that you attach to the brain or? Not the brain, but your head I mean. [chuckles]
  sec: 275
  time: '4:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. so I actually… Oh, no, no. [chuckles] I mean, I've done that before as
    well. But this one is essentially about – I had to work with animal tissue samples.
    I essentially had to harvest brain slices, unfortunately, from mice. And then
    I would have to place it in this massive microscope apparatus and hook up this
    little tissue sample to a bunch of different electrodes and wires. Then, using
    the controllers, I kind of tried to control the voltage and current that was being
    passed through the tissue, conduct my proper recordings, and then collect all
    that data and analyze it.
  sec: 287
  time: '4:47'
  who: Gloria
- line: You needed to use C for doing this? For controlling the voltage and all that
    stuff.
  sec: 325
  time: '5:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, no. The programs that were used to actually conduct the experiments
    and to do the data collection, I think they were probably based on some kind of
    C language, but this was all software that’s not open source. It's essentially
    software the laboratory already buys and it's configured in the apparatuses and
    everything like that.
  sec: 331
  time: '5:31'
  who: Gloria
- line: The stuff that I had to do in the program was use this on a scientific program
    called Igor. It's not very well known in the open source community. But in the
    scientific community, it's pretty well known. That program has a flavor of C –
    it's not exactly C but it's very, very close to C. For that program, I had a copy
    of it on my laptop, and it was just the program that I knew I could easily import
    the data that I recorded to do the analysis. So I found this tutorial book on
    Amazon, ordered it, read through it and practiced, and then gave it a go with
    building my own little GUI and analyzing the data.
  sec: 331
  time: '5:31'
  who: Gloria
- header: Working with MATLAB, R, C, Python, and SQL
- line: With your background, was it difficult for you to learn to use Igor and its
    language?
  sec: 393
  time: '6:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, I was surprised when I first learned a little bit about programming
    as an undergrad back when I was in the United States. I was working with MATLAB
    and I thought it was the most horrible thing ever. I was so petrified by it. Every
    time I had a course or any kind of class assignment to do with it, I just froze.
    It was impossible. But when I picked up a little bit of programming again back
    in Magdeburg, the other city I worked at, I just gave it a go. And I actually
    enjoyed it quite a bit. Because prior to doing that, or in parallel, I was taking
    this Coursera course to learn R. With R I actually felt that it was a little more
    difficult to pick up. It's not as simple as Python or C or anything like that.
    So when I had to work with C and this program, Igor – it takes quite a bit of
    practice, a lot of trial and error, as anyone who does programming knows  – but
    if you're really, really passionate about it and you are really willing to put
    the hours in to practice and stuff, it becomes quite innate and normal.
  sec: 402
  time: '6:42'
  who: Gloria
- header: Working at ICE
- line: I know that MATLAB can be quite frightening, especially if you don't have
    any programming background. I also needed to use MATLAB at University for doing
    some signal processing. And I thought, “Okay, why are we being tortured with this
    tool? There are other tools that may be better.” So what do you do now at ICE?
  sec: 466
  time: '7:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: At the moment – when I first started, I was hired as a business data analyst
    and I was hired to essentially help my coworkers work on what we call ‘tickets’.
    Essentially, both internal and external customers come to us, because we have
    the SQL capacity and access to the data warehouses in order to compile the reports
    that they need to then do their more high level analysis. I did that for the first
    couple of months when I started at ICE and it was more about learning. I mean
    I knew a little bit of SQL when I started, but it's really easy to pick up, you
    get the hang of it after one or two weeks. But it was more the business model
    that was actually quite complex.
  sec: 490
  time: '8:10'
  who: Gloria
- line: Just things like, “Where can I find all the information? What parameters will
    I have to apply in the SQL statements in order to get the correct information?”
    Especially for business separation, all this data is not separated by customers
    in different tables. They're all just meshed together in the respective tables
    and I had to try to make sure that I wasn't providing information of one customer
    to another external customer. Yeah, I found this quite difficult at first. Also
    taking scripts that my coworkers previously wrote and then just rerunning them.
    And if a customer asked for some kind of alteration, I would spend the day just
    reading and understanding the script and then finding out how I am supposed to
    modify this script to be able to deliver results to the customer.
  sec: 490
  time: '8:10'
  who: Gloria
- line: So that's what I did when I first started. There are also side projects where
    we do collaborations with other departments. Usually when I work on those types
    of projects, it's because I have the program capacity and just the access to the
    data warehouse to then provide the data to the more business-oriented analysts
    – the ones that have a greater business background in terms of this specific data
    model. I work with them to clean up the data, fetch it and they also ask me for
    my interpretation. So I give it a go, try to get some insights, do some exploratory
    work, and then we all work together to try to come up with a story for the data
    – for this specific project.
  sec: 490
  time: '8:10'
  who: Gloria
- line: So, you need to prepare reports, you need to fetch all the data in a form
    that is easy to put in the report. Do you also take care of the reports themselves,
    or somebody else uses the data to visually arrange them?
  sec: 630
  time: '10:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: I usually don't really know what happens to the reports after I submit them
    to the customer. But from what I understand, all these customers don't really
    have any kind of programming capacity. So what they essentially do is a lot of
    analysis and look at the data in Excel. I guess they would create their basic
    graphics and other things they would need in order to present this data to some
    key stakeholder. For instance, if they needed a dashboard, we would be the ones
    that would create the dashboard for them – they would not do that. So if they
    were to look at the data themselves, it's mostly just Excel.
  sec: 645
  time: '10:45'
  who: Gloria
- line: 'So what you do is more or less: there are some data pipelines and you need
    to get data from a database that you say is a little bit complicated. In these
    pipelines, there is data from different customers, which you need to carefully
    get from there, clean it, prepare it, and pass it over to somebody who then will
    analyze this data in Excel. Is that correct?'
  sec: 686
  time: '11:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, yeah.
  sec: 710
  time: '11:50'
  who: Gloria
- line: I'm just curious, what does the company actually do? You said it's something
    related to music, right?
  sec: 713
  time: '11:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, music processing. There are two sides of the business that the company
    works in – in copyright and online data processing. For the copyright side, they're
    essentially the data warehouse for all the music metadata from societies. For
    example, in Germany, there's the GAMMA society, and in the UK, there's PRS. In
    Sweden there’s STIM, and then in the United States, there's BMG.
  sec: 721
  time: '12:01'
  who: Gloria
- line: Essentially, different publishers and societies feed loads of data to us in
    terms of copyright information – the names of the songs, the creators, what rights
    they have to each work, how much percentage of royalty they should be receiving,
    etc. The copyright side of the business takes care of all that. The online side
    of the business essentially takes reports from streaming services, ingest them
    and processes them. Then they fetch the copyright data and calculate how much
    royalty should be paid out to each respective creator, society, or publisher.
  sec: 721
  time: '12:01'
  who: Gloria
- line: Okay. So somebody gets a song, they stream it to the listeners, and then you
    need to figure out how many listeners listened to the song so that you can calculate
    how much they should be paid? Right?
  sec: 785
  time: '13:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Actually, when the streaming services send us reports, they essentially
    just state how many times a given work was streamed so we take that quantity.
    But oftentimes the reports are not fully clean, which means that we sometimes
    need to find ways to identify the work so we can match them to the copyright database.
    After they do the matching, then they can determine what the percentages are in
    terms of mechanical rights, performing rights, different types of types of rights,
    and how much a given artist should be receiving based on the stream count.
  sec: 802
  time: '13:22'
  who: Gloria
- line: And you do this part of the process, right? So you receive some data from
    somebody, but you need to clean this, you need to also match these things that
    are sometimes difficult to match. Right?
  sec: 841
  time: '14:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, there's a couple hundred people that are involved in that full data
    pipeline [chuckles] ingesting the copyright data and making sure that it's correct.
    There are some people that actually have to contact the different societies and
    publishers and ask them to confirm that the metadata is correct. There's also
    people in the online department that make sure that the Oracle data warehouse
    is correctly ingesting the data and then they do some kind of inspection and see
    if the streaming services provided the correct report, or if they provided too
    many missing values. They have to go back and forth with the streaming service
    and tell them “You must send us a new report, one that’s more complete.” Then
    my job is essentially to fetch the data in any given time point in the pipeline
    based on what the customer requests. If they want to know that, “Oh, what was
    the state of the data at this time point A?” Then I should try to fetch it that
    way.
  sec: 856
  time: '14:16'
  who: Gloria
- line: Also, if they receive any kind of discrepancy in the reports, in terms of
    how much people are being paid, we have to try to investigate as to why this occurs.
    When these types of investigations happen, for instance, we provide the present
    state of the data and then we have to communicate to operation departments that
    actually deal with the ingestion in their day-to-day work and ask them to say,
    “Oh, what happened here?” and then they try to explain it to us after investigating
    within their entire department. So essentially, we're kind of the midpoint between
    the internal departments that do the data ingestion and the customers, and provide
    the correct reports for them. We do various types of reports, whether they are
    just excel files that they can look at on their computer, or we build custom dashboards
    for them and then provide refreshes, so then they always have the most up-to-date
    data.
  sec: 856
  time: '14:16'
  who: Gloria
- header: Job hunting after the bootcamp
- line: Yeah, interesting. Can you tell us how you got this job? You graduated from
    a bootcamp and then, I imagine, it wasn't easy to get this job. So how did you
    do this?
  sec: 974
  time: '16:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, yeah. That was quite a journey. So I finished the bootcamp, I think, at
    the beginning of August in 2020. I actually didn't get a job offer until December
    of 2020, so about four and a half months.
  sec: 986
  time: '16:26'
  who: Gloria
- line: You started this already after the pandemic, right? So I guess you applied
    to the bootcamp before the pandemic and then graduated after, right?
  sec: 1001
  time: '16:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, well actually… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1012
  time: '16:52'
  who: Gloria
- line: It wasn’t the best time to look for a job, right?
  sec: 1015
  time: '16:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, if I anticipated that the pandemic was coming about it would
    make the job search much easier. But hey, you know, it's life. It happens. I think
    I found out about bootcamp sometime around April of 2020. Then I finally got the
    funding and started it in May of 2020 and then it finished at the beginning of
    August of 2020. Then I had to do the job plans, send out a ton of applications,
    get constant feedback on CVs and cover letters and stuff like that.
  sec: 1017
  time: '16:57'
  who: Gloria
- line: So it took you 4-5 months, right? Quite some time.
  sec: 1057
  time: '17:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it was quite some time. When I talked to other fellow graduates, or
    other people that were also in the same boat as me, either doing career transitions
    or trying to break into the domain, they also had quite a bit of a hard time applying
    and sending out CVs and doing those take-home tests or those take-home challenges
    and stuff like that.
  sec: 1059
  time: '17:39'
  who: Gloria
- line: Yeah, so how did it go for you? You graduated in August and then you found
    the job in December. So what did you do in these four or five months that actually
    eventually led to the job?
  sec: 1085
  time: '18:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: In parallel to applying for all these jobs, going on LinkedIn, Googling around
    and stuff like that, I also volunteered for Omdena, doing one of their projects.
    I chose to do that as kind of a CV filler, but also to keep me occupied and keep
    me on my toes in terms of coding and understanding machine learning, and all that
    kind of stuff.
  sec: 1101
  time: '18:21'
  who: Gloria
- line: It was also just a good way to provide a distraction from the worries of always
    having to look for work and stuff. That was a really good experience. I learned
    a lot from other people and how they see coding, the solutions they came up with,
    the brainstorming, the collaboration and stuff like that. So yeah, that's how
    I also filled up my time during those three months.
  sec: 1101
  time: '18:21'
  who: Gloria
- line: It's “Omdena.” Right?
  sec: 1155
  time: '19:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Omdena, yes.
  sec: 1157
  time: '19:17'
  who: Gloria
- header: Data engineering vs Data science
- line: I remember you mentioned that last time we talked. I think it was before you
    found a job. I remember you were actually asking how to figure out if you’re more
    interested in engineering. But I think you did this bootcamp in data science,
    but then you realized you're more interested in engineering.
  sec: 1158
  time: '19:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe you can tell us a bit more about that. How did you realize that you're
    more interested in engineering rather than data science? And how did this affect
    your job search?
  sec: 1158
  time: '19:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I remember at the time, I thought it was quite cool to be able to build pipelines
    or to build platforms or to build dashboards. I also found that in the real world,
    it's not like a data science bootcamp where the data is served to you on a silver
    platter and all you have to do is just analyze it. There's actually quite a lot
    of work that goes into it and that typically involves a little bit more data engineering
    and fixing up the data. So when I was searching for jobs, I was actually searching
    for both data engineering and data analytics. I would say that whichever one worked
    out first, that’s the one I would go for.
  sec: 1192
  time: '19:52'
  who: Gloria
- line: It turns out with this position that I eventually got hired for, it is titled
    “business data analysts,” but honestly, I feel like I do both – both data analytics
    and data engineering. With our team, we're in the process of trying to automate
    as many of these customer reports as possible so then we could do more advanced
    data analytics, predictive modeling, and stuff like that. A lot of this is on
    automating and reducing our workload, instead of just being SQL monkeys. This
    actually takes quite a bit of engineering, understanding the data warehouses,
    understanding how to optimize the SQL queries and integrating these SQL queries
    into either R or Python scripts, or even using Docker to push it to AWS and have
    it run at a fixed frequency.
  sec: 1192
  time: '19:52'
  who: Gloria
- header: Using Docker
- line: And you learned all that at ICE already, right? Or did you already know a
    bit of that? I think you mentioned that you learned a bit of Docker at Spiced,
    right?
  sec: 1285
  time: '21:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: I first learned Docker at Spiced. One of the projects that we worked on was
    Docker-based, with a Twitter bot and stuff like that. Once I finished my time
    at Spiced, I didn't really touch on again. Then at the end of last year, we've
    found in the team that we could work better, more collaboratively, and much easier
    if we used Docker containers. For instance, there was one handover project I had
    from a colleague where he wrote all his scripts in R but in his local machine.
  sec: 1295
  time: '21:35'
  who: Gloria
- line: We had different versions of R libraries in the external machines. And then
    when it came to me, I had to test the scripts and see if they run. I couldn't
    execute any of them just because I didn't have the appropriate libraries and installations.
    When I tried to figure out which ones to do, I had to downgrade so many libraries.
    And they said, “No, this is not a proper solution.” So we essentially decided
    to rebuild the scripts in Docker containers and images to verify that they will
    always work. And now that's what we do with the project – anything we want to
    run remotely on AWS, whether it be long scripts or automated reports, we first
    build them in Docker and then just push them to AWS for the developer to then
    start the job or the frequency.
  sec: 1295
  time: '21:35'
  who: Gloria
- header: Keeping track of job applications, employers and questions
- line: Coming back to your job search – do you remember how many applications you
    needed to send in order to eventually get the job?
  sec: 1377
  time: '22:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oof. It was painful. I actually had to count at the end of the year. I think
    it was around 130.
  sec: 1386
  time: '23:06'
  who: Gloria
- line: One hundred and thirty!
  sec: 1392
  time: '23:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah. I remember, I counted them up at the end of the year.
  sec: 1394
  time: '23:14'
  who: Gloria
- line: How did you keep track? Did you put this in an Excel spreadsheet?
  sec: 1397
  time: '23:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, I eventually had to do that. Since you have to send your application
    in PDF format and stuff like that, I kept every job description and every application
    that I submitted in PDF on my computer. Then over the course of two or three days,
    I had to go back to this directory in my computer and count how many job applications
    I sent and it was one around 130ish.
  sec: 1401
  time: '23:21'
  who: Gloria
- line: Why did you need to create a folder for each application?
  sec: 1429
  time: '23:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, no. For each application, I had one PDF, which is the job description
    and the second PDF was the actual application that I sent, so the cover letter,
    CV and whatever form they wanted me to fill out.
  sec: 1434
  time: '23:54'
  who: Gloria
- line: Okay, so you kept this for your own analysis afterwards?
  sec: 1451
  time: '24:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, yes. It was just for my own records and for consistency. In case I need
    to reference back to anything, it's right there. But it's not like they're all
    in little folders on my desktop – they were sub folders within a folder. [chuckles]
  sec: 1458
  time: '24:18'
  who: Gloria
- line: '[laughs] Desktop, yeah. What was it helpful to keep it organized in such
    a way? Usually when I look for a job, I just… Well, last time I wasn''t. I was
    selective, but a few jobs before that, the strategy I used was spray and pray
    – just click as many ‘apply’ buttons as possible without really keeping track
    of where I applied. Then I would sometimes get invited to talk to a recruiter
    and I thought, “Okay, what does this company do?” They would ask me questions
    like “Tell us what you know about us.” And I thought [chuckles] “Hmm. What do
    I know about you? Nothing?” [laughs] So yeah, I was going crazy. Did you keep
    track of these things to actually stay organized and to understand where you applied
    and keep track of what the company is doing?'
  sec: 1475
  time: '24:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I actually did. For applications, if I was really interested in a job
    post and I was fully intent on actually applying for it, I would save the job
    description as a PDF, because they take jobs down just as quickly as they post
    them. So it was just a personal record. It was also to see, if I was later in
    the interview process and they mentioned something about requirements like, “Oh,
    we offer these benefits and this is our salary range,” and stuff like that, I
    would go back to the job description to see, “Is this still the case or did they
    change it quite a bit?”
  sec: 1524
  time: '25:24'
  who: Gloria
- line: Aha! That’s smart.
  sec: 1562
  time: '26:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, because you never know. That can happen as well. I also kept my application
    to see, “Okay, what did I actually say? What did I actually write in my original
    application?” in case they mention it again in the interview. It'd be good to
    be consistent, at least in their eyes.

    were, what you answered to these questions? Or was it more lightweight?
  sec: 1581
  time: '26:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not at first, but then I started realizing that I should. So I did that quite
    a bit. I didn't create a spreadsheet for every single interview, but I did create
    just one massive doc of questions that I felt stood out, or those that I felt
    were either very challenging or very good. Then I would write them down. I didn't
    exactly write down how I actually responded, but rather what my ideal response
    would be – the aftermath. When you’re not nervous or anything like that.
  sec: 1593
  time: '26:33'
  who: Gloria
- line: Yeah. So you know the question and then you come back to this question when
    you're not stressed, you just sit down and write your ideal answer. That probably
    helps you get this question right.
  sec: 1621
  time: '27:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. I guess there's only so many finite questions companies can
    ask you. It's also a good way to practice. For instance, if I had an interview
    that I knew was coming up, I would take my long list of collected questions and
    just go through them one by one. Yeah, that helped a lot.
  sec: 1636

    for you? [cross-talk] …maybe or something else?
  sec: 1675
  time: '27:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm sorry?
  sec: 1685
  time: '28:05'
  who: Gloria
- line: Was it live coding perhaps, or maybe something else? I know many people find
    it very difficult to do live coding. So I'm wondering, was this the case for you?
  sec: 1687
  time: '28:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, yeah. I mean, I only had one live coding session and that one I thought
    was quite difficult. It's just that I'm a nervous interviewer and I don't do very
    well under pressure, especially if someone is looking at my screen. The thing
    that sucked about this one is that when they scheduled the interview with me,
    they didn't actually explain to me what would occur during it. I thought it would
    be like a multi-interview process where you would first meet the team and then
    possibly meet HR afterwards and stuff like that. But they smushed it all into
    one and that surprised me. I think in the last half an hour of the interview,
    they said “Oh, by the way. We're going to be doing a live coding challenge.” I
    was like, “Oh, that's so cheap. That's so mean.”
  sec: 1696
  time: '28:16'
  who: Gloria
- line: It did not go very well, because I was quite bad at Python writing class back
    then and I had to do that live. At the time, it was very difficult. I was not
    able to do the live code and the data engineer also wanted to see how I did Googling
    and stuff like that. I was quite nervous about that. I think about 10 minutes
    after the interview, I was able to write the whole class and I sent it to them
    like, “Oh, here. Just in case. If you want to consider me.” But it's so surprising
    how long it takes for you to do some kind of live coding when you're under pressure
    versus when you're just on your own figuring stuff out.
  sec: 1696
  time: '28:16'
  who: Gloria
- line: You said you couldn't do this live, but then after the interview ended, you
    just did this because you didn't have any pressure and then you sent it to them.
    And then what happened after that?
  sec: 1788
  time: '29:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: In the end, they sent me an email like one or two weeks later saying “Oh,
    we felt so honored that there were so many applicants that applied. There's so
    many nice applicants.” You know – all the fluffy stuff.
  sec: 1801

  who: Gloria
- line: Basically a rejection letter, right?
  sec: 1816
  time: '30:16'
  who: Alexey

- line: Yeah. The letter said “Unfortunately, we're not going to continue with your
    application. But if you allow us, (because of the GDPR and data protection laws
    and stuff like that), we would like to keep your personal data on file.” In the
    end, I decided that I'd like to exercise my rights to data privacy. Should I want
    to apply for any position there, the ad will just pop up again, and I will just
    reapply.
  sec: 1819
  time: '30:19'
  who: Gloria

  sec: 1848
  time: '30:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, yes.
  sec: 1851
  time: '30:51'
  who: Gloria
- line: Okay. And this way you can apply again, and they don’t know. Well, theoretically.
    If they follow the process.
  sec: 1852
  time: '30:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that is true. Yeah. Technically, if they follow the process they wouldn't
    know. But I mean, there's also all these companies that say, “Oh, we would like
    to keep your data just in case of anything.” Do companies actually go through
    their applicant pool to look for people? For me, I thought there's no point in
    approving this, especially in this day and age with all the data privacy problems.
    If I can avoid it, I would rather keep my data to myself.

    was. Maybe you were going to say something else – not live coding?
  sec: 1889
  time: '31:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: I actually have to give it a good think. I would say there were many difficult
    things in different stages of the whole process. At the beginning, it was creating
    a good CV and a cover letter. That was hard at the beginning, but once I got into
    good practice with that, it was okay. The one thing that was difficult, and something
    that I still have trouble with, would be the salary negotiation. I think that
    this is the most difficult because I find that that's a key determinant as to
    whether they even consider you as an applicant and how far along you go in the
    application process. I feel it's quite a necessary skill set to have – to know
    your worth and to really insist on it.
  sec: 1896
  time: '31:36'
  who: Gloria
- line: But how do you gain that skill? Especially if you're fresh out of a bootcamp
    and you do not have such insights into the market? How do you know that?
  sec: 1946
  time: '32:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: I guess when you first start doing the job search and many companies ask you
    for your asking salary, you just have to do a lot of Googling and research. For
    instance, I think LinkedIn offers some stats, especially in the city that you
    reside in, regarding how much you should ideally be making. They're not very clear
    stats because they don't consider your experience level very much, so it's quite
    ambiguous. I also suggest talking to different people. The people from the bootcamp
    I did offered me quite a bit of career coaching advice and that helped a lot with
    understanding what kind of asking salary I should have.
  sec: 1959
  time: '32:39'
  who: Gloria
- line: I'm just wondering, if you're looking for your first job, would it be a good
    strategy to say, “I'm ready to take whatever salary you offer me. Just hire me,”
    or no?

  who: Gloria
- line: Okay. [chuckles] Why not?
  sec: 2018
  time: '33:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely not. Because, of course, they're going to give you the lowest salary
    they can. Companies are going to try to save as much as possible – they want to
    hire the most experienced person for the least amount of money. I've also heard
    that your asking salary is actually a reflection of how confident you feel of
    your skills.
  sec: 2019
  time: '33:39'
  who: Gloria
- line: Or of how well you know the market, right? Maybe you don’t know how much is
    normal.
  sec: 2056
  time: '34:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that is true. I think that's a skill set in itself – knowing the market
    well enough to ask for the right salary.
  sec: 2059
  time: '34:19'
  who: Gloria
- header: The importance of career coaching and support
- line: Yeah, I imagine that could be tough even for people with experience already.
    Although with people that have experience and those who already have a job, they
    can just say “Okay, what I'm making now – let's add 10% to that. That would probably
    be a good baseline.” But if you don't have a job then “Okay, how much should I
    ask that’s too much not too low?” For you, you said it was helpful to have a career
    coach at Spiced who helped you with these numbers, right?
  sec: 2067
  time: '34:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, having a career coach and also just having friends or colleagues from
    the bootcamp. People that are more veterans to the industry, know how to negotiate
    salaries, and know how to do a self evaluation for salary negotiation and stuff
    like that. I also consulted with them a lot and that helped a lot. So networking
    is actually quite helpful as well.
  sec: 2095
  time: '34:55'
  who: Gloria

    that your friends shared with you that you found helpful?
  sec: 2119
  time: '35:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm trying to think back. I guess for the position that I got, in the end,
    I did ask us slightly below the market a little bit – 5K below – by accident.
    I typically asked around the average market, but by accident for that application,
    I put in a little less. And I guess that's one of the reasons why they took me
    as well. I don't know, in terms of tips, I would say my friends, and the career
    coach as well, they told me to always ask for a little more and then you negotiate
    your way down. I also have a friend that told me that she waited to hear what
    their salary offer was, and then she always added one or two thousand more. She
    said, “They're not going to turn down my application over just one or two thousand
    euros.”
  sec: 2129

  who: Gloria
- header: Skills learned at Spiced

    up not doing data science. Was what you learned at Spiced actually useful for
    you?
  sec: 2180
  time: '36:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it really was. For instance, programming alone – I had never worked
    with Python prior to going into Spiced. Of course, now I work a lot with Python
    and SQL. A lot of the data engineering tools that I learned at Spiced, I also
    use on my job as well, or will use. Docker for instance, I use that a lot now.
    I also learned a little bit about Airflow while I was in Spiced and my team is
    interested in trying to incorporate Airflow into everyday activities. So, even
    though I don't do data science at the moment, there are plans for a couple of
    members in our team to start doing more predictive modeling – so more on the machine
    learning side. A lot of the things I learned at Spiced were definitely very helpful
    for my job.

  sec: 2245
  time: '37:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would definitely say getting career coaching a little earlier in the game.
    I remember I did apply to a couple of jobs and had one or two interviews prior
    to attending the boot camp at Spiced and prior to getting through career coaching.
    Retrospectively looking back, I see that I made a ton of mistakes when I was doing
    that interview. Definitely about salary expectations – I would definitely do that
    much better. Let's see, what else?
  sec: 2266
  time: '37:46'
  who: Gloria
- line: In the end, we can't control everything and the markets are constantly changing,
    but I would definitely like to do even more networking. Though during the pandemic,
    it's quite difficult to do a lot of networking since everything was remote. You
    could only meet people via video or chat or something. Maybe I would also do the
    career transition even earlier, like back in 2015 or something like that, when
    you yourself did it. It must have been very different back then.
  sec: 2266
  time: '37:46'
  who: Gloria
- line: Yeah, it was different. I had just one interview and after that they hired
    me. [laughs] Sorry. It's like the complete opposite of the experience you had.
  sec: 2334
  time: '38:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah, it was.'
  sec: 2342
  time: '39:02'
  who: Gloria
- line: I literally had just one interview and that was it. It wasn't even a series
    of interviews. Right now companies torture applicants through like four or five
    interviews. But for me, it just was just one. First, the future Team Lead reached
    out to me on LinkedIn, we had a short call and then I went to the office on the
    next day. Then a couple of days after that, they gave me an offer.
  sec: 2344
  time: '39:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, nice.
  sec: 2370
  time: '39:30'
  who: Gloria

    [chuckles] I don’t think it works that way anymore.
  sec: 2371
  time: '39:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Oh, yeah. I think it''s quite different now.'
  sec: 2379
  time: '39:39'
  who: Gloria
- line: Yeah. So that's why as I said at the beginning, when people invite me to talk
    about career transitioning, I usually say “Yeah… things were different back then.”
    That's why I really like inviting people who did their transition recently, so
    they have a more fresh perspective on things. Because now it's more difficult.
    Now there are all these boot camps, the demand is maybe higher, but also, there
    are more people on the market. So it's very difficult now.
  sec: 2382
  time: '39:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Have you interviewed people that had the transition more recently, like
    within the past year or six months?
  sec: 2416
  time: '40:16'
  who: Gloria
- line: Well, maybe not. [chuckles]
  sec: 2425
  time: '40:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, I wonder what it is now. Is it even worse?
  sec: 2427
  time: '40:27'
  who: Gloria
- line: But still, for you, it took like five months. I think this is a pretty long
    time. And it was difficult. I hope it's easier now than it used to be.
  sec: 2434
  time: '40:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: I hope so too.
  sec: 2445
  time: '40:45'
  who: Gloria
- line: Okay. You said you made a ton of mistakes and that you needed to talk to career
    coaches who pointed out these mistakes. One of these mistakes was salary negotiations.
    Do you remember what kind of other mistakes you’ve made?
  sec: 2447
  time: '40:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Other mistakes. I'm trying to think. Maybe it's something I said incorrectly
    in an interview – like they were expecting one answer and I gave them another.
    I think also a couple of the tech challenges that I did for another data engineering
    position. I think they didn't like some of the techniques that I used in my code
    and they felt like it was essentially the same thing over and over again. I felt
    like the instructions of the take-home challenge that they gave me were quite
    ambiguous. In the email exchange, they made a lot of references like, “Well, we
    haven't stated this. We haven't stated that.” And I felt like the hiring manager
    wasn’t very clear in communicating what they wanted.
  sec: 2463
  time: '41:03'
  who: Gloria
- line: So I guess, retrospectively, I would have spoken out and said, “No, this is
    not what you said. This is not how I interpreted it.” Of course, at the time,
    you're a little nervous and you're a little too humble, so you tend to stay quiet.
    But looking back now, I feel like I have a little more power because I have a
    job and stuff. I can be like, “No, that's not what you said.” So I can stand up
    for myself.
  sec: 2463
  time: '41:03'
  who: Gloria
- header: Top skills that helped Gloria get the job
- line: Yeah. Interesting. Thanks for sharing that. I see that we have some questions.
    So one of the questions is from Vadim, who asks “What are the top skills or tech
    stack that you believe helped you to get this role?”
  sec: 2542
  time: '42:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely knowing a bit of programming skills – both Python and R. I did
    put that I knew SQL, even though I had only done it for like two weeks in the
    bootcamp. They liked it a lot that I went to bootcamp. I had experience with using
    machine learning and stuff like that. So they definitely hired me for that. I
    felt like one thing that they really liked about me in the interview was how I
    recognize the importance of clean data and doing data quality checks. Because
    if you don't check your data and whether it’s clean or not, it really skews the
    results in your reports. I see it from day-to-day work that it's really necessary
    for us to do that. So I think that was the one of the things that stood out.
  sec: 2558
  time: '42:38'
  who: Gloria
- line: Can you tell us a bit more about these checks for data quality? Was it a take-home
    test that you did and then you went the extra mile and added some checks or how
    did it happen?
  sec: 2602
  time: '43:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: For this particular position it was just SQL challenges where they hired another
    company to provide me with an SQL test – like a live SQL session. I think I had
    like an hour to answer three or four SQL challenges. But actually, this data cleaning
    thing came more in the interview process. I think in terms of skills, everyone
    goes to boot camps now or does these online courses and they essentially have
    kind of the same skill sets. I guess what they look for in interviews or what
    stands out, is if the person recognizes what's essential on the job. Because a
    lot of companies think – and it is kind of true – that you can learn things on
    the job.
  sec: 2617
  time: '43:37'
  who: Gloria
- line: Whatever technical skills you're missing, you can learn it on the job. For
    instance, if you know how to provide insights, if you know how to detect anomalies,
    if you know how to work, what to do, when the data is just not clean and not organized
    and you need to do quite a bit of fixing it up, and what steps you take and stuff
    like that. I would say maybe they consider this a little more important.
  sec: 2617
  time: '43:37'
  who: Gloria
- line: And you did learn quite a few things on the job, rights? Things that you didn't
    know about, or maybe you just worked with them a little bit, like SQL – you said
    that you spent only two weeks learning SQL, but now it's pretty much all that
    you do all day, right? Maybe not that much, but like 50% at least. So you definitely
    can learn all that.
  sec: 2683
  time: '44:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. I didn't know this before I started working on my job, but
    there are different flavors of SQL. Each data warehouse has their own format of
    SQL. For instance, one SQL query that I'll execute in one data warehouse, for
    example Redshift, sometimes won't work in an Oracle-based data warehouse, so I'll
    have to customize the queries in that way. So yes, I just learned to recognize
    that.

    any cloud platform in the bootcamp?”
  sec: 2729
  time: '45:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. At Spiced we did AWS, just because it's free for the first year. It's
    actually quite cheap to continue learning even after the first year is done. I
    did a little bit of Google Cloud Platform, but not as much. But I think in terms
    of cloud platforms, AWS is the most requested.

  sec: 2766
  time: '46:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it was. I was actually exploring how to do some kind of dashboards in
    R at the time. I think there was this one Medium article that I found, which explained
    that it was possible on Google Cloud Platform. So for one weekend, I just sat
    down and gave it a go over there.
  sec: 2771
  time: '46:11'
  who: Gloria
- line: The good thing about Google Cloud Platform is when you sign up, you get $300
    and you can do pretty much everything with this $300, while in AWS, there are
    only some services that you can use under the Free Tier. So with Google Cloud
    Platform, you have more freedom, but it's also only for three months.
  sec: 2791
  time: '46:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. But I also actually remember from Google Cloud Platform, when I was
    trying out some stuff – those credits actually go by quite fast. If you don't
    know what you're doing, if you let things run all night, or you don't pay attention
    to what you're executing – those credits can go by pretty fast.
  sec: 2813

  sec: 2853
  time: '47:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: In my personal opinion, from what I remember when I was looking for jobs in
    the market, a lot of companies equated online courses and data science boot camp
    as the same. They actually didn't really see a difference. I personally think
    I preferred the data science bootcamp and I would do it again, just because I
    had a couple different teachers to talk to, I could customize projects, and just
    enjoyed interacting and working with other students. I think this is invaluable
    and I would definitely do it again.
  sec: 2874

    is at least one, maybe two in Berlin. There’s not as many as data science boot
    camps, but there are data engineering bootcamps as well. What do you maybe now
    consider doing this kind of bootcamp, or would you still go with the data science
    one?
  sec: 2910

    bit of data analytics, data engineering, and data science.
  sec: 2928

- line: Yeah, I think it depends on the person. At the time, I think it was good for
    me because I wasn't sure what part of the data science field I wanted to get into
    – whether it be analytics, predictive modeling, or engineering. So it was good
    to go to a bootcamp that had a little bit of everything. But I guess if you're
    a person that is dead-set on something, like, “I definitely want to do data engineering,”
    then I guess those bootcamps would be great for you. So I guess they kind of serve
    your niche a little more.

    after academia, right? In academia you understood that you wanted to do coding,
    but what exactly does it mean to “do coding”? Right?
  sec: 2987
  time: '49:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. Even though I knew I didn't want to work in academia anymore,
    and that I wanted to do more analytics and “eccentric things,” but I also wasn't
    100% sure exactly what it was that I wanted to do.

- line: Can you maybe tell us a bit about the projects that you did at Spiced? At
    the end, I know that you had some individual projects where you needed to work
    by yourself on some things. I think you did something related to Twitter analytics,
    right?
  sec: 3015
  time: '50:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It was essentially learning how to build a data pipeline using Docker
    to fetch data from a Twitter API based on whatever hashtags or parameters you're
    interested in. Then coding – one of those bots on Slack would provide you with
    the Tweet information once every hour, or once every minute, or something like
    that.
  sec: 3030
  time: '50:30'
  who: Gloria
- line: Was it actually a project that you needed to do yourself – your individual
    project – or something that everyone needed to do?
  sec: 3058
  time: '50:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was one that everyone did. They outlined the project in a custom build
    and then they provided us with lessons every day on how to do a different part
    of the project until we delivered it on Friday.
  sec: 3064
  time: '51:04'
  who: Gloria
- line: So it took one week to build this pipeline? Was it a lesson about building
    pipelines?
  sec: 3077
  time: '51:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It was essentially learning to build Docker containers. One to just
    collect the tweets, a second one to clean them up, and then a third one to push
    the Tweet information to Slack every hour.
  sec: 3084
  time: '51:24'

- header: Standing out in a sea of applicants
- line: I'm wondering. Let's say somebody graduates from bootcamp – at DataTalks.Club
    we also call them zoomcamps, but they're similar, like workshops. People finish
    these courses with a bunch of projects that they did during the course, and also
    individually as a part of the course. How do you actually “sell” this to future
    employers? How do you say, “Okay, this is the thing I did and I’m valuable because
    I know how to do these things.” So how do you actually show that you can do these
    things using these projects? Do they even believe you? Because if you do this
    as a part of the course, maybe you just followed the instructor and that's all,
    right?
  sec: 3102
  time: '51:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Yes, it is quite tricky. I mean, they always tell you, “Oh, you have
    to build a portfolio full of projects to show at your job application,” but then
    also when the employers see that these projects are basically from a bootcamp
    or from an online course, they probably see the same projects over and over again.
    I guess they do get quite tired of it. I would say maybe individualized personal
    projects would be better. Or if you custom-made a project yourself and show why
    you started the project, why you chose that topic, why you are interested in doing
    this particular project – I think this stands out a little more.
  sec: 3151
  time: '52:31'
  who: Gloria
- line: For one of the data engineering jobs I applied for – I didn't get it in the
    end – but one of the reasons why they chose my application to continue in the
    application process was because they found that the individual project at the
    end of the bootcamp that I did was something pertaining to sustainability. They
    thought that was interesting and they saw that I was interested in sustainability,
    so that's why they chose me for the application process.
  sec: 3151
  time: '52:31'
  who: Gloria
- line: What was the project about? Can you tell us about it?
  sec: 3214
  time: '53:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was essentially where I was trying to build a data pipeline where I would
    fetch Tweets that were associated with sustainability hashtags. Then I would clean
    up the data and I was in the process of trying to build a dashboard to show different
    stats and different features and different insights about the Tweets that were
    being Tweeted at the time.
  sec: 3217
  time: '53:37'
  who: Gloria
- line: One of the things I never got to pick up again (or I just haven't taken the
    time to finish it up) but I found that there's actually quite a bit of Tweet bots
    on data and that really skews results. For instance, I did a little bit of sentiment
    analysis on the Tweets and the Tweet bots skew the sentiment analysis very much.
    Yeah, that's another lesson learned – you need to implement ways to clean this
    activity out so you don't get them in your final results.
  sec: 3217
  time: '53:37'
  who: Gloria
- line: Probably there are not so many of them – maybe a handful that are most active.
    You can maybe just remove all them from the analysis. At least this is my experience
    with Twitter bots. There are just a few that are most annoying – the most visible
    ones.
  sec: 3273
  time: '54:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but I think the problem is just knowing to identify them, especially
    if you just have tons and tons of data in your model.
  sec: 3290
  time: '54:50'
  who: Gloria
- line: Right. You don't know which of them are causing problems.
  sec: 3298
  time: '54:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, yeah. It's very difficult to tell. I know there are algorithms out
    there that can already be implemented in your pipeline which will auto-detect
    them – they'll help you flag which ones are actually Tweet bots. I know one at
    an academic research lab in the States, they consistently develop this algorithm
    to be able to determine the Tweet bots and they do Twitter analysis themselves
    for social sciences.
  sec: 3301
  time: '55:01'
  who: Gloria
- line: Why was this employer interested in that? Is this something they also do as
    a company?
  sec: 3326
  time: '55:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it was just because the title of my project was “Current Opinion on Sustainability”.
    I'm not sure if they actually dug into my project. In the interview process, they
    didn't ask me too many detailed questions about it. They just asked me things
    like, “Give a brief summary on this project.” And that was it. I think they were
    more interested in the fact that I was also interested in their mission because
    they were a sustainability company. In other words I was someone that took a personal
    interest in that topic.
  sec: 3332
  time: '55:32'
  who: Gloria
- line: Yeah, I heard a similar story, albeit a little bit different, which was also
    about personal interests. So one person got a job interview because they mentioned
    meditation as their interest. The person who was doing the screening was also
    into meditation so that's why they invited them and they talked a bit about that
    at the beginning. So you never know what will work out at the end. So sustainability
    could be your interest and meditation – it could be anything. But I guess this
    is not easy to predict. When you have a pile of applications, who do you select
    to interview, right?
  sec: 3366
  time: '56:06'
  who: Alexey

- header: The cohorts at Spiced
- line: We have another question from Chris. So Chris is asking “What was your cohort
    like at Spiced?” Were they all at similar career stages as you? People with PhD,
    Master’s, etc.? Or did they have different backgrounds?”
  sec: 3408
  time: '56:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, we all had different backgrounds, but it was also quite nice. They were
    also in the transition phases of their lives. So even though we came from different
    backgrounds, we related to each other so much. We actually exchanged a lot of
    our personal career stories. There were a couple of former project managers, there
    were two people that were on the verge of finishing their PhDs, and there were
    others that used to work in consulting for many different domains. I've heard
    that there are some cohorts where they have either more or less diversity in terms
    of different backgrounds. I think either the cohort before or two cohorts before
    me were mostly academics trying to get into machine learning and stuff like that.
    But yeah, every cohort is different.
  sec: 3426
  time: '57:06'
  who: Gloria
- line: Which background was the most interesting to you? Do you remember?
  sec: 3477
  time: '57:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think the one that had quite a big transitional difference. It was one of
    my colleagues that has a background in literature and was doing his PhD in the
    classics but he wanted to get into data engineering and coding. I thought I felt
    like that was a huge jump. Yeah. But he was super good. Anytime there was a bug
    I couldn't solve, I always went to him and said, “Oh, can you please help me out?
    I got this bug.” And he was like, “Oh, yeah. Let me take care of it for you.”
  sec: 3483
  time: '58:03'
  who: Gloria
- line: Yeah, interesting. A couple of episodes ago, I invited Jessica, who was working
    as a barista and went into coding. That's also quite an interesting change – from
    barista to coding. Okay, I think we should be wrapping up. Do you want to say
    anything before we finish today?
  sec: 3517
  time: '58:37'
  who: Alexey
- header: Conclusion
- line: No, I think your questions essentially covered all of them. It was really
    cool doing this. This is the first time in a long time that I've been asked about
    this whole transition phase in my life. It was nice reminiscing about all these
    things.
  sec: 3542
  time: '59:02'
  who: Gloria
- line: I think one year – or maybe one year is a bit too long – like six months to
    one year after somebody already quit a job is a good time to ask how they did
    the transition. Not that I waited on purpose for one year before contacting you.
    But then I realized, “Okay, maybe I should talk to Gloria and ask her about that.”
    Yeah. Thanks a lot for joining us today, for sharing your experience, for talking
    about all the difficulties you had in your job search process. Thanks, also to
    everyone for attending today and for asking questions. I think that would be it
    for today. Thanks again.
