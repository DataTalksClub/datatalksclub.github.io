  time: 0:06
  who: Alexey
- line: There is a pinned link in the live chat for submitting questions. Click the
    link and we will cover your questions during the interview. Now I am stopping
    the screen share. I am opening the document with questions. We can start.
  sec: 41
  time: 0:41
  who: Alexey
- line: Sounds great to me. You took a sip of your tea so it seems you are ready.
  sec: 61
  time: '1:01'
  who: Sofya
- line: I already showed this to Sofya but I want to show it again. This is a souvenir
    I got at Web Summit, a conference I attended recently. Was it two or three weeks
    ago. It feels recent. The event was huge and very impressive.
  sec: 68
  time: '1:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was almost a month ago. Time flies.
  sec: 79
  time: '1:19'
  who: Sofya
- line: This conference in Lisbon is enormous. It was my first time attending. I had
    heard it was big but I could not imagine the actual scale. The main stage is like
    an arena where large concerts could be held. There are also five or six pavilions
    with exhibitions.
  sec: 89
  time: '1:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: I attended only on Tuesday and managed to go through one and a half pavilions
    during the entire day. That was all I could cover. In one of these pavilions I
    met Sofya. Hi Sofya. That moment was memorable.
  sec: 121
  time: '2:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was walking through the stands and noticed something related to fitness
    and measurement. Since I use a Garmin watch and enjoy running, I like tracking
    health metrics. I saw Sofya at the stand talking about tracking. I said that I
    also care about tracking my fitness data. We talked for a while and at the end
    she said, You know this is for dogs.
  sec: 138
  time: '2:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I also got this pin from her. For those listening without video, the pin shows
    a happy dog on a leash. The dog is smiling and wearing boots. I wondered why it
    has boots. I also asked if it is a he or a she.
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is a he. His name is Milo.
  sec: 196
  time: '3:16'
  who: Sofya
- line: So Milo is smiling, wearing boots, and the bottom says Fit Tails which is
    the startup Sofya is running. The design is fun and memorable.
  sec: 202
  time: '3:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: That is correct.
  sec: 214
  time: '3:34'
  who: Sofya
- line: This is a longer intro than usual but the day at Web Summit was intense and
    full of impressions. All those memories came back while I was talking. Today I
    am speaking with Sofya whom I met there. We will discuss sensors, technologies
    for measuring dog behavior, and how to analyze that data. Sofya is the founder
    and CEO of a PetTech startup.
  sec: 220
  time: '3:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: We have FinTech and EdTech and now also PetTech. You can describe her startup
    as an Apple Watch for dogs. Her work sits at the intersection of machine learning,
    sensor data, and real world behavior patterns. We will discuss the challenges
    of animal health technology compared to human wearables. I know something about
    human wearables from using my Garmin watch.
  sec: 257
  time: '4:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: I have no idea how things work for dogs so I am curious to learn more. This
    curiosity is one of the reasons Sofya is here today. I was impressed by what I
    heard from her at Web Summit. Sofya, welcome to our event. Now you can finally
    speak.
  sec: 292
  time: '4:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you, Alexey, for inviting me. I still have many emotions from Web Summit.
    It was my first time attending. It is the biggest gathering of startup and tech
    people in one place. It is huge and full of energy.
  sec: 316
  time: '5:16'
  who: Sofya
- line: You meet so many people and have many conversations that the emotions stay
    with you. It was wonderful to have the chance to attend. I already bought a ticket
    for 2026. There was a discount so I decided to get it early. I am excited to visit
    again.
  sec: 335
  time: '5:35'
  who: Sofya
- line: Okay Sofya, tell us about your career journey so far. What did you do before,
    and how did this all lead to creating a startup.
  sec: 373
  time: '6:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is a difficult question because my background is a mix of tech, product,
    and doing many things at once. Migrants often need to juggle many responsibilities.
    I will not go too deep into personal details about moving. I recently moved again
    and that added to the journey. I moved to London in September so I am still new
    here.
  sec: 383
  time: '6:23'
  who: Sofya
- line: And you are originally from Latvia, right.
  sec: 421
  time: '7:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I lived in Russia, then moved to Latvia, and now to the UK. It has been a
    long journey. I have been into tech from a young age. My first serious project
    was a create your own bouquet tool where you drag and drop flowers. I was maybe
    13 or 14 when I built it.
  sec: 421
  time: '7:01'
  who: Sofya
- line: I was amazed by it and felt very proud. I thought my whole career would be
    in programming. I found the project years later and it was terrible but that is
    how everyone starts. I had good teachers who encouraged me. I loved going to Olympiads
    in English, literature, and math. I often skipped regular lessons to attend competitions.
  sec: 461
  time: '7:41'
  who: Sofya
- line: That is how everything began. I joined the math and informatics program at
    school. I won the school Olympiad and went to the regional one. Then I went to
    a boot camp to prepare for more competitions. At 13 or 14 I was mostly doing web
    programming and making small sites and games. After school I enjoyed working on
    these projects instead of homework.
  sec: 512
  time: '8:32'
  who: Sofya
- line: I loved programming because you could build something alone from scratch and
    focus on details. After school I went to a full time job and chose the coding
    path. Later I did go to university. I worked as a programmer for a while. Over
    time I lost the creative spark because the work was focused on delivery and speed.
  sec: 561
  time: '9:21'
  who: Sofya
- header: Journey from programming hobby to full time software development career
- line: I realized coding in a company was not for me. My hobby had become restrictive.
    I wanted creativity and depth. That is when I moved toward product work. I wanted
    to analyze the market, shape strategies, talk to people, understand problems,
    and build products. That felt more aligned with what I wanted to do.
  sec: 600
  time: '10:00'
  who: Sofya
- line: I had a similar experience in my first job. At university everything felt
    exciting, but at work I had to fix bugs in an old enterprise Java project written
    by someone who left. It was draining and boring. When a hobby becomes a job, it
    changes everything.
  sec: 673
  time: '11:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. In my first job there was no documentation or processes. There was
    also the story about the genius developer who left a week before I joined. I had
    to figure everything out on my own. This was around five or six years ago. It
    was not a great experience and I knew I wanted to switch to product work.
  sec: 689
  time: '11:29'
  who: Sofya
- line: I moved into product and project management. At a small consulting company
    I made the classic mistake of helping with coding. I thought I could quickly fix
    a few things and ended up doing everything. The team relied on me and management
    pushed me to do more. I learned the importance of boundaries.
  sec: 747
  time: '12:27'
  who: Sofya
- line: I left that company and joined an automotive parts company. That job was like
    a founder boot camp. We built an ERP system for automotive businesses from scratch.
    Their previous system was a mix of spreadsheets spread across Google Drive and
    OneDrive. It was chaotic and confusing.
  sec: 877
  time: '14:37'
  who: Sofya
- line: I talked to many clients and mapped all their processes. I was not into cars
    at all and did not even drive, yet I had to understand everything. I interviewed
    logistics, sales, marketing, and every department involved. I built a team and
    enjoyed working with them. When I joined there were five of us in development.
  sec: 935
  time: '15:35'
  who: Sofya
- line: It felt friendly and collaborative. I later scaled the team to 18 people.
    Eventually the environment became less cozy and we needed to focus on strategy
    and bigger challenges. I still miss the team because they were great people. We
    solved hard problems in short timeframes while dealing with a ten year old legacy
    system. Some days I worked sixteen hours and it was intense.
  sec: 1000
  time: '16:40'
  who: Sofya
- header: Career growth after skipping university and building practical experience
- line: All of that you did without any formal university education, right? You finished
    school and went straight into work which is amazing. I have not met many people
    with a path like yours. Usually people study something unrelated and then switch
    to tech and their journey is similar except they spend five years at university
    first. During those five years you could have progressed your career already.
  sec: 1040
  time: '17:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Often people who start after school and people who start after university
    end up at the same level. In Germany I met people who went to a full stack boot
    camp right after school. It lasted four months and they soon found a job. They
    skipped five years of university and replaced it with four months of learning
    which is an interesting career choice. Later I checked your LinkedIn and saw that
    you did attend university.
  sec: 1046
  time: '17:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: I remembered myself at seventeen when I was finishing school. I did not know
    what I wanted to do in life. I liked programming but also liked chemistry, yet
    there was no chemistry program in my city so I went with programming. Many people
    at that age feel lost and choose something because parents say it is good. They
    try different things, get work experience, and then understand what they actually
    want to study. Was that your journey.
  sec: 1084
  time: '18:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say not exactly because if I had wanted to study product management
    I would not have chosen computer science. I am not even sure if one can study
    product management directly at university, maybe business administration is close
    enough. For me it was simple because I had a hobby I loved and I wanted to learn
    it deeper. That is why I joined university. I combined work and university at
    the same time and it was quite a journey.
  sec: 1129
  time: '18:49'
  who: Sofya
- header: Puppy adoption story and family influence on pet focused innovation
- line: Some university courses were frustrating because with real experience you
    realize things do not work exactly as described. Other courses really helped,
    even for product management, because they gave insight into how everything functions.
    For me going to university was mostly about academic studies in machine learning.
    I initially thought the entry barrier was too high to try it randomly the same
    way I learned web development. At that time resources were not as widespread and
    university felt like the simple path to access structured knowledge.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Sofya
- line: The reason I wanted to talk about your career is because your path is interesting
    and uncommon. It is a cool story. Now I also want to learn more about your startup.
    How did you come up with the idea. Tell us.
  sec: 1250
  time: '20:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was a radical decision because I always wanted a dog. I never adopted one
    because as a kid parents put pressure by saying there was no time and as an adult
    I understood the real constraints. I moved a lot, worked full time, studied, and
    everything had to be done in person. There was no room for a dog even though I
    wanted one.
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Sofya
- line: At some point my job became more remote so I only had to go to the office
    two or three times a week. I adored working from home and thought it might be
    time to consider adopting a dog. There is also a funny story. My husband and I
    were scrolling a website where you can find various things. In Latvia it is ss
    dot com which is similar to many listing platforms.
  sec: 1312
  time: '21:52'
  who: Sofya
- line: He was joking about adopting a spider even though I cannot even look at one
    from five meters away. Then we clicked on the puppies section and saw that a Labrador
    puppy was available. It was the first of January and we wrote to the breeder asking
    if any puppies were still available. She said four were left from a litter of
    ten. We asked if we could come and see them.
  sec: 1380
  time: '23:00'
  who: Sofya
- line: She suggested meeting the next day but my husband insisted on going the same
    evening. He said if we waited until tomorrow we might not adopt anyone. We ended
    up driving an hour and a half outside the city in freezing weather. We met all
    the puppies. One chewed my boot, one ran around, one barked, and one sat in front
    of me and looked into my eyes.
  sec: 1429
  time: '23:49'
  who: Sofya
- line: We spent an hour outside at minus fifteen degrees and we were freezing. We
    chose the puppy who kept looking at me. I felt she chose me and still think so.
    We took her home and everything changed the same way parenting changes your routine.
    A puppy needs constant attention and it completely shifts your day.
  sec: 1481
  time: '24:41'
  who: Sofya
- line: It is two months of sleepless nights because the puppy is stressed and cries.
    She needs to go outside often because she cannot hold it. This was a real journey.
    The sad part is that the breeder was not honest with us. Our dog had a passport
    and documents but we did not know what tests should have been done.
  sec: 1557
  time: '25:57'
  who: Sofya
- line: She did not show one specific test related to hyperkeratosis. We found out
    later that it is an inherited allergy that causes the nose and paws to crack and
    bleed which leads to infections. It was terrible because we were anxious and I
    felt guilty for not noticing earlier. We visited vets two or three times a month
    and still did not know the trigger. I track everything about myself, so the lack
    of data for my dog frustrated me.
  sec: 1608
  time: '26:48'
  who: Sofya
- line: I wear an Oura Ring and an Apple Watch and you wear a Garmin so you probably
    understand what I mean. I am obsessed with data and at some point wondered why
    I had nothing similar for my dog. I researched available devices and bought one
    that looked good. It showed steps and calories which was interesting but did not
    solve our problem. We bought a second, a third, and a fourth device, and our dog
    ended up looking like a Christmas tree with trackers around her neck.
  sec: 1674
  time: '27:54'
  who: Sofya
- line: None of them worked for what we needed and that is when we thought it might
    be worth building something ourselves. That is how the journey started. The existing
    devices collected basic data but did not offer tools to explore it deeper. They
    focused on simple and fun metrics to keep users engaged which is fine for subscriptions
    but not enough for real insights. They did not explore the underlying behavioral
    signals at the depth needed for early health detection.
  sec: 1720
  time: '28:40'
  who: Sofya
- line: The early signs of health issues appear in how states evolve over time. Sleep
    fragmentation, subtle restlessness, changes in variability, small shifts in movement
    quality, and variations in movement quantity matter. This is more like anomaly
    detection than simple classification. You need a learned baseline for each specific
    dog before detecting deviations. Dogs differ dramatically from one another even
    within the same breed.
  sec: 1779
  time: '29:39'
  who: Sofya
- header: Dog health monitoring framed as anomaly detection in real world machine
    learning
- line: I imagine tiny dogs bark at everything because they are scared and everything
    around them seems huge. Big dogs act like nothing matters. Even size alone makes
    patterns different and then breeds have inherent diseases so you need to factor
    that in. And on top of that every dog is unique. Your Labrador and her sister
    can have completely different personalities.
  sec: 1924
  time: '32:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. One can run ten kilometers and hide from people while mine is lazy
    and lies on the couch until she hears food. It is not only about personality or
    eating behavior but also about the mental stimulation needed to feel healthy,
    physical activity needs, and sleep patterns. It is similar to people because we
    all differ. I need at least eight hours of sleep while some of my friends feel
    fine with six. They can have interrupted sleep and stay functional while it ruins
    my entire week.
  sec: 1984
  time: '33:04'
  who: Sofya
- line: I can relate to that. What kind of data do you collect. You mentioned movement.
    Is it like steps or something else.
  sec: 2074
  time: '34:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: The device collects IMU data which includes gyroscope, accelerometer, and
    magnetometer readings across all axes. If we talk about activity labels we collect
    time spent active such as walking, playing, and running. We also collect sleeping
    patterns which are complicated. The collar device sits under the dog’s neck and
    tracks its orientation and movement. It is similar to what your watch does when
    tracking your steps and other activities.
  sec: 2082
  time: '34:42'
  who: Sofya
- line: The device tracks its position in space which is not three dimensions but
    twenty seven. By analyzing these patterns we can detect what the dog is doing
    and what is happening. That covers activity and sleep. And sleep fascinates me
    a lot because I am a data driven person.
  sec: 2181
  time: '36:21'
  who: Sofya
- header: Collecting canine data with emphasis on sleep patterns and cycle tracking
- line: We track the sleep cycle. For dogs it is important to account for both night
    and day sleep because both affect energy. We track how much they sleep and how
    their sleep looks, including whether they move a lot during sleep.
  sec: 2225
  time: '37:05'
  who: Sofya
- line: That is with the same device, right? You do not track heart rate here and
    only look at movement. If the dog stays in one position and does not move, that
    may indicate a deep sleep phase.
  sec: 2255
  time: '37:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: We would love to explore heart rate variability. For people optical sensors
    provide rich heart data, but dogs are furry and some breeds are like giant snowballs,
    so we cannot ask owners to shave them. Our new device is very sensitive to breathing
    patterns, which are easier to detect because subtle location changes occur when
    the dog breathes.
  sec: 2272
  time: '37:52'
  who: Sofya
- line: We are still working on it. Distinguishing heart from noise in IMU signals
    is difficult. Runners use chest straps or different sensors that detect heartbeat
    more directly, but chest straps are not practical for many dogs due to fur and
    comfort.
  sec: 2330
  time: '38:50'
  who: Sofya
- line: The core problem is that IMU sensors can capture small movements that may
    correlate with heartbeat, but fur and different heartbeat patterns across breeds
    make reliable extraction hard. For very furry dogs it is complicated to detect
    the heart signal, whereas for lean breeds like Dobermans it is easier and you
    can observe distinct patterns in sensor graphs.
  sec: 2403
  time: '40:03'
  who: Sofya
- line: Is heart rate data necessary?
  sec: 2481
  time: '41:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not always. While heart rate is essential for human health trackers, vets
    use different patterns to identify issues in dogs. Sleep is our second-most important
    metric after weight. Weight is visible but not early enough to catch problems.
    Sleep can reveal pain or issues two to three days before activity changes appear.
  sec: 2487
  time: '41:27'
  who: Sofya
- line: Owners cannot easily observe nocturnal awakenings or sleep twisting, so sleep
    metrics provide vets a rich source to assess pain or whether further tests are
    needed. This is why we frame dog health monitoring as anomaly detection based
    on a learned baseline.
  sec: 2549
  time: '42:29'
  who: Sofya
- header: Establishing a dogs normal baseline through long term data observation
- line: We cannot build a baseline in two or three days; it takes two or three weeks
    to account for environmental distractors. People, weather, a new family member,
    or changed routines affect behavior, so we need time to learn what is normal for
    each dog.
  sec: 2615
  time: '43:35'
  who: Sofya
- line: Once we learn the dog’s normal behavior, deviations help detect anomalies,
    but we must account for aging and contextual changes. It is a continuous journey.
  sec: 2672
  time: '44:32'
  who: Sofya
- line: Can you detect something useful from day one using population-level models
    like Garmin does when it asks age, height, and weight?
  sec: 2699
  time: '44:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. We take into account breed, age, and weight and use population models
    for initial classification tasks such as counting steps, estimating calories,
    and coarse activity labels. But anomaly detection requires learning the individual
    baseline.
  sec: 2741
  time: '45:41'
  who: Sofya
- line: After a few weeks of data we can detect if something seems off for that specific
    dog. That is the core requirement for useful health alerts.
  sec: 2774
  time: '46:14'
  who: Sofya
- line: You said a few weeks. Earlier you mentioned about three weeks. That makes
    sense. I wanted to ask about your transition to full-time startup work because
    I also left a job to focus on a project. How did you decide to leave and focus
    on the idea?
  sec: 2793
  time: '46:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was very difficult and I know it is hard for everyone. I felt my time at
    the daily job was wasted because I wanted to allocate it to something important
    to me and my partner. I lived with that thought for more than a year and was terrified
    to leave stability.
  sec: 2840
  time: '47:20'
  who: Sofya
- line: 'I was attached to my team and the social stability; we had many activities
    and a safe zone. The alternative was to pretend it was not important, which felt
    worse. Financial reality matters too: you need money to live, and London is expensive.'
  sec: 2898
  time: '48:18'
  who: Sofya
- header: Startup funding through personal savings and early stage bootstrapping
- line: I had savings and my husband supported me, so I took the leap and pursued
    Fit Tails full time. We chose not to take investment before shipping a product
    because raising funds would take about a year, whereas we could bootstrap and
    solve the real problem now.
  sec: 2974
  time: '49:34'
  who: Sofya
- line: We did spend money on prototypes and faced hardware troubles; some of that
    was wasted but we learned a lot. Eventually we will need investment to manufacture
    devices at scale because producing physical products requires capital. Kickstarter
    works for some cases but larger production needs funding.
  sec: 3036
  time: '50:36'
  who: Sofya
- line: With software you can bootstrap more easily, but for hardware you need capital.
    What prototypes did you build and how did you design them? Arduinos are large,
    so how did you create the first device?
  sec: 3109
  time: '51:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first version used samples from AliExpress; we assembled components to
    see if we could capture useful signals and understand the data. Even clumsy prototypes
    provided initial insights. My dog was the tester from day one and adapted to wearing
    the collar because dogs already wear collars for walks.
  sec: 3146
  time: '52:26'
  who: Sofya
- line: Initial prototypes were heavier, but our current device is around 36 grams,
    which is negligible for dogs above three kilograms. We soldered early units at
    home and disassembled commercial devices to identify components such as ESP32
    modules.
  sec: 3206
  time: '53:26'
  who: Sofya
- line: We realized scaling requires more reliable parts and manufacturing, so we
    worked with an outsourcing company and faced mismatched expectations, timelines,
    and budgets. It was a learning journey and not always pleasant, but everyone goes
    through it.

- line: You keep saying we. Who do you mean? Your husband and you or somebody else
    in the team?

  who: Alexey
- line: We have a team of five. It is me, my husband who advises and helps me, and
    several former colleagues. Everyone else I found at meetups and they help with
    different parts of the work.

  who: Sofya
- line: I cannot disclose all the names, but they work on coding, the application,
    design, interviewing people, and marketing. It cannot be done by two people alone
    so we needed a team in the beginning. I am thankful that I found people who are
    motivated to solve this problem and take on the challenge.

  sec: 3388
  time: '56:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Meetups mostly. I am a fan of going wherever life takes me. If I see an interesting
    event I go. Web Summit was a perfect example, though there are too many people
    to find someone properly there.

  time: '56:34'
  who: Sofya
- line: It is complicated to have a long conversation in that environment. I think
    we only talked for about five minutes before more people joined and we lost the
    thread. The entire day was like that.

  time: '56:52'
  who: Sofya
- line: Because of that I go to small meetups. I went to many in Latvia. In Latvia
    we had a place called Startup House, a co-working space only for startups. It
    is amazing because you share knowledge and chat over coffee about the challenges
    you are solving.

  time: '57:22'
  who: Sofya
- line: It was a great decision for me to move from an office to a co-working space
    because I met people around me. After hours there were many events like pancake
    breakfasts, presentations, pitches, marketing talks, and coding evenings. These
    events help you get to know people, share challenges, and understand who might
    be a good team member or who knows someone who could be.

  who: Alexey
- line: It is related because I see more opportunities here. The market is huge.
  sec: 3534
  time: '58:54'
  who: Sofya
- line: And I guess when it comes to finding investors London is active. My friends
    there tell me about the meetups for startup founders and people interested in
    startups. Every week there are several events.
  sec: 3540
  time: '59:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Berlin is similar but the scale is smaller because the city is smaller than
    London. I see that we are already out of time. This conversation flew by and it
    was amazing, but we should wrap up.

    your educational background, and how you created the first prototype and got to
    the device you have now. Thanks for joining us and telling your story. I wish
    you great success.

    The holiday season is starting, though not for people who run companies because
    we keep working. For the rest of you, enjoy the holidays and see you soon.
