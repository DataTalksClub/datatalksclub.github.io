title: From Marketing to Product Owner in Search
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about transitioning from marketing to being a product
    owner in search. And we have a very special guest today Valeria. Valeria is a
    product owner with a focus on e-commerce, site search optimization, analytics,
    team management, and product development – and I think there are more things that
    I omitted because your biography is quite long and extensive. Today, Valeria will
    share her experience with us. Welcome!

  who: Lera
- header: Lera’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of transitioning from marketing to being
    a product owner, let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your
    career journey so far?
  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: What do you mean by career journey?
  sec: 121
  time: '2:01'
  who: Lera
- line: Your journey of how you ended up in the place where you are right now. What
    did you do before?
  sec: 126
  time: '2:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, okay – fine. Well, as you learned before, I started with marketing. Actually,
    I was always focused on IT. Working in Product was my vision of my career, but
    to start being a product manager/product owner, you need to start from somewhere.
    Basically, there was an opportunity to join Ringostat, which is a SaaS that provides
    analytics and call-tracking for marketers. They had an open position of marketer
    – it was like performance marketing, so I was in charge of doing promotions and
    doing some events. My responsibility was to acquire leads – to generate leads
    and to make them our customers.
  sec: 134
  time: '2:14'
  who: Lera
- line: For example, some very interesting stuff that I did – our customers were B2B
    (other companies) and marketing the work for e-commerce as well. I did some interesting
    events, for example, there was a rating of PPC agencies. That's how I grabbed
    the attention of all our customers and provided something of value for them. For
    this rating stuff, we also acquired leads. My first step in Performance Marketing
    was acquiring leads and making promotions and all this advertising stuff. So after
    Ringostat, I went to another company. It was a logistic holding. We have eight
    companies inside this holding. Basically, it was about transportation, about oil
    (we have gas stations) and they also have e-commerce that sells car parts. That
    was a little bit of a journey for my career.
  sec: 134
  time: '2:14'
  who: Lera
- line: Basically, it was a small marketing department and we also did pretty much
    everything. I was also in charge of Performance Marketing and we did some promotions
    for each company. For example, we did a promotion for a logistics company, made
    events, and so on. Also, it was like internal outsourcing marketing for all these
    companies in the holding. The other great task was to make branding for gas stations.
    I also loved this task because I was analyzing and making a “job to be done” framework,
    creating great messaging in our branding, and we released this branding. The other
    task was to launch a website that sells car parts. We were limited in our assortment
    – we just sold tires. This e-commerce was also B2B because we sold to logistic
    companies. It was stuff for trucks. We sold batteries for huge trucks, tires for
    them, and oil, and all this stuff. I worked there for one year. It was based in
    Odesa, Ukraine.
  sec: 134
  time: '2:14'
  who: Lera
- line: As you know, in 2020, the war in Ukraine started. Because I was in marketing,
    it's become… I realized I needed to move to Europe, because of the situation there.
    That's how I left my job at the previous company. I realized it was marketing
    for the internal market in Ukraine, and so I would need to change my whole career
    – to change everything I was doing – and to move to another country to focus more
    on the international position. This was where the challenge began. Basically,
    I didn’t really have experience being a product owner. I didn't have much experience
    in e-commerce because my e-commerce experience was for B2B users. It was not about
    promotions and stuff. I didn't have much of this experience. That's where the
    journey was about breaking barriers in your head.
  sec: 134
  time: '2:14'
  who: Lera
- line: So, I was trying to find a new job because I lost mine. I did several interviews,
    and while I was doing interviews, I actually started learning to code. I was learning,
    for example, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while I was in this transition period
    – I wanted to learn to code more. I really had time for this, too. It was mind-blowing
    for me at first. It was hard. I really struggled to learn how to code. But basically,
    I ended up in a position where I could code a website, for example. When I was
    looking for a new job I used this time to learn new stuff – it was hard stuff
    for me because it was completely different from what I did before.
  sec: 134
  time: '2:14'
  who: Lera
- line: How I joined AUTODOC is a great story. I just tried different channels of
    how to find a new job and I wrote to my colleague, with whom we used to work at
    Ringostat. I just wrote to him, “How are you doing? How are you doing with this
    whole situation in Ukraine? Where are you now?” And he said, “I'm working at AUTODOC
    right now.” And asked, “Yeah, actually I'm looking for jobs. Maybe you have some
    open positions, guys?” And he said “Yeah, why not? I should ask people.” The recruiter
    sent me a job description and it had nothing to actually do with my knowledge
    – it was so different.
  sec: 134
  time: '2:14'
  who: Lera
- line: It was the product owner position, right?
  sec: 566
  time: '9:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Yeah, it was a product owner position. The requirements were something
    like being a product owner in e-commerce for two years, knowing a lot about car
    parts, and everything like that. [cross-talk]
  sec: 568
  time: '9:28'
  who: Lera
- line: But you knew something about car parts already from your previous logistics
    experience. [Lera agrees] So it was still a match, to some extent, right?
  sec: 580
  time: '9:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I use this experience to sell myself [chuckles] and to be more relevant.
    We went to some interviews and I think they liked me. So that's how I joined AUTODOC.
    From the beginning, at AUTODOC, I can share my challenges regarding how to transform
    a new position from the lack of… [cross-talk]
  sec: 587
  time: '9:47'
  who: Lera
- line: Yeah, I definitely have questions about that.
  sec: 620
  time: '10:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Okay.
  sec: 622
  time: '10:22'
  who: Lera
- header: Lera’s move from Ukraine to Germany
- line: I'm just curious. When the war started and you left Ukraine, did he go immediately
    to Berlin? Or did you go to some other place?
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, no. It was hard to find an apartment, actually. Maybe you know something
    about this. We started from a small town in Germany, but then I realized it was
    too small to live there, so we went to Breslau. And from Breslau, then I moved
    to Berlin. But I moved to Berlin while already having been employed at AUTODOC.
  sec: 631
  time: '10:31'
  who: Lera
- line: Aha, so you have offices in both Breslau and Berlin.
  sec: 658
  time: '10:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: We don't have offices in Breslau, it's remote.
  sec: 662
  time: '11:02'
  who: Lera
- line: Okay. So you lived in Breslau, you contacted your ex-colleague from the previous
    company, and he forwarded you a job description. You didn't really fit this job
    description, but you still tried to interview and got this job, and then eventually
    moved to Berlin.
  sec: 666
  time: '11:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's true.
  sec: 682
  time: '11:22'
  who: Lera
- line: Okay. I think I interrupted you. You wanted to tell us about the challenges,
    right? Your prior experience was in performance marketing. [Lera agrees] You were
    talking about things like PPC campaigns, which is… What does it mean, actually?
    PPC?
  sec: 684
  time: '11:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Pay per click.
  sec: 703
  time: '11:43'
  who: Lera
- header: The transition from Marketing to Product Ownership
- line: Pay per click! Exactly. And now you're a product owner, right? Which is… I
    don't know how related it is to Performance Marketing. Maybe there is some relation,
    maybe not. But I'm curious, what were the challenges? How did you transition?
    What did you need to do for this?
  sec: 704
  time: '11:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's an interesting part. The first challenge was that I needed to
    learn a lot. I spent… I worked a lot. I worked until late-late evening to become
    an expert in this field. I learned from very different perspectives. For example,
    first, I needed to learn what product ownership is. I took a bunch of courses.
    For example, there was a special course for product ownership in Ukraine – I wanted
    to take a deep dive into this role and what it actually means and… [cross-talk]
  sec: 726
  time: '12:06'
  who: Lera
- line: But you were already employed. [Lera agrees] So you already got hired and
    you thought, “Okay, what is this product owner thing?” [chuckles] “Let me check.”
  sec: 775
  time: '12:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah, that''s a funny part. But I really did a lot to learn. I
    read so many books. For example, there is a book called Professional Product Owner.
    It describes what the role of product owner is. Basically, the product owner is
    a role in Scrum. But in our company, the product owner is more of a product manager.
    It''s just a title, but we do pretty much everything that the product manager
    does. Currently, we are in a tech transformation, and our titles would actually
    be product managers. Really, the first thing I did was take a deep dive into what
    the product owner role is and what this person does. I went to courses, and I
    was reading books – I’ve done a lot of this. I have some knowledge on how… For
    example, in my previous companies [of employment], people were doing the same
    thing.'
  sec: 784
  time: '13:04'
  who: Lera
- line: At Ringostat, we had pretty much the same positions. It was the Visionary
    Officer and the Project Manager. I basically grabbed some patterns from those
    people and put those patterns into doing this role. Then I took a really deeper
    dive into this role. The second challenge… I also wanted to say that, when you
    transition from another position, one thing that would be super helpful is to
    build connections with your colleagues and your coworkers because those people
    will help you. They will teach you. My tip for this is to learn from everyone.
    I learned a lot from Quality Assurance Engineers. They taught me about the product.
    I also learned a lot from engineers – from them, I learned the logic of the product
    and the search. I also learned from business analysts and I learned a lot from
    data analysts.
  sec: 784
  time: '13:04'
  who: Lera
- line: I communicate with a cross-functional team and I spend really, really quality
    time in one-on-one meetings. So build connections, learn from them, and deeply
    understand the product. If I were to give a tip to myself back when I started,
    it would be to communicate more – to do more one-on-ones and communicate with
    different people, at different levels. They will all generate new insights – they
    will teach you how to be more insightful and more productive. Learn internal stuff
    in the company to understand the context. What else do I need to share? Basically,
    about how I learned data – for example, data analysis.
  sec: 784
  time: '13:04'
  who: Lera
- header: The importance of communication and one-on-ones
- line: I'm curious about a few things. You mentioned you had two problems. The first
    problem was that you needed to learn a lot. What you did to solve that was take
    courses, and worked into late evenings – you tried to immerse yourself in the
    job to learn as much as possible. Then the second thing was building connections.
    You would speak with pretty much everyone in the company to learn from them –
    how they work, what they work on, what kind of problems they have, and learn about
    the company. I think this thing (this communication) these one-on-one meetings
    are really important for everyone, regardless of the role, be it product manager,
    product owner, data scientist, software engineer – anyone. So I'm just curious,
    for these one-on-one meetings – let's say you want to speak with a QA engineer
    or a business analyst or a data analyst.
  sec: 996
  time: '16:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: How do you structure this meeting? First, I guess you need to approach a person
    saying, “Hey, Martin, (or Hey, Theresa). I want to have a one-on-one meeting with
    you.” Right? So you agree to a meeting. But then, what happens next? How do you
    structure this meeting? How do you get the most out of this meeting? Is it just
    free-form or do you have some structure?
  sec: 996
  time: '16:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I want to share a specific case. When I joined, they already had development
    going on – they had a specific feature to deliver. Basically, I realized that
    we kind of had a miscommunication with one developer – we just didn't hear each
    other. I understood that we could not find common ground – I said one thing, he
    said another, and we were losing time. We did communications in JIRA and the communication
    just wasn't aligned. So I decided to set up a one-on-one meeting to fix the situation
    and find common ground.
  sec: 1075
  time: '17:55'
  who: Lera
- line: With the developer, right?
  sec: 1132
  time: '18:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'With the developer – right. The structure was like this: I will try to remember
    the questions I asked him. For example, I asked him what his vision of the best
    product owner was – what did he expect from me, being the product owner? The second
    question was, “Who do you consider to be the best product owner in the company?”
    He described what he expected from me and he described a great product owner who
    was already in our company – whom I needed to learn from.'
  sec: 1133
  time: '18:53'
  who: Lera
- line: What I learned from him was that a product owner was supposed to be more confident
    and pushier – to be a leader – and he said that was lacking for me. This was great
    feedback. Developers need a person (a product owner) who will be a great leader.
    Also, we were making some small talk – we talked about things outside of the job.
    I actually learned that he loved tennis and I also play tennis, so we made some
    small talk about tennis.
  sec: 1133
  time: '18:53'
  who: Lera
- line: You connected on this basis.
  sec: 1223
  time: '20:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Sorry?'
  sec: 1226
  time: '20:26'
  who: Lera
- line: You connected because you share the same hobby. So you made a connection.
  sec: 1227
  time: '20:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I asked him to give me some tips on how to improve my job and what I
    do [for him]. He shared his opinion. I also asked how we could improve our work
    process and what he thought our gaps were. I just wanted to collect his feedback.
    This feedback was really important to me, naturally, and I really wanted him to
    just share his concerns and everything. After everything, after this meeting,
    this person said, “Yeah, okay. I understand you.” He wasn't angry anymore.
  sec: 1230
  time: '20:30'
  who: Lera
- line: He understood that I just came there and I was a newbie. He said, “Okay, you
    will learn. Okay, Valerie – I'm fine with you. It's okay.” So in one hour, you
    can build the connection and that's how you take it step-by-step and become a
    better specialist – more mature, more confident. You learn more. Now, if you compare
    me with the person I was in the beginning – it’s two different people. [chuckles]
  sec: 1230
  time: '20:30'
  who: Lera
- header: The role of Product Owner
- line: So you needed to find common ground with the developer and you couldn't find
    it. Maybe this is more like a “step back” question because we did not really discuss
    what product owners do. I was wondering, why was it important to have good communication
    with this developer? What's the role of a product owner?
  sec: 1313
  time: '21:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we didn’t discuss this. [chuckles]
  sec: 1337
  time: '22:17'
  who: Lera
- line: You said that you took a lot of courses to figure out what your job actually
    is. So, what is your job?
  sec: 1339
  time: '22:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] It''s a funny one. The funniest thing is how [different] product
    owners are from what they’re considered to be in literature and how they are in
    real life. I think it''s kind of different. I will share with you the reality
    of e-commerce, actually. As I said before, I''m in charge of search, which is
    when you type something and search in e-commerce. One part of that is monitoring
    the metrics. Basically, I''m in charge of keeping an eye on the existing products.
    We are e-commerce, so we already have our search working. The first thing I need
    to do is monitor our day-to-day metrics – our conversion rate, the search popularity,
    and all this stuff. This is one part of my job. If there are some critical bugs,
    I need to fix them somehow – to find a developer and to avoid making the company
    losing money.'
  sec: 1347
  time: '22:27'
  who: Lera
- line: I'm in charge of making sure that the functionality works fine. Sometimes
    we do have some issues, for example, with updating products. I also need to control.
    This is simply one part. The other part (the real product owner/product manager
    part) is we need to have a clear vision of where we are going – where our product
    is going. You need to have a detailed roadmap with those JIRA Epics and User Stories.
    The product owner prioritizes… The product owner is a value maximizer – this person
    needs to prioritize the most valuable features and say, “We’re doing this first,
    and the next feature would be this one.” Basically, it’s roadmapping, planning,
    defining the vision of the product and the strategy – that’s basically the product
    owner’s role.
  sec: 1347
  time: '22:27'
  who: Lera
- line: The other thing I need to do is team management. I think I can say that I
    sometimes perform the role of a Scrum Master or Project Manager, which is how
    you just organize the work to deliver some features. Frankly speaking, we don’t
    have unstoppable development – what I want to say is that we have some initiatives
    that we deliver. For example, this year, there was some time when we didn't actively
    work on search because the company had different initiatives, such as migrating
    from a regular website to an adaptive website. I was taking on the responsibility
    of transitioning the existing website to an adaptive website. I didn't participate
    as a Scrum Master in this kind of initiative – I was doing a different role.
  sec: 1347
  time: '22:27'
  who: Lera
- line: Sometimes we have initiatives that are very dedicated to search, for example,
    delivering filters, or a new auto-complete. For these kinds of parts, I take on
    the role of Scrum Master to organize our development process. I also do this kind
    of stuff. I mentioned roadmapping, but I didn't mention that I do research as
    well. Basically, I monitor competitors, I read a lot about search – I was very
    surprised that search is such a deep, deep topic. You need to know about machine
    learning, natural [language] processing, you need to know about algorithms, about
    Elasticsearch, and how to do the autocomplete, you need to know about product
    structure and all the attributes of the searches.
  sec: 1347
  time: '22:27'
  who: Lera
- line: Also, you need to know the users, actually – what's the business context of
    search, what problems are users trying to solve by searching for car parts, for
    example? You need to know different query types. For example, users can search
    in different ways – they can search by part numbers (OEM numbers) or they can
    search by part name, or they just type something like, “I want brake pads Brembo
    on my Audi a4,” and you need to know how to make your search understand all the
    semantics.
  sec: 1347
  time: '22:27'
  who: Lera
- line: That’s a lot. [Lera agrees] You’ve been talking for 10 minutes and I'm taking
    notes – the entire page is filled with what you do. [chuckles]
  sec: 1664
  time: '27:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I'm jumping a lot. I want to structure it a little bit. First, it's
    to monitor how things are going right now, under the current project. Second,
    you need to do research and understand users, understand competitors, and understand
    patterns of users’ searches. The other part is team management – how to organize
    the work. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1672
  time: '27:52'
  who: Lera
- header: Utilizing Scrum as a Product Owner
- line: You follow Scrum, right? All these estimating meetings, daily stand-ups, retrospectives
    – you organize all that, right?
  sec: 1710
  time: '28:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, depending on the initiatives we have. If we, for example, have to deliver
    filters – we need two developers and two QA engineers, and that's pretty much
    it. For this kind of development process, for example, we did stand-ups, planning,
    and retrospectives. But for the other initiative, we needed to investigate new
    technologies, so you don't really need all these ceremonies. You just do Kanban,
    where it's “needs to be done,” “in progress,” “done”. For different initiatives,
    it’s different types of…
  sec: 1727
  time: '28:47'
  who: Lera
- line: From what I understood, you work with multiple teams, right?
  sec: 1787
  time: '29:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's the interesting part. Because right now, we don't really have
    a super-dedicated search team. But I'm looking forward to having one. Before we
    just took developers for some initiatives. For example, for some kind of initiative,
    you just grab some people – to deliver this feature, you need those people and
    you acquire those people – you have this initiative and you deliver it. But we
    are going to have dedicated teams – for example, dedicated to search – because
    now, in our roadmap, we have natural language processing, we have machine learning,
    and I think it requires a lot of context understanding. That's why I’m trying
    to form a team around search right now.
  sec: 1790
  time: '29:50'
  who: Lera
- line: So, right now, in addition to all these things you mentioned, you're also
    building a search team.
  sec: 1855
  time: '30:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah! [chuckles]
  sec: 1860
  time: '31:00'
  who: Lera
- header: Building teams and cross-functionality
- line: Okay, I just want to summarize what you said. First, you monitor business
    health (search health) if I can say that. [Lera agrees] The second thing is, you're
    doing research, you're talking with users, you're watching what competitors are
    doing so you know if you need any new features or things like that. Then you do
    this team operational stuff, which is Scrum/Kanban – all these processes and rituals.
    Then you mentioned a more strategic part, or defining a clear vision of where
    you're going, and then from that vision, building a roadmap – that's another thing.
  sec: 1862
  time: '31:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Then, I remember you talked about actually learning all these things – learning
    about NLP, learning about machine learning. And now I think I understand why –
    because you need to build a team and you want to know what kind of things they
    need to know. Right? What kind of experience you need in the team, what kind of
    knowledge you need in the team – you need to know that in order to build the team.
  sec: 1862
  time: '31:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For example, I need to know natural language processing is data science
    stuff. Actually, it's not just me. You might have the impression that I do all
    this stuff and it's like a T-shaped person. But we still have, for example, the
    research team – at AUTODOC, there is the research department and they do in-depth
    analytics and all this stuff. So I don't do it by myself. I don't do user interviews,
    as you said – we have a special department for that. And also we have… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1936
  time: '32:16'
  who: Lera
- line: You still need to know that, “There was this interview, and this is the outcome
    of this interview. These were the questions.” And perhaps you even watch the videos
    of the interview to see how users actually use the app and then you see, “Okay,
    something is wrong here. Maybe we should change the flow of the search.” Right?
  sec: 1977
  time: '32:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that’s true. My message was that I don't do it by myself, but we have
    a special department for this. But I still need to read these studies and everything.
  sec: 1994
  time: '33:14'
  who: Lera
- line: It’s just that you don't code yourself, but you need to translate what the
    researchers found into what actually needs to happen. You’re this glue that kind
    of links these departments. Right?
  sec: 2007
  time: '33:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I say that being a product manager is like being a mini-CEO of the product.
    Maybe you've heard this and it's true – you’re kind of responsible for everything
    and if you have some kind of issues with the product, you need to react. That's
    a tricky position, I know. But it's still very interesting. Some people like this
    – more generalists and T-shaped people – I like to learn from different perspectives.
    So I think this is fine for me, to not be a super-narrow specialist, but more
    of a wide person.
  sec: 2025
  time: '33:45'
  who: Lera
- header: Lera’s experience learning about search
- line: How do you keep up with all that? You mentioned that, in addition to all that,
    you also need to learn about all this machine learning stuff. Actually, this is
    how I found you. There was a post that you made about Relevant Search – the book.
    Duke, the author, liked the post and it appeared in my feed. Duke was already
    a guest multiple times at DataTalks.Club. I saw his reaction and then I read the
    post and I thought, “Hmm… Interesting. I should invite Valeria.” So why did you…
  sec: 2072
  time: '34:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: The book is called Relevant Search and, as far as I remember, the book is
    about – it's a very technical book. [Lera agrees] It's about using Elasticsearch.
    It's Elasticsearch, right? It’s a search engine for building searches. So how
    did you come across this book? Why did you decide to read it?
  sec: 2072
  time: '34:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's good to mention. It’s because I see that I need to understand
    all this stuff to communicate with developers, for example. I was in some communities
    of Elastic, and I saw that people were sharing this book. Actually, this book
    is promoted to be a good one – like the Bible of Search or something. I found
    that it's pretty useful to read about search. Regarding why I wrote this post
    – because, in the introduction of this book, they just pointed out some of my
    pain points. They just described the importance of search and how hard search
    is. [chuckles]
  sec: 2128
  time: '35:28'
  who: Lera
- line: The main point is relevance, which is very connected to the business context.
    You need to educate developers to understand the business context because you
    cannot just build a relevant search from scratch – you need to tune the search
    to be relevant. You also need to give the developers this context – what is relevant
    for users, for example. I really like this thought, this expression. We need to
    work on relevance. You cannot just grab some universal search and it will be super
    fine. You need to tune it for your business. That's what I wanted to post on LinkedIn
    – this thought that I really liked. The second part of the post was about cross-functional
    collaboration. So it's not about requirement-driven development, it's more about
    a product mindset – everyone should understand, as I said, the business context
    and why it's important for users to get these kinds of results.
  sec: 2128
  time: '35:28'
  who: Lera
- line: I expect my developers to have a deep understanding of the business context.
    I actually create those meetings, where I try to explain to developers why we're
    doing this, what the problems of the users we’re solving, and what search actually
    means. Even today, I will have this meeting and I want to show them, for example,
    that the users can search by catalog – they can navigate by catalog, and it’s
    a different way to search for car parts by text. I want them to understand this,
    that it's not about just text, it's about users solving their problems.
  sec: 2128
  time: '35:28'
  who: Lera
- line: I imagine, if we’re talking about this domain of car parts, it's a pretty
    complex one. Let's say you have a specific car model/make – Volkswagen, for example
    (I'm not really into cars) – I don't know, some specific model.
  sec: 2313
  time: '38:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s okay. That's fine. [chuckles]
  sec: 2327
  time: '38:47'
  who: Lera
- line: And then you need a specific part that would fit this exact car, right? You
    not only need to know the name of this car part, but also the model and make of
    the car for which you need the part. I can imagine that it becomes pretty complex
    at some point, right?
  sec: 2329
  time: '38:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, for this point, we have the user journey. The users need to… For example,
    we have this cool feature, where you just insert your license plate number and
    our vehicle selector will identify the vehicle by this license plate. For some
    countries, we have this feature, and I think it's super user-friendly. You just
    type 6 points. Now, when your car is identified on our website, you can just search
    for stuff and you will have only the car parts suitable for your car. It works
    like this. You first identify your car and then you can search for stuff and the
    products that our website shows you fit your car.
  sec: 2348
  time: '39:08'
  who: Lera
- header: The importance of having both technical knowledge and business context
- line: Well, you need to have this business context – you need to know this business
    context in order to arrive at this solution, right? Without it, you would come
    up with just a general search bar and you will be like, “Oh, I don't know. I need
    a compressor for…” I don't know if there is such a thing. I know that there are
    compressors in fridges. [chuckles] Whatever part name for whatever model and then,
    “Okay, why is it not working? Why is it showing me this part for another Volkswagen?”
    Right?
  sec: 2411
  time: '40:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah. Right now, at AUTODOC, we still have some gaps. But there’s
    a roadmap to fill those gaps. [chuckles] For example, you can buy a product without
    identifying the car – you can’t do it right now. And it''s our task to solve –
    to make it more user-friendly, to provide users the ability… We need to make a
    website to make it clearer and understand users need to pick a car to find the
    right one. It''s quite a common pattern. You can search, for example, “brake disc
    for Audi” and that''s it, without specifying which Audi. We are now making machine
    learning features with natural language processing that will identify the car
    part maker or model in a search query and offer the user more information about
    the car to make the whole journey easier. We have this feature in development.'
  sec: 2441
  time: '40:41'
  who: Lera
- line: This is quite a technical feature. It includes knowing what natural language
    processing is, what parsing is, and extracting things from there. How technical
    do you need to be? How much do you, as a product owner, need to know about that?
    Is it more like a “nice to have” or is it actually a very important skill in your
    case?
  sec: 2539
  time: '42:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I also went to… maybe you know this conference – it is about search,
    called Haystack.
  sec: 2559
  time: '42:39'
  who: Lera
- line: Yeah. Is it also in Berlin?
  sec: 2568
  time: '42:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah! It's in Berlin. It's a really technical conference. It’s for developers.
    and I also go there to understand the technical aspects. You know what helps?
    ChatGPT helps a lot, actually. What I do is, for example, I'm reading a technical
    book and I don't really understand what information retrieval is. So I just go
    to ChatGPT and say, “Hey, ChatGPT! What is information retrieval in the context
    of car part search?” Ah, inverted index! Not information retrieval – inverted
    index! “What does inverted index mean in the context of car part search? Explain
    it to me like I’m 5.” [chuckles] I'm just kidding.
  sec: 2571
  time: '42:51'
  who: Lera
- line: That’s a very important part, right? “Explain like I’m five.” [chuckles]
  sec: 2620
  time: '43:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so it gives a simple explanation – ChatGPT gives me very simple examples
    I can understand. That's a cool part. I think the more technical of a person you
    are, the better. I'm trying to dig deep into technical stuff – I really try to
    understand what natural language processing is from a technical standpoint. I
    think the more you are in tech, the better – but still, the basics help you to
    communicate with people and to give them context, for general understanding.
  sec: 2623
  time: '43:43'
  who: Lera
- line: For example, I need to know what a natural language processing task does.
    I know it's spelling correction, I know it's named entity recognition – the natural
    processing makes tokenization of the query, whether it's a brand name or a car
    part name or its number – this task calls to natural language processing. So yeah,
    I think it’s mandatory to learn the basics but the more you are in tech, the better.
  sec: 2623
  time: '43:43'
  who: Lera
- line: I guess it also depends on the field of your work. Since you work in e-commerce
    search, for you, it makes sense to go and learn about search. If somebody works
    in some other domain, maybe they would need to learn about some other things.
    But still, for a product owner, it's important to know the technical parts of…
    I'm trying to think of an example.
  sec: 2709
  time: '45:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let's say that it’s a product owner in the moderation team and the moderation
    team uses machine learning to identify things that shouldn't be posted on the
    website. For them, it's probably important to know how machine learning can be
    used for this and what machine learning actually is. This is similar to your case.
    [Lera agrees] You mentioned you found this book when you were in a search community.
    [Lera agrees] So you were already a part of technical search communities, and
    you came across this book.
  sec: 2709
  time: '45:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, in Telegram, they have an Elasticsearch group, and I am part of this
    group. Actually, we are always looking forward to developers and that's why. There
    are people sharing and this is how I learned. On GitHub, I also saw a bunch of
    books about Elasticsearch, and this book was the first on the list. So that's
    how I realized that I really need to read this one because there’s so much social
    proof on it. [chuckles]
  sec: 2767
  time: '46:07'
  who: Lera
- header: Open developer positions at AUTODOC
- line: Yeah. You said you're looking for developers right now?
  sec: 2802
  time: '46:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we are. [chuckles]
  sec: 2807
  time: '46:47'
  who: Lera
- line: So what's the profile that you're looking for? You mentioned that it's a fully
    remote position, right? I heard in our community, in DataTalks.Club, many people
    say, “Hey, I really want to have a fully remote job, but it's always US-based
    (remote but in the US).” So what kind of remote…? Or is it not remote?
  sec: 2809
  time: '46:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: We have offices across Europe, across Ukraine, and even in other countries.
    If you live in the city, you can go to the office – it's fine. We do have an office
    in Berlin. Our tech hub is actually in Lisbon. This previous week, I was there
    at a product event. You can work remotely, but you can also go to the office if
    you live in the city [where there is one].
  sec: 2832
  time: '47:12'
  who: Lera
- line: You lived in Breslau and you worked and you worked remotely, right? So that’s
    also possible.
  sec: 2863
  time: '47:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. What I did was… I actually invest, I think, in traveling around Europe
    and seeing people offline and connecting with them. Because I think it's also
    crucial to make these offline connections. I've pretty much been in some offices
    at AUTODOC already.
  sec: 2868
  time: '47:48'
  who: Lera
- line: Well, please share the links to the job descriptions. Maybe there is somebody
    who is an experienced search engineer, who's listening to us right now and would
    love to join your team.
  sec: 2895
  time: '48:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah. Why not?
  sec: 2906
  time: '48:26'
  who: Lera
- header: What experience Lera came to AUTODOC with
- line: I see that we have some questions. The question is – maybe we already answered
    that – “Did you have the Scrum Master experience and project management experience
    before this job? Or did you pick it up on the job and learn as you went?”
  sec: 2909
  time: '48:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I learned as I went. But, as I mentioned before, I had a great pattern.
    Even at the start, we had a great project manager – she was also a Scrum Master.
    Before coming [to AUTODOC], I already knew all about Scrum ceremonies. I saw how
    people did stand-ups, how people did retrospectives, how they did planning, and
    I've seen it and I have great patterns of how it can be done. What I did was just
    read the Scrum guide and I also went to Scrum training.
  sec: 2926
  time: '48:46'
  who: Lera
- line: I knew just the theoretical part of this and I tried to learn it on the fly.
    You just need to be a great talker, I think. If you know the basics, you just
    need to be a great public speaker for this role, because you always need to keep
    your guys motivated and involved in the project. And you do it by being this energetic
    person – being this serving leader. So you learn the basics and then you… Basically,
    to sum it up, I have previous experience of how people did it and I saw how it
    worked. Then I read books about Scrum – not just the Scrum guide. I went to Scrum
    training. And I just started doing it.
  sec: 2926
  time: '48:46'
  who: Lera
- line: For me, the most interesting part is that they decided to hire you even though
    you had no experience in these areas, which probably means that maybe being an
    experienced Scrum Master is not important – and you already proved that – you
    can pick the skills up on the job. But do you know what they actually looked at
    when deciding to hire you? What kind of skills were they interested in when making
    this decision?
  sec: 3049
  time: '50:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Historically, at AUTODOC, people that are now in a product ownership position
    came from marketing. My boss also came from marketing, and her boss came from
    marketing. So that's why – those people always had a marketing background. It's
    okay to transition from marketing to product ownership. Probably, if we had product
    owners come from developers, they would never have actually hired me because they
    would be biased about me. I think that played a big role. Because historically,
    product owners at AUTODOC came from marketing.
  sec: 3078
  time: '51:18'
  who: Lera
- header: How marketing skills helped Lera in her current role
- line: Which skills, that you already had from your marketing past, helped you in
    your current role?
  sec: 3129
  time: '52:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first one is understanding… I think what’s common in marketing and product
    management is understanding the user. For example, doing “job to be done” frameworks,
    understanding customer journeys, understanding customer likes, pains, cases, and
    customer needs – all this customer development stuff is present in both marketing
    and in product. Basically, I already had this kind of knowledge and it's cool.
    The second one I want to share is very interesting – when you work in a super
    huge company like AUTODOC (we have 3000 people) it's not the same as working at
    a small startup.
  sec: 3136
  time: '52:16'
  who: Lera
- line: What the difference is – people don't know you, and people don't know about
    your product either. I think the crucial role of a product manager in a big company
    is to be a PR manager of your product – to be a marketer of your product, an internal
    marketer. Make people learn about your product, and about the benefits of your
    product. There is a certain department in a company that’s responsible for the
    search. In a small company, everybody knows and it's obvious, but in a super-huge
    company, it's not obvious. You just need to shine. That's why I post on LinkedIn,
    that's why I traveled to communicate with other people.
  sec: 3136
  time: '52:16'
  who: Lera
- line: Because when it comes to working in a huge company, you need to scale your
    brand awareness and the awareness of your project. That's where marketing helped
    me, because I used my social media to talk about search, and used these techniques
    to educate people about my product. We are all working remotely, so information…
    We are a little bit isolated. For me, LinkedIn posts are like a virtual version
    of communication in our office.
  sec: 3136
  time: '52:16'
  who: Lera
- line: That's why you post selfies, right?
  sec: 3301
  time: '55:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's kind of my trick. I understand the importance. Across a big company,
    you need to talk more about your product publicly. That generates… For example,
    people from assortment come to me to solve certain problems. It generates new
    connections and new ideas. That's why I think it's crucial. To grow in a big company,
    you need to be a little bit of a PR manager of yourself, your product, and your
    team as well.
  sec: 3304
  time: '55:04'
  who: Lera
- line: That's how your marketing skills helped, right? [Lera agrees] Because you
    already knew how to market something, “Okay! Let's think about what I can do to
    be more noticeable within the company.” Right? [Lera agrees] “Let’s run a PPC
    campaign.” [laughs]
  sec: 3353
  time: '55:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Just kidding. The other thing I wanted to add is that you also need
    to sell your ideas. Because when the company is huge and there are so many initiatives,
    the top management needs to pick some initiatives that will generate more revenue.
    That’s how prioritization works. Sometimes you don''t really know how this feature
    will deliver money in the future – you’re selling the future. For project management,
    you need to be a great salesperson. You need to encourage and to believe in this
    perfect future – to generate revenue and stuff.'
  sec: 3369
  time: '56:09'
  who: Lera
- line: Because you’re selling the future, sometimes it’s obvious what the outcome
    of this feature will be. Making presentations helps. I took this from marketing.
    Understanding what information should be shown, how you can encourage people to
    listen to you – to listen to your new idea. Basically, make a pitch. It's all
    about marketing – how you make a pitch. For me, it's the same as when I was working
    in B2B marketing – it's how we pitched our product to the B2B users. We just have
    this presentation describing what the benefits of this product are. That’s the
    same thing I do in this company. I explain what the benefits from my product are.
  sec: 3369
  time: '56:09'
  who: Lera
- header: Lera’s resource recommendations
- line: Yeah, thanks. That's a very comprehensive answer. I see that we are almost
    running out of time. I still wanted to ask you one thing. You told us that you
    needed to learn a lot – you took a lot of courses and you read a lot of books.
    We already talked about one book – Relevant Search. Are there any other resources
    that you would recommend to listeners who want to learn more about product ownership
    and this topic?
  sec: 3486
  time: '58:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, it won’t be a typical answer. But I think the crucial take away
    from everything I talked about in this interview – the most crucial skill for
    the product owner is communication. How you build connections and how you talk,
    how good of a manager you are, and how you can encourage people. Basically, I
    would recommend you read books about communication, if you haven't before. Books
    like Dale Carnegie, or about negotiation – some books about… I don't really know
    what it is in English, I read it in another language. It's like, “You Can Negotiate
    Everything,” or something like that. Robert Cialdini – about how to influence.
    All these books are about communication. I also read a book about communication
    called Aikido. A funny one.
  sec: 3516
  time: '58:36'
  who: Lera
- line: So, I think you really need to master your communication skills. That’s the
    first one. There are books related to product ownership – there is a book called
    Professional Product Owner. It's recommended by Scrum. You can go to Scrum.org
    and you will see this book. I read it and it's pretty valuable. It gives you a
    picture of what the product owner is. Also, there's a special book for Scrum –
    to understand the basics of Scrum – Philosophy of Scrum, I think. I think it's
    also good to read this one. What else?
  sec: 3516
  time: '58:36'
  who: Lera
- line: Some books related to your specific topic. For example, I read about search.
    I also remember one book about strategy called Strategize. It’s also very connected
    to product ownership. User Story Mapping also goes to the product ownership basket.
    Also some books related to, for example, e-commerce. It is like a book about experimentation
    and A/B testing. It’s also a very interesting one. I haven't read a book about
    car parts, actually. [laughs]
  sec: 3516
  time: '58:36'
  who: Lera
- line: Not yet, maybe. [chuckles]
  sec: 3694
  time: '1:01:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not yet. [chuckles] We actually have specialists that are more knowledgeable
    in cars – you can grab them into a meeting and they will explain stuff to you.
    I think you can divide some skills you will develop and grab some books for the
    skills, like communication, product management by itself, some books about your
    features (like search) and about e-commerce, and about your business domain. When
    you’re working, it's also fine to have some knowledge.
  sec: 3695
  time: '1:01:35'
  who: Lera
- line: One other tip that you shared with us was learning from everyone – scheduling
    meetings with engineers, QA engineers, business analysts – and just asking them…
    What did you ask? “What do you expect from the product owner? What’s the best
    product owner in the company?” Then, also make some small talk to build a connection
    and, I guess, learn about what they do. I really liked that part. I took a note
    on it.
  sec: 3734
  time: '1:02:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Really cool.'
  sec: 3762
  time: '1:02:42'
  who: Lera
- line: Yeah. I mean, I take a lot of notes. Four sheets here. Anyway, We should be
    wrapping up. Is there anything you want to mention before we finish?
  sec: 3764
  time: '1:02:44'
  who: Alexey
- header: Everything is possible
- line: Yeah. I just want to give some general advice. For me, this is a story about
    how the barriers in your head can be broken. Yeah, I didn't have the same experience
    that I did before but it's possible to learn. It's possible. If you want to change
    your career, if you want to be in a different position, it's possible. You just
    need to break down the barriers in your head. It will be difficult for the first
    half a year. Yes. But if you have this dream, you can do it. It's possible.
  sec: 3775
  time: '1:02:55'
  who: Lera
- line: So the main barrier is in your head. Right? [Lera agrees] Yeah. Okay! Thanks
    a lot! I really enjoyed this interview. It was great. Thanks for coming. Thanks
    for joining us. Thanks for sharing your experience with us. And thanks, everyone,
    for joining and asking questions. It was amazing. Thank you. Have a great week,
