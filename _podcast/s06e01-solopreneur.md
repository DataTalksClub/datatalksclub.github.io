- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: 'Episode Topic & Guest Overview: Becoming a Solopreneur with Noah Gift'
- line: This week, we'll talk about being a solopreneur. I don't know if I pronounced
    it correctly. Like “Entrepreneur” right?
  sec: 74
  time: '1:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Perfect.
  sec: 82
  time: '1:22'
  who: Noah
- line: '[laughs] Yeah. We have a special guest today, Noah. Noah is a founder of
    Pragmatic AI Labs. He lectures at a number of universities... The list of them
    is quite long. How many are there now? 10?'
  sec: 83
  time: '1:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: A lot. Yeah.
  sec: 98
  time: '1:38'
  who: Noah
- line: Noah is a teacher at a number of universities. He also wrote a couple of books.
    Not a couple – more than that – but we will go into that during today's conversation.
    Noah is also a former CTO, individual contributor, and consultant. He has over
    20 years of experience in shipping revenue-generating products in many industries,
    including films, games, and SaaS. I think I also saw your post from LinkedIn when
    you… did you take part in Spider Man?
  sec: 101
  time: '1:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I did. I worked at Sony Pictures Imageworks and we did Spider Man, Superman,
    Chronicles of Narnia. I really love Sony. Sony Imageworks was probably the best
    company I've ever worked at.

- header: 'Early Career: TV, Caltech, Disney and Film Pipeline Experience'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of being a solopreneur, let's start with
    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 157
  time: '2:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: I probably have not a very replicable career, but I'll tell you my background.
    I started, growing up in Southern California, my dad worked in the television
    industry. He had a television production company. So I would go with him when
    I was 10 years old, and actually be the sound person or lighting person, editing.
    I learned a lot of that stuff early on. I actually was eventually an editor for
    ABC network news in Hollywood. So I drove into work and, and edited the news –
    which at 18 was just like crazy. Like, really, really crazy. I was offered a full-time
    job, but I decided to go to college instead. That was kind of a different life.
  sec: 167
  time: '2:47'
  who: Noah
- header: 'Transition to Independent Work: Solopreneur Since 2017'
- line: I was always very interested in sports. I had a period of time where I seriously
    wanted to be either an Olympic athlete or a professional basketball player, or
    a track athlete. I had this whole period of time where I was tempted by it, and
    I studied nutritional science in college. After that, I decided to grow up and
    get a real job. [laughs]
  who: Noah
- line: So then I got a job at CalTech and worked there for a few years. Then I got
    a master's at Cal State LA, so the public school right next door. I would go there
    at night, do classes in information systems – which is kind of similar to data
    science today, I guess. At the time – most people know this – at a university,
    you don't make a ton of money. But it was really cool. I met some really, really
    smart people there that I know even today. But, you know… you want to make more
    money, right? I knew that I had all this experience with TV and I combined all
    the Python and all the stuff I learned in my Master's degree and all the stuff
    I learned at Caltech – and I got a job in live TV.
  who: Noah
- line: I worked in a live TV rental company for a bit. That included things like
    the Big Brother show and those kinds of shows. Then I transitioned to Disney Feature
    Animation and did work there for a while building film pipelines. Then I moved
    to Sony. A lot of the film pipelines – this is something that's pretty rare in
    terms of something people don't know – that, especially in the early 2000s, film
    is probably the most similar thing that exists to data pipelines today. It’s almost
    identical. Centralized file systems, Linux, Python – all this stuff. I hate to
    be the guy that's got the gray beard and says, “We were doing this before!” But,
    we were doing this before. We already did all the data pipeline stuff.
  who: Noah
- line: Then I moved to Atlanta, and was there for a little bit. I worked for Turner
    studios and did some startup stuff. Then I moved to New Zealand for a year and
    worked on the Avatar movie. This also involved film pipelines, high-performance
    computing – one of the biggest supercomputers in the world. I am still in contact
    with many of those people from New Zealand and they've actually moved into very
    similar industries, like ML ops and data engineering. Then I went to the Bay area,
    spent probably about 10 years there, worked at startups and got another Master's
    degree. Then I started teaching after I finished my startup, and then for – probably
    2017 or so – so maybe four years straight, I've been just working for myself through
    a variety of different things.
  who: Noah
- line: Cool. Yeah, that's the first time I hear about “I've done this before.” I
    mean, when it comes to pipelines, this is a totally different perspective – from
    the movie industry. That's pretty interesting. So since 2017, you've been going
    solo, right? You've been a solopreneur since then?
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's right. Yeah.
  sec: 400
  time: '6:40'
  who: Noah
- header: 'Defining Solopreneurship: Intentional Smallness and Revenue Diversification'
- line: What is a solopreneur?
  sec: 402
  time: '6:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: What I would define as a solopreneur – after I had finished working at a startup
    and really putting a lot of energy into it, I was essentially the first non-founding
    person to work at the company and essentially went in and built the company from
    scratch (there were some other people there, of course). It took three years of
    time. I put 100 hour weeks in, we hired all these people, we made money (millions
    of dollars) and all this stuff. And then it just didn't work out. It was a sports
    social network. I just was done. I was like, “Okay, I'm out.” Because I felt like
    I had put everything in it and many people there too – they had really succeeded
    and made money and done all this stuff. So I thought, “Wait, why am I doing this
    for other people?” And also, “Why do I want to ask for permission to be successful?
    Why should I ask some venture capitalists if I can work for their company?” Or
    “Why should I ask my boss, ‘Hey, can I make more money?’ Why don't I just make
    money myself?” So that was the emphasis.
  sec: 404
  time: '6:44'
  who: Noah
- header: 'Small-Business Philosophy: Alternatives to Venture-Backed Growth'
- line: I think solopreneurship is just intentionally being small. It’s not about
    trying to scale something to be really, really big. It’s about building an anti-fragile
    way to make money. Just like with distributed computing and cloud computing, you
    have load balancers, you have machines – you're distributing the load. When you're
    a solopreneur, you should always have (ideally) maybe three of everything. Three
    consulting clients, three different things you're doing in software, three things
    of whatever. Revenue stream, diversify. It gives you leverage. Not necessarily
    leverage so that you can be a bad person and say, “Hey, give me more money.” But
    it gives you leverage in the sense that – if someone's unethical, for example,
    you can say “No.” This is one of the things I was just talking to a friend about,
    even today. One of the nice things about having diversified revenue is, if you
    don't like the ethics of a company, you can say “Bye. Out. Next.” I think that's
    one of the best ways that we could change the world – when people don't need to
    work for a company.
  who: Noah
- line: I could imagine many people, in the Bay area in particular, maybe they have
    a $2 million mortgage. They're working for a company they don't like – they know
    it's bad. They know it's hurting the world and destroying it through misinformation
    or disinformation. But they have no choice, right? Because they have a $2 million
    mortgage. So they have to pretend like, “No, no. We're connecting everybody. It's
    not bad.” You know? Like, “Sure, everybody learns about anti-vax through our platform,
    but…” So you have to kind of trick yourself into this mindset. But if you have
    diverse forms of revenue, you just say “No, I'm not going to work for an ethical
    company.” So to me, that's part of it, too. If you stay small and have distributed
    forms of income, I think you can just live a better life.
  who: Noah
- line: Yeah. I heard about a book called “The Company of One.” I haven't read it
    entirely, but I read a short summary of it. I think the idea there is very similar
    to what you said in the sense that you intentionally want to be small. You don't
    want to be the biggest company in the world – you don't have these ambitions.
    You just want to be small and earn enough to sustain a good lifestyle. That's
    the same idea, right?
  sec: 585
  time: '9:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think it's very similar. I think a lot of people are afraid to say
    what I say because they want to continue to work in tech. I'll say whatever I
    want, because I don't care. If you look, a lot of the VC companies – Paul Graham's
    a good example – they say “billionaires build” etc, etc. It's like, “Well, but
    what are they building?” Oh, they're tricking people into working for less than
    market rates, and then taking common goods (like in the case of those scooters),
    just throwing them on the sidewalks, leaving it for people. No, you’ve made the
    world a worse place by taking something that was free and exploiting it.
  sec: 622
  time: '10:22'
  who: Noah
- line: I'm not against venture capital, I love capitalism. I love it. I love people
    making money and being entrepreneurs. I don't like the exploitative venture capitalists
    who say “We disrupt.” It's like, “No, you steal from people. You steal the commons,
    and you exploit people by lowering their income.” I don't want to do that. So
    to me, that's the opposite of that. It’s saying, “No, I don't want to become a
    billion-dollar company through exploiting humans and exploiting open spaces (like
    congestion from Uber and Lyft in downtown San Francisco). I don't want to take
    over people's sidewalks. I don't want to hurt people. I want to make the world
    a better place.”  I don’t want to take the truth – like Facebook has done – completely
    monopolizing truth, flipping it, turning it into falsehoods, and then monetizing
    that. No, you don't have to do that. I think many people agree – especially post
    COVID-19 – why not just make the world a better place and not work for companies
    that make it a bad place?
  who: Noah
- line: Yeah. Another thing you mentioned was – when you work at a company, you depend
    on somebody to make decisions for you. For example, if you want to get promoted,
    you have to wait until somebody decides to actually give you a raise. But if you
    work for yourself, then you just find another client or something like that. Right?
  sec: 729
  time: '12:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. I think there are a lot of extremely talented people – just
    amazingly talented people – who are stuck in a hierarchical organization, where
    someone that doesn't have as much talent is their boss. The boss's goal is to
    have more power. Then all they do all day is talk to other bosses, and then do
    this and this and this. If someone knows that doing something will be successful,
    they have to ask someone's permission to do something that's obviously correct.
    I think at some point, if you're extremely talented, like so many people that
    I meet, you say, “Well, wait a second. Why would I ask this person to do the right
    thing? Why don't I just do it?” So that's the idea as well. If you know you have
    actual talents or skills – you can make money, you can do things – then hopefully,
    at some point, you ask yourself, “Wait. Why am I asking people to do things? It's
    just slowing me down from making revenue or doing things that I want to do.” So
    I call this, ‘Not asking for permission to be successful.’
  sec: 749
  time: '12:29'
  who: Noah
- header: 'Daily Routine: Exercise, Prioritization, and Task Queues'
- line: Yeah, I'm really wondering – what does your day look like? What do you do,
    usually?
  sec: 821
  time: '13:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: I generally try to exercise every single day. I wake up in the morning, maybe,
    take a walk on the beach, or go rock climbing. I like to do bouldering. Maybe
    lift weights. I find that it's critical to be fit. I'm already pretty fit, but
    I could even be more fit. I feel like that's one of the things that's really,
    really important – to take care of yourself. So, get sleep, wake up, and do some
    exercise. Then after that, I just have a list. I have a list of things I need
    to do. You know, “Hey, I need to write a book chapter.” Or “I need to contact
    this person about this project I'm working on.” It's just a queue of work. The
    queue is sometimes very big and sometimes there's no queue – and I process the
    queue.
  sec: 829
  time: '13:49'
  who: Noah
- line: It's really a prioritization thing. Then I work through that throughout the
    day. Some days, I'll just decide, “Hey. I don't want to do things.” Maybe it's
    a Tuesday, and I think “I was doing a lot of work over the weekend. I'll just
    do nothing. I'll just go sit at the beach.” That's the other thing too. I try
    to be very careful about not biting off more than I can chew because the work
    is infinite, right? The work is infinite if you work for yourself. So you need
    to pace yourself.
  who: Noah
- line: That's interesting. So what kind of things do you have on your list (in your
    queue)? You mentioned writing a chapter – what other kinds of things do you have
    on there?
  sec: 915
  time: '15:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: It'll be whatever is the most important that week. I'll put it on my iPad
    and I'll just have it right next to me. I'll say, “Okay, after I work out or maybe
    even go to the sauna – just really kind of be relaxed, start the day. Okay, what
    do I need to do?” I look at the iPad and I write it down, “Okay, I need to send
    some emails to these people. Okay, there we go. Then I write, “Oh! I need to set
    up this thing that I'm working on for a project. And maybe I need to write some
    code.” I just write a list of maybe five things. Then I go through it as I work
    through the day, and I just cross it off the list. And that's really the gist
    of it. Now if there's something more complex, I wouldn't necessarily put the complexity
    into the to-do list – I'll put it into a spreadsheet instead. I have projects
    that are very complex and may take a year to finish. But I'll work on the project
    and write “Do this part of the project.” So that's really just my board – just
    a very simple iPad list where I cross things out.
  sec: 926
  time: '15:26'
  who: Noah
- header: 'Work Allocation Strategy: Exponential Projects vs. Consulting'
- line: What kind of projects are you working on? Are these clients’ projects? Your
    own projects? Your small businesses?
  sec: 987
  time: '16:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s a whole variety of things. Basically, a lot of what I do – I've done
    different things in different years – but sometimes I'll be doing training. I
    do a lot of work with O'Reilly and a lot of work with other companies as well.
    Teaching things that I know, like ML ops, data engineering, DevOps, Python. I
    do a reasonable amount of those kinds of projects, where you have to say,” Okay,
    here's what I'm gonna build.” I am also working on courses and do a lot of work
    with Coursera. Those take a while. That kind of work could take maybe six months
    – I'm working with a group of people, we meet every week and we do a little bit
    more work. Also, I do some consulting projects. So maybe I'm working with a company
    and building some solutions for them.
  sec: 995
  time: '16:35'
  who: Noah
- line: Then I have other things, like teaching at universities. For that sometimes
    I'll have to build a new course or do some curriculum. When you do work for yourself,
    you have to be careful to focus more of your time on exponential versus logarithmic
    work. In the case of working on something like, in my case, a course or a book,
    or something – that has exponential potential, right? Because many people could
    read it. Or maybe if I put something on YouTube, or on LinkedIn. If it's consulting
    work, that's still good. If I'm learning something, I'm able to apply that later.
    But I try to cap the consulting type of work so that it wouldn't consume more
    than maybe 20% of my available time. I try to do 80% of my work as more of the
    exponential type. I mean, it's not like I'm perfectly doing this. But in general,
    I try to limit and cap and be very, very selective about the consulting work I
    do. Because consulting work is not scalable.
  who: Noah
- line: What I’m wondering, maybe I'm wrong, but this 20% of non-scalable work – is
    this what makes most of the money? Or is it actually the courses and other different
    things?
  sec: 1112
  time: '18:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends. It really depends on what the year is or what it is I'm working
    on. I think of it more like if I were going to spin a distributed computing job.
    Let's say you spun up many processes in Python, for example. Say it’s a multi-processing
    module. You write a function and then you have a bunch of functions that go into
    a process pool. It's non-deterministic, right? It could be maybe this process
    takes a long time and it consumes a lot of CPU. But then you have another process
    that goes [snaps fingers] and finishes really quickly. Then another one's more
    medium. I think that's the way to think about work. If you have some things where
    you don't necessarily need to be thinking about them and they have some form of
    exponential potential, or at least linear or super-linear potential, (like renting
    a property out) that's not bad. I mean, it's not exponential potential, but at
    least maybe linear or super-linear.
  sec: 1126
  time: '18:46'
  who: Noah
- header: 'Long-Term Escape Plan: Incremental Transition Out of Corporate Roles'
- line: Then you also have some things that could maybe take a long time to work out.
    Like if you write a book – who knows? Maybe it's a dud. Maybe it does nothing.
    So I think that's the trick. It’s very, very similar to doing computer science
    distributed computing in the sense that you have to think about things in terms
    of – you're okay with whatever happens because you have lots of different work
    happening in parallel. So it doesn't really matter which one is necessarily a
    big win. The thing that you have to be careful about when doing consulting work
    – it's very tempting to start making a lot of money from a consulting client,
    and then that becomes all you do. Then you're not actually a solopreneur anymore,
    you're working for somebody else. This is called something different.
  who: Noah
- line: When you work for someone else, even as a consultant – even if it's a lot
    of money, let's say half a million dollars a year/a million dollars a year as
    a consultant – then you can't do anything that's exponential. Basically your virtual
    machine, the CPU is at 100%. You can't spin up any more processes on that machine.
    That's all it does. Thus, you don't have the opportunity to profit from some kind
    of exponential work. Again, that’s why I try to limit the consulting. It's good
    because you learn things when you’re consulting. It's really fun. You make contacts.
    I love consulting. At least for me personally – there are people that do consulting
    and that's all they do – but I want to save most of my time for exponential work.
  who: Noah
- line: I also wanted to add – I'm a book author myself, I've written three books.
    Two of them are doing pretty badly. Last quarter, my “Mastering Java for Data
    Science” book sold like 10 copies, probably. It's nice to write a book, but then
    if nobody buys it... I'm not making any money from this book. Another book that
    I have, maybe I have $300 per month from this book, which is also not very impressive.
    What I mean is, if you invest a lot in these exponential things, not necessarily
    all of them will give you an exponential return at the end.
  sec: 1301
  time: '21:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That's a good thing you bring up – there is no silver bullet. So $300
    a month, for example, is probably not going to make many people be able to survive.
    But what if you had ten $300-a-month things? Now, it's interesting. But this,
    I think, is the dilemma of a ‘cold start problem’. It's like you’re building a
    company and you want to get a bunch of users, so you say, “Hey, we have such awesome
    technologies. People would love the thing we built, but no one's here. No one's
    using it.” Yeah. That's the hard part. There's probably no perfect formula for
    doing that. It could take a few years. It could even be that maybe a book does
    nothing. Who cares if the book does nothing? If you're very opportunistic, there
    are other things you could do that are beyond just writing a book.
  sec: 1353
  time: '22:33'
  who: Noah
- header: 'Income Mix Formula: Courses, University Teaching, and Select Consulting'
- line: For example, you could write an application on the iOS store and put it there.
    Who knows? Maybe someone will buy it. But really, I think it's more of a mindset.
    It's a little bit like – if anyone's heard of the movie ‘The Shawshank Redemption,’
    where the lead person in the movie, Tim Robbins, is falsely imprisoned for life
    in a very bad prison and bad things happen to him. But he works for a while. He
    works for a long time and digs his way out with a spoon and escapes. I think the
    thing about escaping from working for unethical corporate companies should remind
    you of the movie ‘The Shawshank Redemption’. You need to build the poster and
    you need to use the spoon and it's gonna take some time.
  who: Noah
- line: You're gonna need to dig that tunnel. But what do you have now? You're free.
    There’s an expression “Freedom isn't free.” If you want to be able to wake up
    every morning, look at the sun, walk at the beach, walk in the park, decide what
    it is you want to work on – it will require sacrifice. And if you don't want to
    be free, just stay in prison. Just stay inside, just like the other character
    that became institutionalized.
  who: Noah
- line: Okay. So to sum up, you're doing courses like Coursera. Then there’s also
    work with universities. You're also doing a lot of training and teaching through
    O'Reilly, about ML ops, data engineering, etc. Then you also do a bit of consulting.
    You try to devote 20% of your time to consulting and the rest would go to your
    teaching activities. Right?
  sec: 1505
  time: '25:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 1531
  time: '25:31'
  who: Noah
- line: Is there anything else?
  sec: 1532
  time: '25:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, there's more. That's the formula. I think anybody can have their own
    formula. There's nothing magical about that particular formula. In fact, you could
    do only consulting. Especially now, if you only do consulting – maybe you have
    three consulting clients – and you could do very well. In fact, I was watching
    a really good show called “Comedians in Cars” and Jay Leno was on it. You can
    learn a lot about solopreneurship by watching that show. Listen very, very carefully.
    Because being a comedian is very similar. They're doing the same thing. They make
    money on shows – that's what I do, right? Like a book or a course. But they also
    do it in person. So they have to do the work, right? They have to teach it and
    learn the material. Jay Leno may also have a kind of a ‘contractor consulting’
    job with his Tonight Show.
  sec: 1533
  time: '25:33'
  who: Noah
- line: He said he always banks one job and works another. So one job he puts in the
    bank. That's the other part of the trick – “Yeah, I have money. I put money in
    the bank – that's investments. I also have other projects that I'm working on
    that pay out. So, real estate, stocks, cash – all those kinds of things. The more
    you have of that, the more chances you can take and the more flexibility you have
    to work on exponential things. I think if you don't have some kind of a reserve

    to rent a house in Marin County, you should probably move [laughs]. Because now
    all of your money is going to pay for your living expenses, but you could potentially
    have very low living expenses and have a lot more flexibility to work on other
    things.

    structure your day?” I think we talked a bit about that. But the other part of
    the question is “How do you set your goals and go about them?” So do you have
    a system for this? Like, “This thing has exponential potential, and this one doesn’t.”
  sec: 1672
  time: '27:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, definitely. Again, this is just for me, and it would be very different
    for other people. I try to focus my time on teaching. One of the reasons I'm teaching
    is (it's not very lucrative – no one makes money, or almost nothing, by teaching.)
    But the reason I do it is (A) it's enjoyable. It makes me happy, because I'm helping
    people. And (B) I'm also learning what people want to know. That's an important
    component. I kind of learn what it is I need to teach people. But in terms of
    choosing my goals, I think exponential potential would be a big one.

    can develop a Coursera course that we could reach 200 million people,” then I
    choose the Coursera because [laughs] there's 200 million people. So definitely,
    the scale is a huge component when choosing goals. But also, as I mentioned before,
    (not to be self-righteous or anything) but I also if I feel like if there's unethical
    technology, I won't do it. I don't have a huge list but Facebook's a good one.
    Anything to do with Facebook, “Nope. Next.” I want to have some capacity of what
    my goals are in terms of “Am I making the world a better place or am I destroying
    it?” I'm fortunate to be in a place where I can choose to not to work on things
    that I feel are destroying the world.
  who: Noah
- line: There’s the ethical component, the exponential component. And then there’s
    “Is there a capacity for me to work on things asynchronously?” Meaning, even if
    someone was going to pay me a lot of money, and they're like, “Yeah, you're going
    to need to show up to a meeting for two hours a day, every single day, for the
    next year.” I'd say “No, sorry. I just don't want to do that. No matter how much
    money you give me.” I mean, there probably would be a limit where I would probably
    say, “Well… Temporarily, I'll do it.” But I just don't want to show up and sit
    in a meeting and do nothing. I also try to focus more on asynchronous work as
    well.

    times, one week, I won’t be as productive. Then some weeks, I'll be really, really
    productive. So I think part of it is just being okay with the fact that you don't
    have to be perfect. The other part of it is, naturally, as you get projects, you
    have to finish them. If you think about most people, they brush their teeth every
    day, and they take a shower – you know, you have no choice. You have to do this,
    right? If you're working on a project, and it's got a deadline – you have to do
    it. There isn't really a lot of wiggle room in terms of this stuff. So that's
    probably one of them, as well.

    I mentioned that not being involved in meetings and BS work, or the people you're

    If someone’s like, “Hey, let's figure out a way to spread even more anti-vaccine
    Information on Facebook, and we're gonna really get grandma to click on this link
    that makes her not take the vaccine.” It's like, “No, I think I'm not gonna do
    that. I'm gonna focus on stuff that makes me happy.” I want to feel like I'm doing
    good work. I think that's a big part of it, if you're able to be really happy
    about what you're working on, the motivation will come.

    there is also a client… I know that maybe for you, it's easier because you've
    written many books. But sometimes, for example, I was struggling a lot with writing,
    because I know that, “Hey, now the publisher is pressuring me, and I really need
    to sit down and write it.” But it's just so difficult for me to sit down and write
    it. Then there is also another project where the client is messaging you saying,
    “Hey, when will it be ready?” And then you also have a course and people are waiting
    for this course. So, yeah. All this stuff.
  sec: 1991
  time: '33:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, yeah. I've had all that. But I think it’s just a perspective, in that
    whenever I think about that, “Oh, I gotta do this course, I gotta do this. I gotta
    do all this stuff.” The way I think about it is, the suffering that I'm undergoing,
    of “Wow, I really feel pressure, etc., etc.” It's actually a reminder of how good
    my life is. The fact that people want me to do work for them and I have all these
    different projects – means I don't have a boss. It's almost like a reminder, “Hey,
    remember? You don't have a boss. You can do anything you want.” “Oh, okay.” Then
    I'm happy. Then it turns into “Oh, I get to work really hard. Yeah, this is great.”
    So I think it's just a way of looking at it. The more pressure you're under when
    you're working for yourself, that's a sign that you're successful.

  sec: 2144
  time: '35:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: In regards to being self-published – I think there are obvious benefits to
    doing it with a publisher. I would say I'd probably prefer to have a combination
    of both. I would say every 18 months or so, I want to try to publish a book with
    a publisher. At least that’s for me, which may be very unusual. For most people,
    they may not even consider that to be good advice. It's a very specialized thing
    to do. But part of it is that, as a consultant, I'm spending all my time trying
    to be at the cutting edge. I like working with publishers like O'Reilly. I really
    like that company. I think they're ethical. I like the founder of O'Reilly. I
    like the president of O'Reilly – I like everyone. They're very, very good people
    to work with. So it's fun for me.
  sec: 2152
  time: '35:52'
  who: Noah
- line: But if I also just happen to be working on something and it makes it easy
    to put it into a book. Yeah. Why not? I think of self-publishing as more of ‘accidental
    products’, where it's like, “Hey, I already have this stuff. Why don't I just
    put it into a book?” Then the publishing stuff is a little more intentional, and
    a little more serious. I think the quality definitely improves, when you have
    really, really talented people like those at O'Reilly for example, working with
    you.
  who: Noah
- line: Also, pressure from the publisher can help, I guess. Because if I didn't have
    a publisher for my last book, I don't think I would have finished it. I would
    have just given up. But since they were constantly writing to me saying, “Hey,
    how is chapter five going?” That would lead me to just sitting down one day and
    finally finishing it.
  sec: 2231
  time: '37:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think it doesn't hurt. I don't know if it's good advice to tell people,
    “Hey, write a bunch of books.” Because as you mentioned, I think it's probably
    a lower probability of generating a lot of income. It's more about the prestige
    when you write a book. But for me – which is in a very specialized, unique area
    that I'm in – I just happen to be spending all my time learning the latest stuff.
    So it's an artifact of what I'm already doing to write books.
  sec: 2256

  who: Noah
- header: 'Book Workflow: Outlines First, Build Projects, Then Write'
- line: The question that we have is also about books. The question is, “How do you
    plan books?” Because it takes a lot of time, right? You have a topic, let's say
    ML ops – like your latest book. This topic is a big thing, so you somehow need
    to chunk it in order to understand which chapters there will be. Then for each
    chapter, you need to put down something concrete. How do you go about doing this?
  sec: 2288
  time: '38:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think that's a good question. Step one, you must do an outline. Must.
    If you don't build an outline, you will not build a book. That's by far the most
    important part. And it's actually pretty easy. If anyone ever wants to write a
    book with you and you want to figure out if they're serious or not, just ask them
    to help build an outline. The people that won’t write anything, won't do the book
    either. So, that's an obvious one. It’s a great way to weed people out.
  sec: 2318
  time: '38:38'
  who: Noah
- line: Once you get the outline, I personally like to build projects first. So, I
    would build some projects for the chapter, maybe put those in GitHub. Then once
    I build the projects, to me, the book writes itself. You just go through and describe
    what you're working on. You say this and this and this. Especially if you're already
    doing that work. Let's say you're working at Twitch, for example, and you're a
    back-end engineer. I just happen to know somebody who works at Twitch. You're
    a back-end engineer, and you're doing a bunch of stuff with HTTP API's and you're
    already doing this documentation for work and you're doing all this stuff. So,
    you already wrote it. It may not be exactly what you’re going to put in the book,
    but you wrote it somewhere already and/or it’s in your mind.
  who: Noah
- line: I think a lot of times people get stuck and they hurt themselves mentally.
    They're like, “Oh, no! It's so stressful.” But it's like “Wait. Don't reinvent
    something.” That’s the other part – “Don't work really hard. Do things you already
    know how to do.” You think that people won't think that it's interesting because
    they're not in your brain. But most people don't know what's in your brain. So
    you just need to take what's in your brain and put it on a piece of paper. I would
    say those are probably the main tips that I would have.
  who: Noah
- line: It sounds easy, but taking something out of your brain and putting this on
    paper takes time. How often do you publish books? Is it every year? I think you
    said it’s every year and a half, right?
  sec: 2425
  time: '40:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Year, or a year and a half. I think for me, the last several years,
    I've definitely done that. At least a book a year. Again, it's more a combination
    of, “It's enjoyable to me to do it” and “I have the time to do it.” That's part
    of my strategy of just forcing myself – It's really like a goal. If you ask someone,
    “Hey, why do you run marathons?” Most people know someone that runs marathons.
    Why do you do it? “Well, it's just something to do.” I trained for the marathon.
    I have a race towards the end of the year. So it’s just kind of a fun thing to
    do to stay in shape – to run a marathon. I think writing a book, if you do become
    someone like me and write a bunch of books, it's just a great way to be relevant
    and stay up to date. Just keep writing books.
  sec: 2437
  time: '40:37'
  who: Noah
- header: 'Writing Discipline: Treating Book Projects Like Marathons'

    time, right? Also it takes practice and skill. And then you actually become better
    at this.
  sec: 2494
  time: '41:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, well it's the same as the analogy. Again, if anyone has ever run a marathon
    – it's not that the marathon is actually difficult. I've run seven. It’s that
    you think it's difficult, but the real issue is that it's self-discipline. You
    just have to get your body used to running for a couple hours. Once you can run
    for a couple hours, you can run a marathon. It's really just the feedback loop
    of “Oh! Yeah, it's actually not that bad. Because a lot of it – running a marathon
    in particular – your mind is telling you “This is bad! Your body hurts so bad!
    No, stop this!” You know, it's tricking you. It's telling you,” Oh, this is awful!”
    But it doesn't hurt. It's not bad. And it's relaxing. You can just run for a couple
    hours and just relax. Same thing with a book. Really, writing a book is not that
    bad. But you think it's bad, so you torture yourself. But actually, you just have
    to do it. You just have to put it onto paper. But the more you do it, the more
    you realize “Yeah, of course it takes some effort.” But it's not as bad as people
    think, the more you do it.

- line: There is a question about distributed income. The question is “Can you give
    some tips on how to get distributed income?” I think we already talked about books,
    which is one piece of the puzzle. Let's say, if you have eight of them, it contributes
    something every month. A little bit, at least. Some books do well, some books
    maybe don't. But overall, eight books together, make something. How do you go
    about the other pieces of the puzzle?
  sec: 2576
  time: '42:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Just any way you can. For example, I do YouTube videos. I make some money
    on that. I published for O’Reilly. I make some money on that. It's basically just
    an accumulation. If you're not in a hurry to make money, then it's much easier
    to make money. I think the way you never make money from distributed income is
    to think like you're a salaried employee. Because when you're a salaried employee,
    it's like, “Ah! I must make $200,000 a year. I can't live in the Bay Area.” But
    that's the wrong way to think for distributed income. What you should be thinking
    is, “How can I make $200,000 a year in 10 pieces?” And it may take five years,
    or it may take three years to do it.
  sec: 2611
  time: '43:31'
  who: Noah
- header: 'Side-Gig Strategy: Building the “Tunnel” While Employed'
- line: It's even better if the sources are not related. Maybe a book is a little
    bit. Let's say you need to make $10,000 a month – maybe 1000 bucks comes in from
    books. But what else could you do? You could also build an app. Maybe the app
    gets lucky. Maybe it does 2000 a month. Now you're at 3000. It's like points on
    the board in a basketball game. Okay, what's next? Well, maybe you could buy a
    duplex. So you do a little consulting first and you build up a lot of money. You
    buy a duplex, you rent out one side. Now you have another 2000. Now you're up
    to 5000. Then eventually, you add up the pieces and they're all different and
    they're unrelated. Say the real estate market all of a sudden goes “Oh! It's horrible!”
    Who cares? You have the other money. Likewise, nobody buys your books – who cares?
    You have the real estate money. That's kind of the idea – to be patient and to
    think about it. It may take a while to build up all the things. But also, I think
    it's much, much better to not go all in on just one thing because anything can
    happen to it.
  who: Noah
- line: Part of it, again, is probably lowering your expenses by moving somewhere
    cheap. Also saving, if possible, a bunch of income. If you are working at FANG
    company or something like that. If you could move, bank the majority of your money,
    and then you have a pool of cash – way easier to do all kinds of distributed income.
    In California, they have all these droughts. But if you think about it, how does
    the whole water system work? You have a lake. Inside the lake, it’s full of water.
    There's water coming out and there's water coming into the lake, right? So you
    need a lot of water in the lake if the water's coming out. You need to put lots
    of streams that feed into the lake. I think that's another analogy – the bigger
    your lake is, the more time you have to find other streams to put into the lake.
    The smaller the lake is, the more chances you have to take and potentially get
    yourself in trouble. So it’s helpful to have a pool of money while you're getting
    started.
  who: Noah

    being a full-time employee?
  sec: 2787

    thing, if we go back to that movie, The Shawshank Redemption. Can you escape prison
    without digging a tunnel? Yeah, you can. But what if you get caught? It can be
    very risky, right? But what he did was – which I think was the right strategy
    – he took his time. He still pretended like he was happy. Every day, he was friendly
    with the warden of the prison. So, be happy with your boss. Meanwhile, you're
    slowly digging through the tunnel with a spoon. Every day you take it out to the
    yard and drop it off into the dirt. But there's no rush.

    book, course, consulting gig or?
  sec: 2841
  time: '47:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: All those things. Books, consulting, etc. Again, I think that's why having
    low expenses and a lot of money in the bank – the more money the better – you
    can basically start to put streams into the lake. Here's another example. If you
    have enough money in the bank, you could buy a stock that gives you dividends.
    You're done. Right? You could get 5% from it in dividends per year. So there are
    a lot of little streams that you can put into it. But I think from a risk/reward
    perspective, why blow yourself up and quit your job and all this stuff? If you
    have lots of expenses, it's much better to slowly build stuff.

    Maybe do a little bit on the side – have a side gig. Maybe build an app, maybe
    build a book, maybe do rental property. Again, the more different it is in what
    you do (in some sense), the better. If you have money in investments, like index
    funds or something, and then you have money in stocks, and then you also have
    some consulting projects – and all that’s happening while you're working full
    time at a company. Then you also have a good reserve and low expenses, you have
    a lot more flexibility to try things out. I think it's not necessarily an ‘either/or’
    situation where you have to say, “Hey, I want to work for myself. So, I'm going
    to just go all in and live off a credit card.” I think that's actually a very
    bad idea.
  who: Noah
- line: Let's say you already work 40 hours per week or maybe 50-60 hours per week
    at the company (for somebody). How do you find the time to actually do all these
    things you mentioned? Well, I guess one thing is, if you have money, you can invest
    it. What if you don't have money?
  sec: 2952
  time: '49:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, let's tackle this one point at a time. The first one is “What would
    you do if your company makes you work a lot of hours?” One is just to work less.
    Work 40 hours a week. What are they gonna do, fire you? Say, “No, I will work
    40 hours a week. That's it.” That's one possibility. If that's not an option,
    hopefully, you're able to just quit and get a job where you can work 40 hours
    a week. Then the problem solves itself. I think sometimes a simple solution is
    obvious. I also think startups in general are a very bad bet for most people.
    If you're financially independent, maybe a startup is okay. But if you're not
    financially independent and you live paycheck to paycheck, why work at a startup?
    Why not just work somewhere that you don't have to work 60 hours a week – go somewhere
    where you work 40, and now you have 20 hours a week to spend on yourself. So I
    think that's a big part of it.
  sec: 2977
  time: '49:37'
  who: Noah
- line: Another one is – get rid of the commute. Go somewhere where you can work remotely.
    A commute could be two hours a day. I think you can definitely figure out a way
    to work less at your job. Also, just be better at it, especially if you're remote.
    I think most software engineers could probably work four hours a day and be totally
    fine. Then you have the rest of the day to do whatever you need to do. As long
    as you're really efficient, zoned in, you're caffeinated, you're ready to go and
    just get your work done. That's one part of it.
  who: Noah
- line: The second one, if you don't have any money, I would say it's pretty simple
    – profit and loss. Right? If you don't have a lot of money, in my opinion – get
    out of somewhere expensive, immediately. Go to the cheapest place you can. It's
    a goal. Delete your expenses to 25%. Now that you have low expenses, now you have
    money. Start putting that money into the bank and save it. That's the easiest
    possible way to do it. Then start building more projects.
  who: Noah
- line: But imagine, let's say you work in the Bay Area and you have to live there.
    If you go to some other place, the salaries you have there are lower. I guess
    now with the remote work thing, it's better. But still. In the Bay Area, you get
    more money, but you have to pay more to live there.

    can move. But let's take the experimental argument at face value. I would say,
    “Okay, then move to a bad part of the Bay Area that's cheap.” Right? [laughs]
    And move into a smaller house and take another job where you have to work less.
    Because again, are you betting on yourself or are you betting on other people?
    To me, I think many talented people should bet on themselves, not their company.
    Not that I have anything wrong with companies.

- line: Although I will say that, I think we're at a weird period of time. Look at
    the just insane CEO to employee ratio. I don't know what the CEO of Google makes,
    but it's completely ridiculous. Why should the CEO of Google make 1000 times what
    an employee makes? The contract is broken. Now, if the company's made things more
    reasonable, like 50 times more – or if they had a little bit more of a reasonable
    way that they compensated people’s salaries, I think it'd be different. Then I
    would say, “Okay, maybe you should work at a company for a little bit longer.”
    But I personally think it's broken. So why would you bet on this company? They're
    paying the CEO 1000 times what they're paying you. They don't care about you.
    Why don't you just bet on yourself?
  who: Noah
- line: Yeah, it's gonna take a while and you're gonna have to juggle things around,
    but do you have an option? It's like the guy, again, in Shawshank Redemption.
    “Hey, I don't like it that I'm in prison.” Well, you're in prison. You can't magically…
    aliens can't come from outer space and transport you to a new planet. You're in
    prison. What are you gonna do about it? What he did about it was dig his way out.
    It's gonna take some stuff to do, but you can do it – if you're motivated and
    you're patient.
  who: Noah
- line: Let's get back to this person who wants to get out of the full-time job and
    start being a solopreneur. You said “Put money in the bank and start investing.”
    Then you can work on courses, on books, and you also mentioned that you can start
    getting consultant gigs. Once you have these things, when is the right time? How
    do you know it's time to quit? When you have enough money? Or when?
  sec: 3229
  time: '53:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think that's a good way to do it. If you have enough money where you
    feel like you're not putting yourself into financial Jeopardy, then I think that's
    a good time to quit your job. Because now there’s a balancing act, where once
    you know you have the ability to make money, then the more time you spend at a
    company, you're losing your own money, right? That's one where it's obvious. It's
    like, “Wait a second! I'm making way more money on the stuff I'm doing on the
    side than I'm doing at my company. And I don't like my company. And, it's just
    not exciting. Why am I here?” That would be the obvious time to quit.

- line: Do you think building a network is important for being a solopreneur?
  sec: 3306
  time: '55:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think it's very important. I think you need to be able to have trusted
    people that you work with. That's one of the benefits of having a career – you
    get to know people. You know who's good, who's bad. You build a network. So I
    think while you are working at a company, my recommendation would be – and this
    is probably non-conventional – I would say, “Do not be a middle manager.” Especially
    for solopreneurship, avoid any form of management at all because you're deleting
    your value.
  sec: 3311
  time: '55:11'
  who: Noah
- line: If you're able to focus on your skills, get to be as good as possible at your
    company. Be so good at your company that people are just terrified if you left
    because of how competent you are, and how good you are, and reliable you are.
    That helps build your network and then also helps build your skills. A good example
    would be comedians, if we go back to them. I think they're so fascinating to look
    at for technical people. A person that's booking a famous comedian like Jerry
    Seinfeld – who cares about that person? Nobody cares about the manager. Nobody
    cares. They want to see Jerry Seinfeld do a comedy special. Right?
  who: Noah
- line: So it’s the same thing, if you think that the extra $10,000 a year or $20,000
    a year that you make as a manager does anything, you're mistaken. Because you're
    deleting your value by doing that. If Jerry Seinfeld started managing other comedians,
    instead of improving his comedy, no one would care about what he does. That I
    think is also really critical as you're moving forward. Impress people and get
    very good at what you do so that you're extremely valuable.
  who: Noah
- line: What may happen as well is that the opportunity may present itself in the
    company. Maybe another person wants to do some kind of side project and hire you
    to work on it. They're like, “Wow, you're the smartest person in the company at
    this.” Because you're just so impressive, they give you a consulting job. So it
    may just come to you.
  who: Noah
- line: Basically, the best tip for building a network is “Be good at things.” “Do
    not go into middle management.” and “Just talk to people around you.” Right?
  sec: 3434
  time: '57:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Noah
- line: And I guess “Be visible.” If you're good at something, you should also tell
    people about that. Otherwise, they will not find out about you.
  sec: 3443
  time: '57:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Well, that's why writing the book is helpful, right? Just be so good
    that people know who you are. Maybe that's why you write the book. But also, when
    you're at your work as well – because remember, if your mission is to escape the
    prison – avoid anything that is counterproductive to that goal. For example, engaging
    in useless meetings, office water cooler chatter, company retreats, etc. Anything
    that's optional, just delete it. Get better. Just get better. Improve yourself.
    You're doing something different. Everyone else is still walking around the prison.
    You’ve got to go back to your cell and open up that poster so you can just keep
    digging through. Because you’ve got to get out.

- line: Yeah. I see that we should be wrapping up. But I have one question that I
    wanted to ask you. “How did you get into university and start teaching there?”
    Let's say somebody wants to do that. For example, I want to go to university and
    start teaching while still working. I don't know how it happened with you. How
    can people do this?
  sec: 3504
  time: '58:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think that's a great question. Part of it is exactly the advice I
    just said – be good at what you do. Then people will reach out to you. If you're
    really, really good at a subject and you stay in touch with your professors –
    you’re networking and you write a book on it. In my case, my professor just came
    to me, like “Hey! You teach machine learning. Can you teach this class?” There
    you go. And you just teach a class. So I think just be very good, network with
    your professors, write a book, and it's very likely that someone may come to you.
    That's an easy way to teach at a university.

    for many things, yeah.
  sec: 3563

    network even more. Because students know you and you get this exponential effect.
