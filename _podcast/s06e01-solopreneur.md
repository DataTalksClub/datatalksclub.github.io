    \ books. Not a couple \u2013 more than that \u2013 but we will go into that during\
    \ today's conversation. Noah is also a former CTO, individual contributor, and\
    \ consultant. He has over 20 years of experience in shipping revenue-generating\
    \ products in many industries, including films, games, and SaaS. I think I also\
    \ saw your post from LinkedIn when you\u2026 did you take part in Spider Man?"
  sec: 101

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I did. I worked at Sony Pictures Imageworks and we did Spider Man, Superman,
    Chronicles of Narnia. I really love Sony. Sony Imageworks was probably the best
    company I've ever worked at.

- line: Before we go into our main topic of being a solopreneur, let's start with
    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 157
  time: '2:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I probably have not a very replicable career, but I'll tell you my background.\
    \ I started, growing up in Southern California, my dad worked in the television\
    \ industry. He had a television production company. So I would go with him when\
    \ I was 10 years old, and actually be the sound person or lighting person, editing.\
    \ I learned a lot of that stuff early on. I actually was eventually an editor\
    \ for ABC network news in Hollywood. So I drove into work and, and edited the\
    \ news \u2013 which at 18 was just like crazy. Like, really, really crazy. I was\
    \ offered a full-time job, but I decided to go to college instead. That was kind\
    \ of a different life."
  sec: 167
  time: '2:47'
  who: Noah
- line: I was always very interested in sports. I had a period of time where I seriously
    wanted to be either an Olympic athlete or a professional basketball player, or
    a track athlete. I had this whole period of time where I was tempted by it, and
    I studied nutritional science in college. After that, I decided to grow up and
    get a real job. [laughs]
  who: Noah
- line: "So then I got a job at CalTech and worked there for a few years. Then I got\
    \ a master's at Cal State LA, so the public school right next door. I would go\
    \ there at night, do classes in information systems \u2013 which is kind of similar\
    \ to data science today, I guess. At the time \u2013 most people know this \u2013\
    \ at a university, you don't make a ton of money. But it was really cool. I met\
    \ some really, really smart people there that I know even today. But, you know\u2026\
    \ you want to make more money, right? I knew that I had all this experience with\
    \ TV and I combined all the Python and all the stuff I learned in my Master's\
    \ degree and all the stuff I learned at Caltech \u2013 and I got a job in live\
    \ TV."
  who: Noah
- line: "I worked in a live TV rental company for a bit. That included things like\
    \ the Big Brother show and those kinds of shows. Then I transitioned to Disney\
    \ Feature Animation and did work there for a while building film pipelines. Then\
    \ I moved to Sony. A lot of the film pipelines \u2013 this is something that's\
    \ pretty rare in terms of something people don't know \u2013 that, especially\
    \ in the early 2000s, film is probably the most similar thing that exists to data\
    \ pipelines today. It\u2019s almost identical. Centralized file systems, Linux,\
    \ Python \u2013 all this stuff. I hate to be the guy that's got the gray beard\
    \ and says, \u201CWe were doing this before!\u201D But, we were doing this before.\
    \ We already did all the data pipeline stuff."
  who: Noah
- line: "Then I moved to Atlanta, and was there for a little bit. I worked for Turner\
    \ studios and did some startup stuff. Then I moved to New Zealand for a year and\
    \ worked on the Avatar movie. This also involved film pipelines, high-performance\
    \ computing \u2013 one of the biggest supercomputers in the world. I am still\
    \ in contact with many of those people from New Zealand and they've actually moved\
    \ into very similar industries, like ML ops and data engineering. Then I went\
    \ to the Bay area, spent probably about 10 years there, worked at startups and\
    \ got another Master's degree. Then I started teaching after I finished my startup,\
    \ and then for \u2013 probably 2017 or so \u2013 so maybe four years straight,\
    \ I've been just working for myself through a variety of different things."
  who: Noah
- line: "Cool. Yeah, that's the first time I hear about \u201CI've done this before.\u201D\
    \ I mean, when it comes to pipelines, this is a totally different perspective\
    \ \u2013 from the movie industry. That's pretty interesting. So since 2017, you've\
    \ been going solo, right? You've been a solopreneur since then?"

- line: What is a solopreneur?
  sec: 402
  time: '6:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "What I would define as a solopreneur \u2013 after I had finished working\
    \ at a startup and really putting a lot of energy into it, I was essentially the\
    \ first non-founding person to work at the company and essentially went in and\
    \ built the company from scratch (there were some other people there, of course).\
    \ It took three years of time. I put 100 hour weeks in, we hired all these people,\
    \ we made money (millions of dollars) and all this stuff. And then it just didn't\
    \ work out. It was a sports social network. I just was done. I was like, \u201C\
    Okay, I'm out.\u201D Because I felt like I had put everything in it and many people\
    \ there too \u2013 they had really succeeded and made money and done all this\
    \ stuff. So I thought, \u201CWait, why am I doing this for other people?\u201D\
    \ And also, \u201CWhy do I want to ask for permission to be successful? Why should\
    \ I ask some venture capitalists if I can work for their company?\u201D Or \u201C\
    Why should I ask my boss, \u2018Hey, can I make more money?\u2019 Why don't I\
    \ just make money myself?\u201D So that was the emphasis."
  sec: 404
  time: '6:44'
  who: Noah
- line: "I think solopreneurship is just intentionally being small. It\u2019s not\
    \ about trying to scale something to be really, really big. It\u2019s about building\
    \ an anti-fragile way to make money. Just like with distributed computing and\
    \ cloud computing, you have load balancers, you have machines \u2013 you're distributing\
    \ the load. When you're a solopreneur, you should always have (ideally) maybe\
    \ three of everything. Three consulting clients, three different things you're\
    \ doing in software, three things of whatever. Revenue stream, diversify. It gives\
    \ you leverage. Not necessarily leverage so that you can be a bad person and say,\
    \ \u201CHey, give me more money.\u201D But it gives you leverage in the sense\
    \ that \u2013 if someone's unethical, for example, you can say \u201CNo.\u201D\
    \ This is one of the things I was just talking to a friend about, even today.\
    \ One of the nice things about having diversified revenue is, if you don't like\
    \ the ethics of a company, you can say \u201CBye. Out. Next.\u201D I think that's\
    \ one of the best ways that we could change the world \u2013 when people don't\
    \ need to work for a company."
  who: Noah
- line: "I could imagine many people, in the Bay area in particular, maybe they have\
    \ a $2 million mortgage. They're working for a company they don't like \u2013\
    \ they know it's bad. They know it's hurting the world and destroying it through\
    \ misinformation or disinformation. But they have no choice, right? Because they\
    \ have a $2 million mortgage. So they have to pretend like, \u201CNo, no. We're\
    \ connecting everybody. It's not bad.\u201D You know? Like, \u201CSure, everybody\
    \ learns about anti-vax through our platform, but\u2026\u201D So you have to kind\
    \ of trick yourself into this mindset. But if you have diverse forms of revenue,\
    \ you just say \u201CNo, I'm not going to work for an ethical company.\u201D So\
    \ to me, that's part of it, too. If you stay small and have distributed forms\
    \ of income, I think you can just live a better life."
  who: Noah
- header: Company of One
- line: "Yeah. I heard about a book called \u201CThe Company of One.\u201D I haven't\
    \ read it entirely, but I read a short summary of it. I think the idea there is\
    \ very similar to what you said in the sense that you intentionally want to be\
    \ small. You don't want to be the biggest company in the world \u2013 you don't\
    \ have these ambitions. You just want to be small and earn enough to sustain a\
    \ good lifestyle. That's the same idea, right?"
  sec: 585
  time: '9:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, I think it's very similar. I think a lot of people are afraid to say\
    \ what I say because they want to continue to work in tech. I'll say whatever\
    \ I want, because I don't care. If you look, a lot of the VC companies \u2013\
    \ Paul Graham's a good example \u2013 they say \u201Cbillionaires build\u201D\
    \ etc, etc. It's like, \u201CWell, but what are they building?\u201D Oh, they're\
    \ tricking people into working for less than market rates, and then taking common\
    \ goods (like in the case of those scooters), just throwing them on the sidewalks,\
    \ leaving it for people. No, you\u2019ve made the world a worse place by taking\
    \ something that was free and exploiting it."
  sec: 622
  time: '10:22'
  who: Noah
- line: "I'm not against venture capital, I love capitalism. I love it. I love people\
    \ making money and being entrepreneurs. I don't like the exploitative venture\
    \ capitalists who say \u201CWe disrupt.\u201D It's like, \u201CNo, you steal from\
    \ people. You steal the commons, and you exploit people by lowering their income.\u201D\
    \ I don't want to do that. So to me, that's the opposite of that. It\u2019s saying,\
    \ \u201CNo, I don't want to become a billion-dollar company through exploiting\
    \ humans and exploiting open spaces (like congestion from Uber and Lyft in downtown\
    \ San Francisco). I don't want to take over people's sidewalks. I don't want to\
    \ hurt people. I want to make the world a better place.\u201D  I don\u2019t want\
    \ to take the truth \u2013 like Facebook has done \u2013 completely monopolizing\
    \ truth, flipping it, turning it into falsehoods, and then monetizing that. No,\
    \ you don't have to do that. I think many people agree \u2013 especially post\
    \ COVID-19 \u2013 why not just make the world a better place and not work for\
    \ companies that make it a bad place?"
  who: Noah
- line: "Yeah. Another thing you mentioned was \u2013 when you work at a company,\
    \ you depend on somebody to make decisions for you. For example, if you want to\
    \ get promoted, you have to wait until somebody decides to actually give you a\
    \ raise. But if you work for yourself, then you just find another client or something\
    \ like that. Right?"
  sec: 729
  time: '12:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, exactly. I think there are a lot of extremely talented people \u2013\
    \ just amazingly talented people \u2013 who are stuck in a hierarchical organization,\
    \ where someone that doesn't have as much talent is their boss. The boss's goal\
    \ is to have more power. Then all they do all day is talk to other bosses, and\
    \ then do this and this and this. If someone knows that doing something will be\
    \ successful, they have to ask someone's permission to do something that's obviously\
    \ correct. I think at some point, if you're extremely talented, like so many people\
    \ that I meet, you say, \u201CWell, wait a second. Why would I ask this person\
    \ to do the right thing? Why don't I just do it?\u201D So that's the idea as well.\
    \ If you know you have actual talents or skills \u2013 you can make money, you\
    \ can do things \u2013 then hopefully, at some point, you ask yourself, \u201C\
    Wait. Why am I asking people to do things? It's just slowing me down from making\
    \ revenue or doing things that I want to do.\u201D So I call this, \u2018Not asking\
    \ for permission to be successful.\u2019"

    \ do, usually?"
  sec: 821
  time: '13:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I generally try to exercise every single day. I wake up in the morning, maybe,\
    \ take a walk on the beach, or go rock climbing. I like to do bouldering. Maybe\
    \ lift weights. I find that it's critical to be fit. I'm already pretty fit, but\
    \ I could even be more fit. I feel like that's one of the things that's really,\
    \ really important \u2013 to take care of yourself. So, get sleep, wake up, and\
    \ do some exercise. Then after that, I just have a list. I have a list of things\
    \ I need to do. You know, \u201CHey, I need to write a book chapter.\u201D Or\
    \ \u201CI need to contact this person about this project I'm working on.\u201D\
    \ It's just a queue of work. The queue is sometimes very big and sometimes there's\
    \ no queue \u2013 and I process the queue."
  sec: 829
  time: '13:49'
  who: Noah
- line: "It's really a prioritization thing. Then I work through that throughout the\
    \ day. Some days, I'll just decide, \u201CHey. I don't want to do things.\u201D\
    \ Maybe it's a Tuesday, and I think \u201CI was doing a lot of work over the weekend.\
    \ I'll just do nothing. I'll just go sit at the beach.\u201D That's the other\
    \ thing too. I try to be very careful about not biting off more than I can chew\
    \ because the work is infinite, right? The work is infinite if you work for yourself.\
    \ So you need to pace yourself."
  who: Noah
- line: "That's interesting. So what kind of things do you have on your list (in your\
    \ queue)? You mentioned writing a chapter \u2013 what other kinds of things do\
    \ you have on there?"

    \ and I'll just have it right next to me. I'll say, \u201COkay, after I work out\
    \ or maybe even go to the sauna \u2013 just really kind of be relaxed, start the\
    \ day. Okay, what do I need to do?\u201D I look at the iPad and I write it down,\
    \ \u201COkay, I need to send some emails to these people. Okay, there we go. Then\
    \ I write, \u201COh! I need to set up this thing that I'm working on for a project.\
    \ And maybe I need to write some code.\u201D I just write a list of maybe five\
    \ things. Then I go through it as I work through the day, and I just cross it\
    \ off the list. And that's really the gist of it. Now if there's something more\
    \ complex, I wouldn't necessarily put the complexity into the to-do list \u2013\
    \ I'll put it into a spreadsheet instead. I have projects that are very complex\
    \ and may take a year to finish. But I'll work on the project and write \u201C\
    Do this part of the project.\u201D So that's really just my board \u2013 just\
    \ a very simple iPad list where I cross things out."

    \ training. I do a lot of work with O'Reilly and a lot of work with other companies\
    \ as well. Teaching things that I know, like ML ops, data engineering, DevOps,\
    \ Python. I do a reasonable amount of those kinds of projects, where you have\
    \ to say,\u201D Okay, here's what I'm gonna build.\u201D I am also working on\
    \ courses and do a lot of work with Coursera. Those take a while. That kind of\
    \ work could take maybe six months \u2013 I'm working with a group of people,\
    \ we meet every week and we do a little bit more work. Also, I do some consulting\
    \ projects. So maybe I'm working with a company and building some solutions for\
    \ them."

  time: '16:35'
  who: Noah
- line: "Then I have other things, like teaching at universities. For that sometimes\
    \ I'll have to build a new course or do some curriculum. When you do work for\
    \ yourself, you have to be careful to focus more of your time on exponential versus\
    \ logarithmic work. In the case of working on something like, in my case, a course\
    \ or a book, or something \u2013 that has exponential potential, right? Because\
    \ many people could read it. Or maybe if I put something on YouTube, or on LinkedIn.\
    \ If it's consulting work, that's still good. If I'm learning something, I'm able\
    \ to apply that later. But I try to cap the consulting type of work so that it\
    \ wouldn't consume more than maybe 20% of my available time. I try to do 80% of\
    \ my work as more of the exponential type. I mean, it's not like I'm perfectly\
    \ doing this. But in general, I try to limit and cap and be very, very selective\
    \ about the consulting work I do. Because consulting work is not scalable."
  who: Noah
- line: "What I\u2019m wondering, maybe I'm wrong, but this 20% of non-scalable work\
    \ \u2013 is this what makes most of the money? Or is it actually the courses and\
    \ other different things?"
  sec: 1112
  time: '18:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It depends. It really depends on what the year is or what it is I'm working\
    \ on. I think of it more like if I were going to spin a distributed computing\
    \ job. Let's say you spun up many processes in Python, for example. Say it\u2019\
    s a multi-processing module. You write a function and then you have a bunch of\
    \ functions that go into a process pool. It's non-deterministic, right? It could\
    \ be maybe this process takes a long time and it consumes a lot of CPU. But then\
    \ you have another process that goes [snaps fingers] and finishes really quickly.\
    \ Then another one's more medium. I think that's the way to think about work.\
    \ If you have some things where you don't necessarily need to be thinking about\
    \ them and they have some form of exponential potential, or at least linear or\
    \ super-linear potential, (like renting a property out) that's not bad. I mean,\
    \ it's not exponential potential, but at least maybe linear or super-linear."
  sec: 1126
  time: '18:46'
  who: Noah
- line: "Then you also have some things that could maybe take a long time to work\
    \ out. Like if you write a book \u2013 who knows? Maybe it's a dud. Maybe it does\
    \ nothing. So I think that's the trick. It\u2019s very, very similar to doing\
    \ computer science distributed computing in the sense that you have to think about\
    \ things in terms of \u2013 you're okay with whatever happens because you have\
    \ lots of different work happening in parallel. So it doesn't really matter which\
    \ one is necessarily a big win. The thing that you have to be careful about when\
    \ doing consulting work \u2013 it's very tempting to start making a lot of money\
    \ from a consulting client, and then that becomes all you do. Then you're not\
    \ actually a solopreneur anymore, you're working for somebody else. This is called\
    \ something different."
  who: Noah
- line: "When you work for someone else, even as a consultant \u2013 even if it's\
    \ a lot of money, let's say half a million dollars a year/a million dollars a\
    \ year as a consultant \u2013 then you can't do anything that's exponential. Basically\
    \ your virtual machine, the CPU is at 100%. You can't spin up any more processes\
    \ on that machine. That's all it does. Thus, you don't have the opportunity to\
    \ profit from some kind of exponential work. Again, that\u2019s why I try to limit\
    \ the consulting. It's good because you learn things when you\u2019re consulting.\
    \ It's really fun. You make contacts. I love consulting. At least for me personally\
    \ \u2013 there are people that do consulting and that's all they do \u2013 but\
    \ I want to save most of my time for exponential work."

    \ Java for Data Science\u201D book sold like 10 copies, probably. It's nice to\
    \ write a book, but then if nobody buys it... I'm not making any money from this\
    \ book. Another book that I have, maybe I have $300 per month from this book,\
    \ which is also not very impressive. What I mean is, if you invest a lot in these\
    \ exponential things, not necessarily all of them will give you an exponential\
    \ return at the end."

  time: '21:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. That's a good thing you bring up \u2013 there is no silver bullet.\
    \ So $300 a month, for example, is probably not going to make many people be able\
    \ to survive. But what if you had ten $300-a-month things? Now, it's interesting.\
    \ But this, I think, is the dilemma of a \u2018cold start problem\u2019. It's\
    \ like you\u2019re building a company and you want to get a bunch of users, so\
    \ you say, \u201CHey, we have such awesome technologies. People would love the\
    \ thing we built, but no one's here. No one's using it.\u201D Yeah. That's the\
    \ hard part. There's probably no perfect formula for doing that. It could take\

    \ Now you're up to 5000. Then eventually, you add up the pieces and they're all\
    \ different and they're unrelated. Say the real estate market all of a sudden\
    \ goes \u201COh! It's horrible!\u201D Who cares? You have the other money. Likewise,\
    \ nobody buys your books \u2013 who cares? You have the real estate money. That's\
    \ kind of the idea \u2013 to be patient and to think about it. It may take a while\
    \ to build up all the things. But also, I think it's much, much better to not\
    \ go all in on just one thing because anything can happen to it."

    \ money, and then you have a pool of cash \u2013 way easier to do all kinds of\
    \ distributed income. In California, they have all these droughts. But if you\
    \ think about it, how does the whole water system work? You have a lake. Inside\
    \ the lake, it\u2019s full of water. There's water coming out and there's water\
    \ coming into the lake, right? So you need a lot of water in the lake if the water's\
    \ coming out. You need to put lots of streams that feed into the lake. I think\
    \ that's another analogy \u2013 the bigger your lake is, the more time you have\
    \ to find other streams to put into the lake. The smaller the lake is, the more\
    \ chances you have to take and potentially get yourself in trouble. So it\u2019\
    s helpful to have a pool of money while you're getting started."
