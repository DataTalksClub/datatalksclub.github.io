- header: Intro
- line: Today we have pleasure to have Dat as a guest. Dat needs no introduction.
    If you have a LinkedIn account, you probably already know him. If you don't have
    a LinkedIn account, Dat has a lot of experience in building data teams, and this
    will be the topic today. So he led a team at Idealo. This is a popular price comparison
    tool in Germany. Then he was a head of AI at Axel Springer. This is a big publication
    house. And now he is the CTO and co-founder of Priceloop. So thank you Dat for
    coming to the show today.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, thanks for having me, Alexey
  sec: 173
  time: '2:53'
  who: Dat
- header: "Dat\u2019s early career"
- line: Yes, we'll start with your background. So can you please tell us how you started
    your career? How did you get into machine learning? And how this all led to becoming
    a CTO of your own startup?
  sec: 177
  time: '2:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, sure. I would say, my career is not very straightforward. I didn't study\
    \ computer science which would probably naturally grow into the area of machine\
    \ learning. I actually studied business \u2014 I studied economics at Humboldt\
    \ University and I was more into investment banking."
  sec: 192
  time: '3:12'
  who: Dat
- line: But since I was a child, I was a lot into gaming, and due to gaming, I also
    got into coding. I started to do coding very early. I think I was 12 or 13, I'd
    create my first HTML websites. I did my own forum and other stuff, and then over
    the time, I got into more of these areas and then I learned to program as well.
  sec: 222
  time: '3:42'
  who: Dat
- line: "While I was in investment banking, I solved a lot of problems with coding\
    \ and programming. It's like monkey business: you have to copy paste, you sit\
    \ into 2 or 3am. And you copy and paste things. Where I just wrote a simple VBA\
    \ script on Excel, which solved my problem within two minutes where my peers were\
    \ working for three to four hours. And I was thinking, \u201COkay, maybe I should\
    \ do something with software engineering,\u201D"
  sec: 263
  time: '4:23'
  who: Dat
- line: "It was well paid, but it's really a monkey business. Then I went back to\
    \ my graduate studies I majored in, in operation research and econometrics. Then\
    \ a friend of mine, he was studying statistics in Munich. And he told me, \u201C\
    Hey, well, there\u2019s this cool course \u2013 machine learning. You should do\
    \ it\u201D. I think a lot of people did that course at that time."
  sec: 297
  time: '4:57'
  who: Dat
- line: "I think it was six years ago, something \u2013 six or seven years ago, I\
    \ did that course that was like, \u201COh, yeah, that sounds interesting what\
    \ he's doing.\u201D And a lot of the stuff that he said in the course, is something\
    \ that I already did at university, but it was presented differently. Because\
    \ now he called supervised learning for linear regression problems. So I was like,\
    \ \u201COkay, so I know some of this stuff.\u201D And now I have a little bit\
    \ of machine learning context, but also \u2013 how you would actually apply it\
    \ in the real world \u2014 for the business world. Because while you're studying\
    \ just the concepts, you learn theorems. And you don't know how to use it in real\
    \ life."
  sec: 328
  time: '5:28'
  who: Dat
- line: "At the end, I had to decide, \u201COkay, where do I want to go?\u201D Should\
    \ I do a PhD or go to the industry? Luckily, at the time, Accenture was having\
    \ a new team called Advanced Analytics. Then I decided, \u201COkay, I should apply\
    \ there, because it's a new team\u201D. There I was not doing a lot of data science\
    \ or something like that. It was simple statistics, but six or seven years ago\
    \ everyone was into big data."
  sec: 373
  time: '6:13'
  who: Dat
- line: "So you had to learn Spark. In Spark, they had simple stuff like linear regression,\
    \ and logistic regression. But that was not my biggest interest, because I knew\
    \ at the time that big data was just very difficult to do. A lot of people just\
    \ thought that it\u2019s so simple to do, because, yeah\u2026 who brought up MapReduce\
    \ at the time, and everybody was thinking, \u201COkay, in Germany, that would\
    \ work as well.\u201D"
  sec: 404
  time: '6:44'
  who: Dat
- line: "But that was very difficult. That's why my focus was more rather into starting\
    \ the data science practice in Accenture. I was one of the first ones who did\
    \ a data science project here in Germany. But then I realized that a company like\
    \ Accenture is not something that I wanted to work for a long time. So I left\
    \ it pretty early. Accenture is a big company, it's a consultancy. There's still\
    \ a lot of overhead that you need to do. For example, you need to do a lot of\
    \ presentations, you need to talk to clients \u2013 it's more like product management."
  sec: 430
  time: '7:10'
  who: Dat
- line: "And then you have people in India, in Spain \u2014 in offshore centers, where\
    \ people do code delivery. But I thought \u201CI'm still pretty young, and I like\
    \ to code. I don't want to spend my whole time just working on concepts and not\
    \ doing the real thing.\u201D"
  sec: 466
  time: '7:46'
  who: Dat
- line: "And then I moved on after a year. I joined Pivotal. Pivotal is a US software\
    \ company. The main focus was actually to do CloudFoundry. CloudFoundry is similar\
    \ to Kubernetes. I joined Pivotal Data where you have databases like GreenPlum.\
    \ It\u2019s similar to Snowflake or Redshift. It's an MPP database."
  sec: 486
  time: '8:06'
  who: Dat
- line: "They also have a data science team, which teaches customers how to do data\
    \ science. It's also consultancy, but more hands-on. At Pivotal I got to know\
    \ one of the best engineers in the world. They taught me a lot of things \u2013\
    \ what\u2019s programming, what\u2019s test room development, DevOps skills, bringing\
    \ data science into production. This was quite new five years ago. At the time\
    \ everyone was talking about that, but no one really understood how you get a\
    \ data science and machine learning model into production."
  sec: 517
  time: '8:37'
  who: Dat
- line: "I learned a lot about this. I devised my own ideas on how to make it happen.\
    \ Because at the time, no one was really thinking about that. What I was thinking\
    \ was: how do you create this fancy machine learning model? How do you do all\
    \ the hyper parameter tuning? But no one really thought about how \u201CWhat happens\
    \ afterwards?\u201D What happened after day two? Day one \u2014 okay, it's in\
    \ production. But what's day 2, day, 3, day 5, day 6? Because it's not a simple\
    \ app."
  sec: 560
  time: '9:20'
  who: Dat
- line: "Even an app \u2013 when you create an app, you have more feature requests,\
    \ you have feature development, you have bugs coming up, and you need to think\
    \ about that. And this is something that was pretty cool. Other than that, I also\
    \ had to work on nice projects. I did my pet projects as well. I got into window\
    \ vision a lot. And also I work on interesting projects, like, for example, Hydro\
    \ planning prediction. I worked for many interesting customers. And I could also\
    \ travel to many nice locations, because Pivotal was based in Silicon Valley."
  sec: 595
  time: '9:55'
  who: Dat
- line: "They had their main European office in London. It was a very cool experience\
    \ that I had with Pivotal. I left Pivotal after two years. I realized, \u201C\
    Consultancy is nice, you see different customers, you get to know different problems,\
    \ but actually\u2026\u201D As I said, at Pivotal, I started to think about machine\
    \ learning in production. And I was like, \u201COkay, how do I actually find a\
    \ company where I can test my ideas?\u201D"
  sec: 629
  time: '10:29'
  who: Dat
- header: Work at Idealo and Axel Springer
- line: "I looked at some companies, which were interesting for me at the time. I\
    \ applied for several companies. I interviewed for companies like Deutsche Bahn,\
    \ Telekom and whatever. But then, none of these big companies were really interesting\
    \ for me. At that time, I was actually looking for a Head of Data role, like a\
    \ more managerial role. But when you just have three years of work experience,\
    \ you never get this managerial role. They will ask you, \u201COkay, you're too\
    \ young, you don't have the experience to showcase this\u201D. There was this\
    \ position at Idealo and the role required to have eight years of work experience."
  sec: 667
  time: '11:07'
  who: Dat
- line: "But naive me\u2026 Of course, I applied. And luckily, it went through. The\
    \ CTO liked my CV. We had our first conversation. After this conversation I talked\
    \ to the CEO, the CPO, and so on. The process only took two weeks. And the coolest\
    \ thing is \u2014 while I was in the meeting with the CEO, and CPO and CTO, when\
    \ we met on-site \u2014  I could do a little presentation about what you can expect\
    \ from me in the next two years."
  sec: 730
  time: '12:10'
  who: Dat
- line: "That was a very interesting kind of experience \u2014 going through this\
    \ job application. It was not like the usual one. I was literally creating my\
    \ own role in a sense. Then I was hired as a Head of Data. I was responsible with\
    \ two other co-heads, for areas like business intelligence, data warehouse, web\
    \ analytics."
  sec: 770
  time: '12:50'
  who: Dat
- line: "While I was at the interview, I was pitched, \u201CWe need a data science\
    \ machine learning team.\u201D Idealo is a data company, but we haven't made use\
    \ of all the data that we have at the moment. My two years at Idealo, from my\
    \ perspective, were really successful."
  sec: 804
  time: '13:24'
  who: Dat
- line: "I had a nice team. We did a lot of open source projects. We kind of birthed\
    \ a brand for Idealo \u2014 that we have a strong machine learning team. It's\
    \ not like when I left, everything was gone. I tried to build a very sustainable\
    \ culture in the company. I don't want to leave a company with everything, but\
    \ I want to leave a place there that I built up."
  sec: 771
  time: '12:51'
  who: Dat
- line: "That was something that I really liked. But after two years of Idealo, I\
    \ also realized, \u201COkay, I built up this team very successfully. What's next?\u201D\
    \ I cannot stay there forever. I was young. I was like, \u201COkay, I managed\
    \ to do that. I did my learning but what is the next step?\u201D Then I decided,\
    \ \u201COkay, I did it for Idealo. But how do you do this on a corporate level?\
    \ For a holding like Axel Springer?\u201D"
  sec: 867
  time: '14:27'
  who: Dat
- line: "Axel Springer at the time, one and a half years ago, was like\u2026 They\
    \ didn't know what research was. It's not a company that is driven by research.\
    \ Because they just didn't know what research was. But if you want to be a tech\
    \ company, you really need research and an open source component within the holding.\
    \ Then I approached Stephanie Caspar, she's one of the board members at Axel Springer.\
    \ I was telling her, \u201CHey, these are my ideas. What if we try to create these\
    \ main central functions? With evangelizing around Axel Springer, what AI is about,\
    \ what research is about, and how we actually can work together.\u201D"
  sec: 908
  time: '15:08'
  who: Dat
- line: "One of the driving factors why I did that was I wanted to turn Axel Springer\
    \ into a tech company. So it's not just taking the AI angle \u2013 to turn it\
    \ into a more tech-oriented company. Then I did it. I did it for one and a half\
    \ years. I built an AI team again. I took some people with me from Idealo \u2014\
    \ they wanted to come with me. I had a few people. And my role there was\u2026\
    \ sometimes it\u2019s called a \u201Cmachine leader\u201D, because I didn't have\
    \ a lot of people function. But more like, \u201CHow do you talk to the Managing\
    \ Directors?\u201D. Shape them so that they go into the right direction."
  sec: 966
  time: '16:06'
  who: Dat
- line: It's much harder when you do this. Management is very difficult. It's not
    like you have a team and this team is one you've hired. But now you have many,
    many different managers on the same level. How do you make sure that they are
    going in the direction that you want them to go? Also, when looking back at my
    time at Axel Springer, there were a lot of ups and downs. The downside, of course,
    is that it's a big corporate. It was a big challenge for me.
  sec: 1012
  time: '16:52'
  who: Dat
- line: "So I started thinking \u201COK, two years is enough\u201D. To do this whole\
    \ transformation, it takes much longer to do this transformation on an organizational\
    \ standpoint. And also, one thing that I didn't think through was \u201CHey, to\
    \ do this kind of transformation, you just need much more people under you to\
    \ drive this transformation, and also kind of budget.\u201D You need profit and\
    \ loss ownership."
  sec: 1045
  time: '17:25'
  who: Dat
- line: But despite that, I managed to drive a lot of things. I managed a couple of
    open source projects. I was one of the initiators of the Axel Springer techcon,
    which is the first big tech conference that we had within Axel Springer.
  sec: 1074
  time: '17:54'
  who: Dat
- line: "In pre-Corona when we did it, we had 700 participants from all around the\
    \ world. That was one of the first big things where we could say, \u201CHey, we're\
    \ driving Axel Springer in the right direction of being a tech company.\u201D\
    \ And also, the other thing we did was the Axel Springer tech blog \u2014 where\
    \ people within the holding, within the companies can create articles and blog\
    \ posts on this tech blog."
  sec: 1092
  time: '18:12'
  who: Dat
- line: "This is something that is still living after I'm gone. I really like it,\
    \ it\u2019s still thriving. Because I started it. If I think about this, these\
    \ are really small things, not very big things that I did. Everyone could do them.\
    \ You just need someone to do that, to start this thing. You give people the freedom\
    \ to write articles, go to this conference, and so on."
  sec: 1124
  time: '18:44'
  who: Dat
- line: "Some of you know that I resigned from Axel Springer. When I joined Axel Springer,\
    \ I thought, \u201COk, I'm not going to stay there forever and I'm either going\
    \ to do my own things or find a niche, managing director / top management positions,\
    \ so that I can drive more things.\u201D Because my credo is \u201CAlways know\
    \ that you need more ownership and sometimes older ships come with power.\u201D\
    \ And power you either acquire through a major director position, or you create\
    \ your own company."
  sec: 1158
  time: '19:18'
  who: Dat
- line: "During Corona time the idea came much stronger. I was like, \u201CEverything\
    \ is so slow. Everything at Axel Springer is so slow. It's a COVID world. You\
    \ cannot be there forever. Because you're still 32, not 45 \u2013 you don't have\
    \ a family yet. So you really need to go out and think about \u2014 what's the\
    \ next step?\u201D"
  sec: 1198
  time: '19:58'
  who: Dat
- header: Story of Priceloop
- line: "Then I was talking to a few friends. One idea was \u201COkay, maybe you go\
    \ back to Vietnam.\u201D I'm not from Vietnam, I'm from Germany, but maybe go\
    \ to Vietnam and go to a consultancy, because the tech is really strong there,\
    \ and maybe an idea grows out of this"
  sec: 1226
  time: '20:26'
  who: Dat
- line: But luckily my current co-founder, Dr. Richard Schwenke approached me. We
    left at the same time from our companies. Richard co-founded Contorion, which
    is an ecommerce for tooling. He co-founded that company, he was the managing director,
    but he sold the company in 2017. And he wanted to create another company, again.
    He's also not that old, and he still really wanted to create a company from scratch.
  sec: 1248
  time: '20:48'
  who: Dat
- line: Because if you're too old, it can be very, very tiring, in a startup to create
    something from scratch again. He approached me with his idea of pricing because
    he created a data science team at Contorion already. They implemented a pricing
    algorithm. They've been dealing with pricing for three years already, and they
    had an uplift of 25% with the things they've been doing.
  sec: 1288
  time: '21:28'
  who: Dat
- line: "They did a lot of A/B testing to find the right calibration, hyper parameters\
    \ for the machine learning models, and so on. It's a nice idea \u2014 I had pricing\
    \ at university. When you're doing operation research, you also will focus on\
    \ revenue management or dynamic programming. It has a lot to do with pricing.\
    \ Pricing is a decision that you need to do in a control theory."
  sec: 1320
  time: '22:00'
  who: Dat
- line: "I was like, \u201CYeah, that sounds like a good idea.\u201D He was looking\
    \ for a technical co-founder. And I was looking for a business co-founder. So,\
    \ it was a really good combination of us two. We had a discussion around August.\
    \ And then it was clear, \u201COkay, I'm going to resign from the company.\u201D\
    \ And he was also \u201CYeah, okay, I'm gonna leave in October as well\u201D.\
    \ We left at end of September, both at the same time. And now we started Priceloop.\
    \ So, Priceloop is my new venture together with Richard. And our goal is to disrupt\
    \ the pricing industry."
  sec: 1346
  time: '22:26'
  who: Dat
- line: "As far as you know, there's many AI software systems out there, also for\
    \ pricing. Most of these pricing servers are actually more closed solutions. You\
    \ get the data from your client, and then you put it into your system \u2013 maybe\
    \ you have a login \u2013 and it's probably hosted on some cloud provider, and\
    \ then you give out the price."
  sec: 1399
  time: '23:19'
  who: Dat
- line: 'That''s what most of the services do: you give the data, and then you get
    the labels and so on. But what we want to do is, we want to create a pricing framework
    or library at the end. We want to give data science teams, pricing teams a pricing
    framework. So that people like you, maybe OLX, will use us in the future.'
  sec: 1433
  time: '23:53'
  who: Dat
- line: "It's so easy to create your own pricing strategies. Then, of course, we have\
    \ commercial solutions on top of that, which we also will offer this to other\
    \ customers. Because if they like to use our framework \u2014 we are a company\
    \ \u2014 we also need to finance ourselves in some way. But the overall goal is\
    \ actually to create a whitebox solution."
  sec: 1460
  time: '24:20'
  who: Dat
- line: "We don't want to take away the pricing manager. We don't want to tell them\
    \ \u201CHey, if you're going to use this, you don't need to hire a pricing manager\
    \ or you can fire the pricing manager.\u201D No, we want to give them a frame\
    \ of a tool. So that they can make better decisions with their pricing teams.\
    \ And pricing is a core component of many, many companies. And that shouldn't\
    \ be a blackbox solution. That's where I am so far. It's a nice, interesting ride."

- line: "A long story. But very interesting. What stood out to me was, first of all,\
    \ you mentioned Andrew Ng and his course on Coursera. I think so many people ended\
    \ up where they are now, because of that course. Including myself. Yeah, it changed\
    \ the lives of so many people. I remember, I started following you on LinkedIn\
    \ when you were already at Idealo. And your team contributed to so many open-source\
    \ projects. I think there was an image quality library. I though \u201Cthis team\
    \ is doing great on the open source front, pushing out amazing stuff.\u201D The\
    \ projects also have a lot of stars on GitHub, which shows that a lot of people\
    \ are interested. That's a great job. And I'm curious about your startup now.\
    \ So you said you just started it. So Richard and you \u2013 do you have somebody\
    \ else working with you now?"
  sec: 1525
  time: '25:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The way we started our startup is not very usual. So since both of us
    are experienced, we finalized our funding and already signed four people. One
    of the machinery engineers just started this week. Three more are coming. We're
    going to make two more offers. We want to be 10 people by Q2 2021. We got a plan
    to do our seed round in 2021. Then we're going to hire more people.
  sec: 1598
  time: '26:38'
  who: Dat
- line: "Our goal is to create a strong tactical product team. Which focuses on disrupting\
    \ one of the industries. We believe that the future is in open research, and contribution\
    \ from outside and contributing into ideas for many, many different organizations.\
    \ We see that direction from other startups like Hugging Face \u2014 a similar\
    \ example. It\u2019s getting so strong and people are using it in production.\
    \ Because of the open research. And at the moment I haven't seen that in pricing\
    \ so far."

- header: How to start building a data team
- line: That's an amazing topic. Many, many different companies, ecommerce companies
    will benefit from that. I know that it will all work out. So now you're already
    in the process of building a team. Some people already signed their offers, and
    soon start working. How do you start building a team? How do you approach this
    process? What should you do first? Do you first select a project or you start
    immediately with hiring. How to approach this process?
  sec: 1696
  time: '28:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's hard to rationalize my mind. I would say it's a combination of both.\
    \ Some companies just start with hiring people, and then build. And some companies,\
    \ they need a big, big plan, and then they're going to hire people. Our approach\
    \ \u2014 this is together. I'm driving it from the technical perspective and we\
    \ have a project. We know what we are going to build, but it's still unclear.\
    \ Unclear in this way that we don't know. We know what the end goal should be\
    \ \u2013 like the vision."
  sec: 1737

    \ data quality process. If you don't have clean data, you can create new data.\
    \ For example, for a lot of our projects at Idealo, we didn't have the data. We\
    \ collected the data and this takes. Sometimes it takes half a year or a year\
    \ to collect enough data to solve a problem. But you have to start someday, because\
