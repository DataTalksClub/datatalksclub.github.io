transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about visualising machine learning. And we have a special
    guest today, Meor. You probably saw Meor on LinkedIn where he shares amazing visualisation
    about different machine learning concepts. One of the last ones I remember well
    was about drift in machine learning. That was a pretty cool one. How often do
    you post things?

  who: Alexey
- line: "I used to do it regularly. I started sometime last year and I was doing almost\
    \ one visual every day. But now I'm starting to do it a bit less regularly. But\
    \ I\u2019m hoping to put more visuals soon and go back to my earlier cadence."

    our event!

- line: Before we go into our main topic of visualising machine learning, let's start
    with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 177
  time: '2:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was introduced to machine learning almost 10 years ago. I decided to stop
    whatever I was doing in my career and do a master's degree doing research in limb
    prosthetics. I was introduced to machine learning. I did this master's in bio
    engineering, with a plan of doing a PhD. But I stopped after the master's and
    continued without a PhD.
  sec: 186
  time: '3:06'
  who: Meor
- line: Back then the excitement around AI and machine learning was not today. The
    research was relatively slow. There was not much breakthrough. I didn't see many
    applications in the real world at the time. I decided to go back to working and
    joined a company in the telecommunications industry. I was doing data engineering
    and analytics for telecommunications data. I did that for 6-7 years. But I wanted
    to go into education or even childhood education.
  sec: 222
  time: '3:42'
  who: Meor
- line: In 2019 I decided that I wanted to do something else. I went into self-employment
    mode and became an independent consultant. Initially, I was doing training and
    consultancy in telecommunications analytics and slowly moved into education in
    childhood. I've always wanted to do AI and machine learning which revived my interest
    in the past couple of years. I did AI educational resources for middle schools
    and high schools under the name of x-square, it's still there.
  sec: 222
  time: '3:42'
  who: Meor
- line: That was happening right until the middle of last year when I encountered
    a fun way of creating educational materials for adults using visuals. I came upon
    this approach without any background in design. I was just trying to apply visuals
    into explaining the concept of machine learning. That's when I started to create
    these visuals under the name of kDimensions. It has been going on for almost 8-9
    months now. That's where I'm at currently. I'm still doing the other things that
    I started before. But slowly my focus is now on the kDimensions.
  sec: 222
  time: '3:42'
  who: Meor
- header: kDimensions
- line: Why this name?
  sec: 370
  time: '6:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's quite obvious. It borrows from the concept of machine learning - dimensionality
    reduction. For example, if you talk about a machine learning problem, you have
    data that is very big, let's say 1000s of 1000s of features. What you can do is
    compress it into several features that are much less than what it was before while
    maintaining the same amount of information. That's the concept behind PCA and
    other algorithms of dimensionality reduction. I had the same idea with visuals
    as well. That's where the power of visuals comes in. You compress a lot of information
    into a visual that you otherwise would write down. With a visual, you will retain
    the same information as with the text, but you can go straight to the essence.
    People can get it immediately.
  sec: 375
  time: '6:15'
  who: Meor
- line: That's the idea. K is the common letter that people use when reducing the
    dimensions from n dimensions to k dimensions when people do PCA, that's why the
    name came.
  sec: 375
  time: '6:15'
  who: Meor
- line: I expected that. That's a good idea for the name. Take a complex idea, simplify
    it.
  sec: 455
  time: '7:35'
  who: Alexey
- header: Being self-employed
- line: In 2019, you became self-employed, and started being an independent consultant.
    You started also working on these visuals. Was it scary for you to go solo?
  sec: 455
  time: '7:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was because I've always wanted to do it for a long time, even after I completed
    my Master's because from then on, I wanted to do something in the education space.
    Throughout my career, I was doing some other small ventures in education, especially
    childhood education. But of course, with the question of having a job, you don't
    make the full commitment, because you have this something that you can fall back
    on. But I thought the time was just right for me to be full. I didn't have a clear
    plan. I do have some ideas and went into it. Luckily, I'm managing well, so far.
  sec: 484
  time: '8:04'
  who: Meor
- header: Visual engineering
- line: There is a guy called Jack Butcher. He has a Twitter profile called "visualise
    value", and a website as well. They see some similarities in what you do and what
    Jack is doing. Did you get inspiration from him with coming up with all these
    visuals? Or what kind of sources of inspiration did you have when you decided,
    "I want to follow this format". How did it start for you?
  sec: 532
  time: '8:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: It started with him. I was browsing through my feed and came upon this very
    simple and minimal visual, but that gives a bit weight in terms of the perspective
    of the message that he wants to bring. I never saw such visuals and started to
    dig deep into his approach. I enrolled in his course called "How to visualise
    value" which explains how he goes through this process of making visuals and the
    idea behind it. I was mind blown by the philosophy behind it. I wouldn't say he's
    the first one who has done it, but he made it mainstream.
  sec: 568
  time: '9:28'
  who: Meor
- line: "I still haven't figured out the right term for this whole category yet, but\
    \ the closest I can find visual engineering. It's not \u201Cengineering\u201D\
    \ in the technical sense, but it's about using visuals for you to convey a message.\
    \ You create a visual that amplifies or makes better what you are trying to convey.\
    \ Jack's visuals fall under this category. I was amazed."
  sec: 568
  time: '9:28'
  who: Meor
- line: That's when it all started for me. I was already doing machine learning educational
    materials, back then primarily with X-square for childhood education. But I thought
    that I could apply the same thing - simplifying missionary concepts, and applying
    them using visuals.
  sec: 568
  time: '9:28'
  who: Meor
- line: There are many reasons to do it. One of the reasons is that there is more
    information that we need, when it comes to machine learning because there are
    so many resources, there are courses, books, blog posts, code examples, it goes
    on. How do you curate this content? How do you condense this content into something
    digestible for people?
  sec: 700
  time: '11:40'
  who: Meor
- line: "It's an interesting industry to be in right now: a lot of people are interested\
    \ in this subject. People are motivated to learn. I hope to be able to give them\
    \ something to learn, to open the door for them before they explore things in\
    \ more detail. For them to be able to grasp the concepts simply - to \u201Cget\
    \ it\u201D at the intuition level, before they go further into what they are doing."
  sec: 700
  time: '11:40'
  who: Meor
- line: It's not just Jack, there are many other people I look up to. In the machine
    learning space, there are a lot of very talented people who create visuals. First
    and foremost, for me, one of them is Jay Alammar. He has a blog that explains
    concepts around neural networks. For example, word2vec transformers. He has a
    blog post illustrated transformers and has a lot of other kinds of materials as
    well. That's the resource I go to to understand these concepts. I found it relatable
    for me to visually look at the concepts and get the intuition before going into
    the math, before going into the code.
  sec: 700
  time: '11:40'
  who: Meor
- line: The list goes on. For example, StatQuest with Josh Starmer. He simplifies
    the understanding of machine learning and data science using visuals by way of
    video. Luis Serrano, as well. He has this book "Grokking Machine Learning". He
    also creates wonderful videos that explain these concepts.
  sec: 700
  time: '11:40'
  who: Meor
- line: When you pair visuals with code and math, then you go deeper into any subject
    in this field.
  sec: 700
  time: '11:40'
  who: Meor
- header: Constrain yourself to get creative
- line: "You were already in the educational space. Then you were browsing through\
    \ your feed, and saw a visual from Jake Butcher. You thought, \"This is so cool.\
    \ I want to do something similar.\" When I saw images from Jack, I thought \u201C\
    It would be cool if somebody would do something similar for machine learning\u201D\
    . A few months after that, I saw you on LinkedIn and that was it! I said, \u201C\
    This is as if Jack would cover ML\u201D. I didn\u2019t take his course. But when\
    \ I listened to a podcast with him, he said that \u201Crestrict yourself - on\
    \ purpose\u201D. He only uses two colors and simple shapes."
  sec: 852
  time: '14:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: "He also has a lot of very interesting perspectives about visuals. And beyond\
    \ visuals. One of the things I took away from him is that you have to introduce\
    \ constraints in your work. It\u2019s true for visuals and for anything in life,\
    \ especially when you're creating something."
  sec: 916
  time: '15:16'
  who: Meor
- line: "He uses just two colors - black and white, geometrical shapes, abstract concepts,\
    \ and that's it. He says \u201Cconstraints breed creativity\u201D. It's ironic.\
    \ People would think that to be creative, you have to have a lot of resources\
    \ with you, talent, a lot of tools, and a lot of ideas. That is true. But when\
    \ you introduce constraints, you're forced to work with what you have. That's\
    \ when you get focused. You're not worried about the other things that you can\
    \ potentially do. When you see the visuals from Jack - you can do amazing things\
    \ with the constraint that you impose on yourself."
  sec: 916
  time: '15:16'
  who: Meor
- line: You use only three colors?
  sec: 1005
  time: '16:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'For me, it''s about explaining technical and complex concepts. I tried to
    use two colors, but it didn''t work for that purpose. So I use three colors. The
    background is dark, and just three main colors: red, blue and white. I found that
    is the right equilibrium. It has served me well, so far.'
  sec: 1010
  time: '16:50'
  who: Meor
- header: Coming up with ideas
- line: "How do you come up with these ideas? For example, you recently created an\
    \ illustration about \u201Cdrift\u201D. How did it happen?"
  sec: 1053
  time: '17:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: "My approach is first to introduce the constraint - the style constraint that\
    \ we have just discussed. The other thing - introduce constraints in terms of\
    \ the topic that you want to visualize. For example, \u201Cdrift\u201D that you\
    \ just mentioned. I\u2019m not yet sure how I\u2019m going to make it, but I will\
    \ stick with it and I'll make sure that I can create some kind of visual related\
    \ to drift before going on to other topics."
  sec: 1061
  time: '17:41'
  who: Meor
- line: Once you have the topic, you introduce a time constraint. Within a few minutes,
    you put on paper whatever you have in your mind. That's when the magic happens.
    The moment you have something written or sketched, you can improve on it. You
    cannot improve on blank things, but you can improve on things that are already
    there, no matter how ugly looks now and how different it will look at the end.
  sec: 1061
  time: '17:41'
  who: Meor
- header: Visualising difficult concepts
- line: "The other thing that works for me is trying to visualize not \u201Cwhat it\
    \ is\u201D, but \u201Cwhat it means\u201D. What I learned from Jack, when you\
    \ try to visualize a concept, you don't visualize the noun, but the verb or the\
    \ objective. That's when you can extract the message that you want to deliver."
  sec: 1135
  time: '18:55'
  who: Meor
- line: In the drift example, I was using a catapult throwing the ball into the basket.
    At the time, the idea I had was about accuracy. Not for models - if you're thinking
    about models and algorithms, then you're stuck with boxes and squares or rectangles
    and arrows. This is the noun of what you're trying to represent.
  sec: 1135
  time: '18:55'
  who: Meor
- line: "But try to understand what it\u2019s trying to do. It\u2019s trying to be\
    \ accurate. That's when you think about metaphors. What kind of objects can you\
    \ use to represent that? It brings another benefit: if you use metaphors and objects\
    \ that people can relate with, you make the concept less intimidating. If you\
    \ use rectangles and arrows, people can get an idea, but not quite. Then they\
    \ feel like they are not yet attached to the idea. But when you show everyday\
    \ things, they understand these things, and it becomes the bridge to understand\
    \ the real concept that you want to represent. Metaphors and abstract concepts\
    \ are the two things that you may want to look into if you're trying to visualize\
    \ things."
  sec: 1135
  time: '18:55'
  who: Meor
- line: "Okay, so first, you think, \"I want to create something on drift\u201D Then\
    \ you give yourself a bit of time, use a timer, set it to 5-10 minutes. And then\
    \ you start brainstorming, like \u201CHow can I show the action? What is the action\
    \ there?\u201D By the way, what was the action in that visualization of drift?"
  sec: 1286
  time: '21:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: The original model is just a basket with data. If the catapult is not functioning
    well, you miss. If the ball changes its shape, it misses too. That's the data,
    the source. But conceptually, it's about the target that is changing. From a basket,
    you're changing it to a basketball game. You need to hit the target, so you need
    to adapt your source to match the target.
  sec: 1323
  time: '22:03'
  who: Meor
- line: "I can give another example - the concept of data-centered AI. When people\
    \ talk about data-centered AI, it does not mean that we relax on model development.\
    \ We have focused so much on model development, fine-tuning, and all that, but\
    \ haven\u2019t focused on data. So when we talk about data-centric AI, people\
    \ think that it\u2019s about data, not the model. The model is there as it is.\
    \ But the thing is, you need to have both, you need to have balance."
  sec: 1323
  time: '22:03'
  who: Meor
- line: "That was when I figured out this idea of an airplane - on one side with a\
    \ wing of a modern aircraft, and the other side is less developed, the wings from\
    \ the 50s. For the aircraft to function well, you need to balance both sides.\
    \ Algorithms on one side and data on the other side. It\u2019s not like one over\
    \ the other, but both at the same time. People might be able to relate to that."
  sec: 1323
  time: '22:03'
  who: Meor
- header: The process of creating visuals
- line: Can you walk us through the process of creating it? How did you come up with
    the idea? Did you want to create something on data-centric AI? Or first, you had
    an image of your plane in your head and then you did this? Can you walk us through
    the entire process, from the beginning before you even started working on this
    to the end where you publish this on LinkedIn?
  sec: 1447
  time: '24:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I don't have any rigid ideas. Whenever I'm reading a new concept or trying\
    \ to understand new material, to understand it and get to the core of the message,\
    \ I'll write down the concepts without adding any visuals. I put them in a long\
    \ list. The ideas don\u2019t always come immediately, so it\u2019s important to\
    \ maintain this list. I review this list every week. If something occurs frequently,\
    \ it\u2019s interesting and I want to nail my understanding of this term, I put\
    \ it to the shortlist."
  sec: 1478
  time: '24:38'
  who: Meor
- line: "Once I've got the shortlist, then I figure out how to visualize these concepts.\
    \ I start to think backward. For each concept I want to visualize, I think \u201C\
    what is the key message?\u201D. That's also part of the learning - when you are\
    \ trying to learn something, you want to get what is the essence of this concept.\
    \ For example, for drift, things are changing - that\u2019s the essence of what\
    \ you want to learn. The source changes or the target, and you're trying to try\
    \ to adopt that. So that's the concept that you try to learn."
  sec: 1560
  time: '26:00'
  who: Meor
- line: From there, you decide on how you want to figure out what the verb is. What's
    the key message? What does it mean? Then we try to translate that into a visual.
  sec: 1560
  time: '26:00'
  who: Meor
- line: There are different kinds of visuals that I find interesting. The first kind
    is about concepts - machine learning, data-centric AI, drift, and all this. But
    the other thing that is also very interesting to visualize is the emotional aspect.
    I'm talking about the realities in the field.
  sec: 1560
  time: '26:00'
  who: Meor
- line: "For example, we talked about creating a data science project and a data science\
    \ solution. Normally you start with a problem, then you work your way towards\
    \ the solution. But a lot of people - me first and foremost - are guilty of starting\
    \ with the solution first, and working backward to find a problem that can be\
    \ solved. You\u2019re so interested in the algorithm or the solution that you're\
    \ building."
  sec: 1560
  time: '26:00'
  who: Meor
- line: Can we visualize it? If you can show the arrow should be from the left to
    right. But what you're doing is from the left to right. You try to touch these
    emotional points that the viewer can relate to and understand where you're coming
    from. That's also interesting for me to explore.
  sec: 1560
  time: '26:00'
  who: Meor
- line: "So to summarise it. When you consume content, you keep a long list of things\
    \ that you read about. Let's say you read about drift today, then you take a note\
    \ and read about other things. Then you see drift again, and you realize it\u2019\
    s interesting for you. Then you start spending more time learning about it, and\
    \ then you move them from the long list with ideas to the short list.  For ideas\
    \ in the short list, you take them and try to elaborate them. You think \u201C\
    How can you see action there?\u201D. You also mentioned that there are two kinds\
    \ of visuals you like creating - concept and visuals that convey emotional aspect.\
    \ So longlist, shortlist, getting some inspiration, brainstorming, and then actually\
    \ sitting down and creating the visual?"

  who: Alexey
- line: "To be frank, it doesn't always work that way. For example, ideas might come\
    \ to me when I\u2019m in the shower or driving. That's why it's handy to have\
    \ a sketchbook that is dedicated to visuals. Whenever I have an idea, even if\
    \ I haven\u2019t figured it out yet, I sketch it. It's also useful to have an\
    \ app that you can use to immediately write down your ideas and quickly log in\
    \ what you have in your mind. That has been handy for me."

- line: What do you use for creating your visuals?
  sec: 1874
  time: '31:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: I use Figma. I don't have any background in design at all, I'm a pure engineer.
    I have been an engineer for many years. I'm not anywhere near people with artistic
    skills. I've tried Canva when creating content for x-square, so I explored that
    too. But it doesn't have much flexibility. I've also tried Adobe Illustrator.
    That's way too advanced for me, it has a learning curve that you have to go through
    before you can become comfortable in using it.
  sec: 1877
  time: '31:17'
  who: Meor
- line: In the course, Jack introduced me to Figma, which is the sweet spot between
    Canva and illustrator. It's not that hard to operate, but you have a lot of flexibility
    to create exactly what you want. The learning curve is not steep at all. You can
    get up and running in a couple of days. If I can do it, most other people can
    do it as well.
  sec: 1877
  time: '31:17'
  who: Meor
- line: "There are other tools as well. I\u2019m an engineer, so my approach is more\
    \ on geometric shapes, vectors and vector images. But if you\u2019re more artistic,\
    \ then you may prefer hand sketch."
  sec: 1877
  time: '31:17'
  who: Meor
- line: So, you have a sketch note. When you have an idea, you take sketches or sometimes
    just notes. Then use Figma to create the visual. Do you always first create a
    draft on a piece of paper before moving to Figma?
  sec: 2011
  time: '33:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Most of the time, I will write it down on paper first. When the idea is not
    developed yet, you have a basic concept of what you want to do. You have to figure
    out what kind of objects to put there. For example, you have the relationships,
    one thing is here, the other thing is there. Then you want to make an arrow. You
    want to create a contrast. You haven't figured out the end visual yet. But once
    you put it down, it's ingrained in your mind. After a couple of days, when you
    figure out how to do this, transfer it to Figma.
  sec: 2033
  time: '33:53'
  who: Meor
- line: It's not always the case though. Sometimes I get an idea and immediately jump
    on it. The number of visuals that I made has grown, so I have a lot of existing
    assets that I can use to create something new. It's not always the case that you're
    creating something from scratch. You can utilize objects and high-level concepts
    from visuals you made, reuse and modify them according to the new thing that you
    want to create.
  sec: 2033
  time: '33:53'
  who: Meor
- line: "If you need a catapult or a basket, you just go to that \u201Cdrift\u201D\
    \ visual, copy the catapult and paste to the new image and use it. That's cool."

- header: Learning to create visuals for engineers
- line: For somebody like you - an engineer who hasn't worked with anything like Figma
    - how can they start creating visuals? How can they learn this?
  sec: 2132
  time: '35:32'

    content to explain it or teach others, your perspective becomes different. When
    you have the intention to teach, you're more invested. You're looking at the material
    on the surface. You're trying to dig deep. If needed, you will look at other materials
    that are supplementing what you're trying to understand. You get to the bottom
    of what you want to know. Compare it with learning just for consumption. Your
    understanding is totally different - you get a much deeper understanding. If you're
    going to create something with visuals or anything, if you have the intention
    of explaining it to others, it makes 10 times more impact compared to doing without
    it.

    ago. This way you create a visual for the entire article.

    \ cannot push yourself to create something because now you're diluting the value.\
    \ The most important thing is to deliver the message efficiently. If you can relate\
