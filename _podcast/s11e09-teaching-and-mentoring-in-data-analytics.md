title: 'Designing FinTech Data Analytics Curriculum: Fraud Detection, BigQuery Labs
  & Mentoring'
transcript:
- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: 'Guest Overview: Irina Brudaru — teacher, curriculum developer, mentor in
    data analytics'
- line: This week, we'll talk about teaching and mentoring in data analytics. We have
    a special guest today, Irina. Irina works as a teacher and curriculum developer
    for data analytics and data science at FrauenLoop, which is an NGO in Germany.
    Judging from the name, Frauen, it’s women.
  sec: 68
  time: '1:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, and also AI build, actually as well.
  sec: 84
  time: '1:24'
  who: Irina
- line: Irina studied computer science in Romania and Germany. She has worked at a
    variety of tech companies in Berlin, Amsterdam, and the Bay Area. She's very active
    as a mentor in the area of data analytics and leadership. She is also an activist
    with a focus on supporting women in tech. So welcome, Irina. Welcome to our show.
  sec: 88
  time: '1:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you very much for having me, Alexey. I'm very happy to be here and to
    tell you all about these things. These are my moonlighting jobs. The nine to five
    is daylight and teaching and all of these things are my Moonlighting. But it's
    a great passion and important to me.
  sec: 108
  time: '1:48'
  who: Irina
- line: Okay. I also wanted to mention that the questions for today’s interview are
    prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, for your help. Let's get started.
  sec: 124
  time: '2:04'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Origins: early computing, Romania education, Max Planck research'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of teaching and mentoring in data analytics,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 133
  time: '2:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. How many minutes? [laughs]
  sec: 142
  time: '2:22'
  who: Irina
- line: Ten?
  sec: 146
  time: '2:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] All right! That''s more than enough.'
  sec: 147
  time: '2:27'
  who: Irina
- line: Five? I don't know. Take your time. [chuckles]
  sec: 149
  time: '2:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: I come from Romania. I was born in ‘83 to a family of nerds. Luckily enough,
    I got to code already at age 12 because I got bored in my school and I wanted
    to see what the heck that computer is doing, which was Basic.
  sec: 151
  time: '2:31'
  who: Irina
- line: At what age?
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: 11- 12.
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Irina
- line: 11. [nods]
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: They were making us knit and I finished all the knitting and embroidery. I
    don't know what this is called, but you know what I mean. And I was like “I’m
    done with this. Now give that green screen computer. I want it.” Of course, we
    also grew up with mathematics books, and with our dad doing puzzles.
  sec: 172
  time: '2:52'
  who: Irina
- line: I always knew I wanted to go to mathematics and computer science after that,
    because I really liked it. Funny enough, my brother was always faster than me
    and he was like, “I'm not gonna study computer science.” “But I am. I have to
    be the quickest.” We had a very geeky childhood. My dad was a professor in AI
    and my mom was a database analyst.
  sec: 172
  time: '2:52'
  who: Irina
- line: That generation’s data analyst.
  sec: 218
  time: '3:38'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Industry Transition: data consulting, BI, Google and product analytics
    experience'
- line: Basically, yeah. Exactly. I always wanted to study computer science. This
    is what I chose. I did my Bachelor's in Romania and then I moved to Germany for
    my Master's. I wanted to do research and I wanted to do things that I knew could
    not be done in Romania at the time. The industry did not support that kind of
    direction. So I decided to do a Master's in research at Max Planck Germany, and
    then take it from there. This was my journey. I loved that.
  sec: 221
  time: '3:41'
  who: Irina
- line: I recommend studying at Max Planck to anyone – it's like a mini-Google with
    high impostor syndrome. I did one year and a half of PhD after that and I realized
    that this doesn't make me think. The teaching does and the students do – the classes
    do. But I like to work in something that has an impact in the real world and I
    felt like the PhD was not really connected to it. So that's how I landed in Berlin.
  sec: 221
  time: '3:41'
  who: Irina
- line: I started with a very generic role as a data consultant or engineer, and then
    moved slowly and slowly towards data – all in all four years, where I reached
    out the role of a BI manager. I was disappointed about the layoffs that year in
    DaWanda. And I remember, “Okay, let's change the city or the scene a little bit.”
    So that's why I took an offer from Google and I moved to Munich.
  sec: 221
  time: '3:41'
  who: Irina
- line: I was working in the advertising department in publishers, on a technical
    ladder, taking care of really large clients for Google. It was a  normal job,
    nine to five [metal dropping] promoted so you have to find other projects that
    are aligned with your strengths and skills. I chose data, data logs, data models
    and forecasting – if you do this, then you get more money out of that. This is
    how I got into the whole workflows and pipelines. This was my most coolest project
    back then. Then I moved to San Francisco, because I really wanted to report to
    a female manager, who still works there in that org. There were not many female
    managers anyway.
  sec: 221
  time: '3:41'
  who: Irina
- line: That was at Google, right?
  sec: 374
  time: '6:14'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'International Roles & Management: San Francisco, Netherlands, Berlin; leading
    data teams'
- line: Yeah. In the German offices, I don't remember female managers. But in the
    San Francisco office, there were. I have to say this because I think it is very
    important in terms of the percentage of women that are in tech – I reported to
    a woman manager for the first time at age 32. I was working in a team where they
    were something else than men at age 32. So we know that we have a gender gap present
    in Germany. I'm not going to continue more with Google. I took on other roles,
    did some research papers, and I moved from buy side and sell side – I wanted to
    know as much as possible that I could get from this particular org, add cloud
    on top of it, and then I left Google and kind of merged all my worlds into one.
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Irina
- line: From then on, I worked in the Netherlands as a consultant. Then I started,
    again, the managing path. Actually, the first team I managed was a team of data
    engineers. And I really liked them, because they did stand-ups early and I love
    a good early standup. A year now, I'm back in Berlin. I'm a manager of analytics,
    but I can also do data engineering, so I can wear very many hats. As I mentioned,
    I really liked teaching during my PhD. This is something that I kept investing
    in all the time after I left. That means going back to Romania, to my computer
    science high school and telling kids what they can do with it, encouraging women
    to study, or becoming part of the first lean-in group a couple of years ago in
    Berlin.
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Irina
- line: But when I got really serious about it, when my brother moved in with me,
    which was 10-11 years ago, and he saw that I was so happy with my job. He said,
    “What do you do, Irina? I don't know what you do.” He studied marketing. “Tell
    me. How do you come happy after work? What's that? I want to be part of it.” So
    yeah, he was my first student and it was pretty successful, I would say. That
    made me enroll myself as a mentor in other programs as well.
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Irina
- line: So your brother was doing marketing and he wanted to get… [cross-talk] Sorry?
  sec: 512
  time: '8:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: He was also doing a lot of things, like IT support. He's also a nerd, but
    in his own way. More on the hardware part.
  sec: 518
  time: '8:38'
  who: Irina
- line: So he was doing marketing and a lot of other stuff and he saw this world of
    data – and you helped him to get in data, right? So you mentored him.
  sec: 525
  time: '8:45'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Early Mentoring Wins: mentoring family, interns, and career pivot stories'
- line: Yeah, teaching SQL, databases, queries…
  sec: 537
  time: '8:57'
  who: Irina
- line: And then he started working as a data analyst or data scientist?
  sec: 539
  time: '8:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah – a data analyst. I'm so proud of him because he said, “I have experience
    in IT support and I want to go into BI. You have two internships in both of these
    areas. Give them to me both and I will convince you to enroll me full time.” I’m
    so proud of his “sass”. [chuckles] It requires courage. He did a great job, so
    they hired him. Now, the rest is history because he's doing great.
  sec: 544
  time: '9:04'
  who: Irina
- line: Do you like the process of mentoring people?
  sec: 570
  time: '9:30'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Mentoring Methods: visual explanations, learner-centered teaching techniques'
- line: Yeah, because I understand how people think. For teaching him – it was a visual
    way of teaching him. I was trying to explain to him tables and databases, and
    how to do the connections between the models, and aggregation works – how to imagine
    that it's kind of collapsing when you have a window function.
  sec: 574
  time: '9:34'
  who: Irina
- line: That's the most difficult concept. I'm still struggling with that one.
  sec: 593
  time: '9:53'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Community Teaching: NGOs, bootcamps, and FrauenLoop volunteer work'
- line: I drew. I like to go and then explain like, “If you do this, this is what
    happens.” Some people are not necessarily visual, so you have to find other ways.
    It is so interesting to understand them – how they understand the problem so that
    you can explain to them in a medium that is best for them. Some people like to
    study alone and work with you. This is kind of where it all started. Within Google,
    I was part of the official mentoring areas, as in like the Anita Borg Scholarship
    recipients from Eastern Europe, groups where we had, again, a really cool project,
    and Winning Ladies – they have actually created two NGOs that I've also volunteered
    for from time to time.
  sec: 597
  time: '9:57'
  who: Irina
- line: In the US, because it was easy due to the language to mentor, I’ve also worked
    with kids, and I worked with soon-to-be veterans going towards data, I’ve taught
    kids to code with Blockly and all the logic loops. Coming back to Europe, I discovered
    the Berlin Mentoring Club, which I thought was great. Both for me as a mentor
    and sometimes I also need advice, so I find people to help me there as well. That's
    when I'm focused more on teaching you how to be a data analyst – how to enter
    the data field. Of course, women prefer women, and there are not many women in
    data that are mentors. So it's a lot of requests.
  sec: 597
  time: '9:57'
  who: Irina
- line: Then I got into the bootcamps in Berlin, and I started analyzing the market
    a little bit, because I hired some analysts from two different schools and I saw
    some patterns. They learn this beautiful code, and they learn modeling, but they
    don't know some of the business – the gut feeling in business. So that's how I
    looked in, analyzed that part, and discovered FrauenLoop. And I'm absolutely in
    love with their community, because it's so positive. Also the fact that it's not
    for profit allows a different… more flexibility – more freedom in the curriculum,
    more tips, more stories from my own experience when somebody needs extra help.
    In the summer, I also designed the curriculum together with a couple of people
    at AI Guild, and put fraud detection and chargeback as well as a fancy class.
  sec: 597
  time: '9:57'
  who: Irina
- line: That's actually one of the questions I have about that. In your LinkedIn,
    you have this experience with the AI Guild that you mentioned. The title that
    you have for this job is Program Manager. The responsibilities, according to your
    profile, is designing the FinTech data science curriculum, collecting market standard
    practices, datasets, and exercises per topic, and finding teachers. I got really
    curious because in DataTalks.Club we also do courses and this is something I also
    need to do often. So I really wanted to ask him more about this.
  sec: 754
  time: '12:34'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Curriculum Design for FinTech: AI Guild program planning and certification
    integration'
- line: Right. My employer was AI Guild with Daniel and Chris – if you don’t know,
    it's a small community and we know each other. First I think I was asked to be
    a teacher and I said, I had a lot of ideas about the program itself and how one
    can update the curriculum a little bit to make it a bit more modern. And that's
    how I got to work together with Daniel.
  sec: 798
  time: '13:18'
  who: Irina
- line: Then I got inspired, “Maybe we should have some Google certification, cloud
    certifications. If we work in BigQuery and do anything data-related, we might
    as well get some certifications for those students.” So I pinged my connections
    with Google and got access to a learning platform, where if you are a Google customer,
    you can have access to it. So now, on top of everything, the students also get
    certification. So I think that's pretty unique in that sense. What are the questions
    you have around that?
  sec: 798
  time: '13:18'
  who: Irina
- line: The question I had was – you actually didn't answer that yet. You said that
    the AI Guild asked you to join them as a teacher, but you were more interested
    in updating the curriculum.
  sec: 861
  time: '14:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: They wanted to create a master class. I did both in the end.
  sec: 875
  time: '14:35'
  who: Irina
- line: Oh, you did both. Okay. I'm really curious, what does it mean to design a
    curriculum? What did you do there?
  sec: 877
  time: '14:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. This I didn't do alone – it was also with Daniel – credit where credit
    is due.
  sec: 887
  time: '14:47'
  who: Irina
- line: So “you” plural, I guess. [chuckles]
  sec: 893
  time: '14:53'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Curriculum Components: fraud, chargeback, ML in production, and business
    skills'
- line: We…first of all, “I” work here, I was interviewing financial techies, so managers
    of data in FinTech companies, or in FinTech departments, or in fraud departments
    – what kind of methodologies they have implemented in their teams. This is an
    exhaustive list – I came up with a list like, money laundering, identity theft,
    identity management, and so on and so forth. Then I audited some Coursera classes
    to see what fraud classes they have, because there are classes on fraud – massive,
    massive classes, it could be a semester – but just to glean a couple of concepts
    from them.
  sec: 896
  time: '14:56'
  who: Irina
- line: What I decided specifically – the curriculum was fintech. After getting the
    high level topics, we decided to spend a couple of days on each topic, find the
    datasets to support it, think about complexity, try ourselves to actually – we
    coded the problems ourselves before putting out the curriculum, because “What
    if it's too hard?” As a manager, I need to understand the internships. I have
    to walk that path. For this curriculum, it was a company that wanted to have it
    – to hire these people. And we thought, “Well, since the company is paying for
    this pilot, we could have also added cloud certification on top, or added a little
    bit of business knowledge or notes related to why we are doing these types of
    models with lots of examples. What does it mean in commerce? What does it mean
    on dating? What does it mean in SaaS?” And so on.
  sec: 896
  time: '14:56'
  who: Irina
- line: 'Thinking about technical skills related to ML in production could be some
    parts of the curriculum and then alternated with the data science part. We also
    thought that it would probably be really good to give the students more business
    understanding skills. This is something that is so forgotten in our data-driven
    world – data analysts need soft skills: presentation skills, storytelling, slide
    design, all of that.'
  sec: 896
  time: '14:56'
  who: Irina
- line: Design? Even that?
  sec: 1053
  time: '17:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: You know what? I think at the end of the day, all of us, even if we are techies,
    we're also salespeople. We sell and we negotiate in every single interaction.
    We need to do that better in our tech world. In my Master's at Max Planck, I had
    a female coordinator (the program coordinator) who taught us technical writing
    and soft skills as well.
  sec: 1056
  time: '17:36'
  who: Irina
- line: She used to film us, she used to tell us (actually, this was part of the pitch
    to get a PhD) “Tell the topic of your thesis in an elevator pitch. If you can
    convince me, then you get it.” [laughs] Then you get to film yourself, to see
    your body language – What does your face look like? Do you look at the audience?
    Do you not? Do you time yourself? We thought it would be a really cool idea to
    bring that.
  sec: 1056
  time: '17:36'
  who: Irina
- header: 'Instructor Sourcing & Storytelling: finding teachers and teaching data
    storytelling'
- line: You did this with the AI Guild as well, for the course. Did you?
  sec: 1107
  time: '18:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I found somebody through – yeah.
  sec: 1112
  time: '18:32'
  who: Irina
- line: That's cool.
  sec: 1117
  time: '18:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was finding teachers – who could teach? Also, the Max Planck network has
    all of these AI teachers, Hasso Plattner, you can also ask them if they're available,
    they also have teaching industry classes. If you look at data storytelling and
    what kind of consultants offer your services on that – there are not very many.
    There are very few people.
  sec: 1118
  time: '18:38'
  who: Irina
- line: I think the most prominent of them was one in the Netherlands, and a couple
    of them in the US, but not here in Germany. So that's why it's really hard to
    find teachers for that. The students said that they liked the class very much.
    They never expected to get such training.
  sec: 1118
  time: '18:38'
  who: Irina
- line: I guess it's not what you expect from a data analytics course by default –
    or any data course. You expect technical skills. You don’t expect to learn how
    to design a slide. It's important, of course.
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Of course. How do you pitch your idea? How do you convince people? And the
    cloud part was an idea. I follow this guy from Microsoft – he designs ML exercises,
    writes ML books, and is very active. He was commenting on how current universities
    are a little bit behind on technology and that you're not going to find a class
    in cloud in a specific university (I don't know, MIT  maybe. Maybe you can at
    MIT, so Stanford? I don't know.)
  sec: 1175
  time: '19:35'
  who: Irina
- line: But in general, you don't find the practices of the real world being taught
    in universities. I think he posted something about an American bootcamp that said,
    like, “We have the trifecta – cloud, data science, and ML in production.” I was
    like, “Yep, that's where we want to go.”
  sec: 1175
  time: '19:35'
  who: Irina
- line: Well, I guess if you're at MIT and you need to design a course, it will take
    a couple of years and then by the time you do this, AWS or Google Cloud are already
    different. Maybe they don't have the services that they used to have two years
    ago and they have something else. Then it means you need to redo the whole thing.
  sec: 1234
  time: '20:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: And the UI has changed or the place where the information is. Yes.
  sec: 1255
  time: '20:55'
  who: Irina
- line: That's why I guess the universities (like more “classical” universities) are
    always behind with these things.
  sec: 1259
  time: '20:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Because they're more reactive. They catch up to the market. How do you convince
    somebody who can teach you those things? Or for a university it might be expensive
    to come and teach those things. Maybe.
  sec: 1266
  time: '21:06'
  who: Irina
- line: So your role as a program manager was to design a curriculum. And what that
    means is, coming up with a course plan, right? What are the modules? What are
    the units there?
  sec: 1279
  time: '21:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: What are the topics underneath? What datasets could we have? What could we
    use as an exercise? So you have insurance, that means you have scoring. How do
    you do scoring? How do you find the data? Kaggle is amazing. God bless Kaggle.
    [laughs] There’s a lot of very good data.
  sec: 1294
  time: '21:34'
  who: Irina
- line: So first, you talked to managers from different fintech companies who work
    with data, you collected some ideas from them to form the curriculum – a list
    of topics you need to cover – then you understood what exactly you need to cover
    there, what kind of datasets you could use, and then you found teachers for each
    of their modules. That's the process. Did you teach anything yourself in any of
    these modules?
  sec: 1308
  time: '21:48'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Fraud Detection & Chargeback Modeling: rule-based vs neural approaches
    in FinTech'
- line: Yeah – fraud, and chargeback. Fraud detection as a rule-based was one example.
    And the other was neural networks for chargeback protection. I was trying to explain
    to the students that for fraud, you have a lot of signals and that's why you can
    use something else. You can even use rule-based – you have a lot of information.
    We can also discuss fraud changes. Fraud methodologies change every day, so if
    you have an ML model, we have to train it every week. That's another kettle of
    fish. On chargeback, you don't have as much information.
  sec: 1334
  time: '22:14'
  who: Irina
- line: There were conversations with the students like “Think. How does it happen?
    What is the process? How many signals? How many signals does e-commerce see? How
    many signals do the bank applications see? Well, then if you don't have signals,
    and you didn't get anything that triggers it that’s within your power or your
    tracking, then yeah – neural networks. Because I don’t know where else to go.”
    I'm sure there are other models as well that could do better. Of course, we're
    not only talking about datasets, but how do you create your feature vectors? What
    are common standard practices to create that? From experience? From theory?
  sec: 1334
  time: '22:14'
  who: Irina
- line: It was more data science, then.
  sec: 1411
  time: '23:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I taught data science. BigQuery and data science.
  sec: 1413
  time: '23:33'
  who: Irina
- line: Sometimes the lines between what data analytics and what data science are
    – the lines are a bit blurry.
  sec: 1416
  time: '23:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m happy to differentiate those definitions, because I was also teaching
    them a little bit.
  sec: 1425
  time: '23:45'
  who: Irina
- line: But what you described, to me, sounds like data science – application of machine
    learning to a particular domain.
  sec: 1427
  time: '23:47'
  who: Alexey

    on fraud and the categories for it. But that's not a direct view of how it is
    actually used in industry. If you have friends in industry, invite them for a

    to do and what the standards are.

    dense. We can talk about each of these words or phrases for the entire interview,
    I guess. [chuckles] That's quite interesting. So you worked as a data analyst,

    much. What I feel is that I can support the community in many ways, but I'm also
    being very mindful of my own energy as well. So for example, if I started a new
    job, I'm not going to teach in the first month or two, because it's too much.
    It's overwhelming. I will not be a full-time teacher, because I really love building
    things. I really like the idea of business and moving the needle and how engaging
    it is. I like the friction in a normal management job and teaching people there
    as well.
  sec: 1543
  time: '25:43'
  who: Irina
- line: I also can say that sometimes I'm so positively surprised by the mentees or
    the students that I'm teaching (that might be even better than my own team) of
    one-two analysts. It's fascinating to see just how different the personalities
    are and the different speeds of desire to acquire new knowledge. I can explain
    that as well, like FrauenLoop, I started as well this year – first as a more of
    an SQL teacher, but we also looked into how we could update the curriculum with
    a few more modern concepts. For example, I had students or I had analysts reporting
    to me coming out of bootcamp, they didn't know what cohort analysis was, or churn,
    or retention – so the business KPIs.
  sec: 1543
  time: '25:43'
  who: Irina
- line: I would also do that at FrauenLoop. And then, because you're an NGO, it's
    really hard to own tech – a tech stack on which you can teach. And I offered the
    opportunity to some of the students, if they want to, to work in my cloud instance
    for FrauenLoop, on my datasets. They can practice whenever they want their SQL
    or other things, or some BigQuery ML. So why not? You can write it directly in
    BigQuery. So yeah, I kind of also brought FrauenLoop. [laughs] People get scared
    of it, like, “Oh, my God. It must be something so big and complex (Google Cloud
    or any other cloud solution).” Then you show them that, actually, it’s really
    not. I'm only showing one part which is easy. I’m not going to complexify things.
  sec: 1543

    than some of the other clouds. I mean, I use AWS at work.

    there. You kind of know how to find stuff, which is rare. [laughs] I mean, not
    everything. But sometimes, some things are a bit easier there. I also see that
    in students this… I don't know if “fear” is the right word.

    but – all of AWS, all of Google Cloud. There is one piece of that that you just
    can focus on and that's enough. Like BigQuery, right?
  sec: 1734
  time: '28:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: At the beginning of the year, I was doing a Greenfield assignment. I learned
    from scratch and built a data warehouse from scratch. I mean, as long as the data
    sources are pretty simple, and you don't have a complex data ecosystem, heck,
    it's very easy to build pipelines, really. It's not rocket science. That was also
    really cool. I like building things. I don't think I could do just one job. I
    need to have a mix of things that always kind of excite me and bring new ideas.

    you need to get into analytics – if you manage data engineers, you need to go
    to get into pipeline building and engineering. And then if you manage both, you
    kind of need to get into both, right?
  sec: 1791

  sec: 1823

    I think one day I read about him in the news. I cannot understand everything he
    does. I read a little bit, but I feel like I'm behind in some areas. That doesn't
    mean that it makes you a better or worse manager. If you conceptually understand
    things… if you conceptually understand an A/B test and how to do it, you're not
    going to do the distribution of the results as well. [chuckles] But again, to
    each their own. Yeah, you need to – because otherwise you cannot, especially with
    engineers, and especially as a woman, I feel that I need to prove that I’m technically
    savvy, maybe more than usual. That's my own [uncompleted]
  sec: 1825
  time: '30:25'
  who: Irina
- line: You mentioned one thing – you were working with somebody who didn't know what
    cohort analytics is or what churn is. I'm really wondering – I must admit, I also
    don't know what exactly cohort analytics is, maybe you can give it in a nutshell?
  sec: 1878
  time: '31:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s super visual. Imagine that you… Let's talk about a game – online gaming
    – Pokemon, Diablo, etc. I play Diablo. I love Diablo. [chuckles]
  sec: 1895

  sec: 1908

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Cohort Analysis Explained: retention metrics, product analytics visualization'
- line: The first and second I've exhausted them to the end together with my brother
    in the private LAN in our block of flats in Romania. But now I'm playing the immortal
    – the online version. Good memories. But imagine that you're launching a game
    and you know that there are parts of the game that are in different sets of beta,
    or maybe you don't have as many journeys. And depending on what users find in
    that game, they're more or less active – if they find the things interesting.
    So actually, as a product manager of a game, or owner of a game, what you want
    is that your users spend as much time on your platform as possible. You're interested
    that they return, and that they return after the first month and second month,
    and you want a long relationship with that client. I'm trying to explain how the
    cohort analysis will look.
  sec: 1910
  time: '31:50'
  who: Irina
- line: Imagine that in the first month of launch, you have people being super active
    because it just launched and everyone wants to try it and the servers are super
    busy. The engineers are focused on that and not on new maps and new challenges.
    As a result, let's say that after the initial hype of two, three months, they
    don't return because there's not enough complexity in the game. Now, the PM says,
    “Well, now I have more time to think about what extra things I can bring into
    the game. Let's make it longer. Let's make it more complex. Let’s make it more
    social, with more challenges.” The next set of users that sign up and start playing
    the game have a different experience than the first ones. As a result, they have
    different behaviors. And as a result, they have a different way of coming back.
    Or they come back for things that the first group did not come back for. So what
    you do is count the users who joined in the first month and then the second month.
    And then you calculate what percentage of that first group returns the second,
    fourth, and so on. If you do it with a very nice visual, you will see a gradation
    of color and how that retention cohort analysis looks – the retention rates.
  sec: 1910

  who: Alexey

  sec: 2047
  time: '34:07'
  who: Irina

    clusters of users and you have different profiles – different personas.
  sec: 2048
  time: '34:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can also do that. You can use it for the same month, different users –
    like an A/B test. You want to see if the test is impacting something. Or maybe
    you have users who see or engage with ads to get credits. And users who play should
    know that – users like me. [chuckles]
  sec: 2057
  time: '34:17'
  who: Irina
- line: You can also create two cohorts and look at, let's say, not at the retention
    rate, but maybe the monetization rate or something else related to that behavior
    – being exposed to something. It can be chronological like month after month after
    month, or it can be at the same time and more like group comparison – persona
    comparison.
  sec: 2057
  time: '34:17'
  who: Irina

    you mentored your brother and that you liked it. But how did you start doing this
    more formally? You also did this with the AI Guild. You were doing this with FrauenLoop.
    How did you find these companies? How did you start mentoring with them? How did
    it happen to you?

    Come teach for us?”

    your stuff and then they reached out.'
  sec: 2148

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think they were reaching out to data specialists who were working
    in FinTech at the time, or had long, extensive experience of marketing data –
    all sorts of data. I told Chris, “Hey I actually have more time than just this,
    if you want. We could build more.” That worked. With FrauenLoop, I kept hearing
    about the NG from so many people. And then one of my hires in January of this
    year was a graduate of FrauenLoop. She kept saying so many good things about it
    that I decided to join, like, “Hey. Can I offer you my services as a mentor or
    teacher? I would love to. I have some extra time if you need that.” Apparently,
    I came at the right time because there was a need for mentors. So I started right
    away.
  sec: 2157
  time: '35:57'
  who: Irina
- line: I think this is something that for your gender is harder to understand. I've
    been in conferences where there are only women – I’ve been in classes where there
    are only women. It has a different vibe. It's a bit more jolly. It's a bit more
    relaxed. It's really nice. You can discuss more honestly, as well, like “Hey,
    you are selling yourself short. You have apologized for some things 10 times and
    I'm going to put an apology jar – I'm going to make you buy coffee or chocolate.
    Because you don't need to apologize this much. This is not a reason to apologize.
    This is just tech work.” So it allows for more connection and more honest conversations
    as well, like “Don't do that. Don't do that when you interview. Trust me. That
    not It's not how you should approach things.” Yeah. And I hope for a long collaboration
    with FrauenLoop. We're always thinking of things.

    insights'
- line: Yeah, they're not. The signatures are official. But I would like to keep things
    under wraps just a bit longer until we get the first [inaudible]. But it's not
    some crazy new idea at all. It’s all about the data engineering question, because
    I've been thinking about grabbing LinkedIn data or Glass Door data, and analyzing
    it to see if I find things. As a data engineer, I was looking into how I can get
    this data and what are the right things – I need a developer account, I need to
    pay for this, I need to have IPs to scrape things. So it took a long time to find
    efficient solutions. I mean, I'm a data manager and I'm a data teacher. There's
    also the concept of data governance and legalities.
  sec: 2329
  time: '38:49'
  who: Irina
- line: For research, you cannot use information that is not publicly available or
    you have manipulated to get. This also was a problem to overcome. Otherwise everyone
    can say “I’ve developed something.” It has to be respectful and legal as well.
    I mean, I would love to do research on par with lean and stuff. I would really
    like that because I think there are so many pitfalls and we don't know, as women,
    every time we take a job, whether we're gonna work in a team with other women
    or not. Maybe we're going to be the only woman in the team. Sometimes being the
    only woman in the team is not easy. Hopefully, with such work, we can see what
    companies are open to diversity, and that diversity is not at the lower level,
    only at the higher level, which shows you that, “I have a model there who can
    stand up for me.”

    can we attract more females, more students, to join the course? The marketing
    we did so far was just some posts on Reddit, some posts on Twitter, LinkedIn and
    people come. That's pretty much the extent.

  who: Alexey
- line: That’s okay. Happens all the time. There are these great organizations, like
    CorrelAid, Citizens for Europe – they also offer classes. Maybe you can offer
    classes through the volunteers so that they can upskill. I've been to a couple
    of hackathons where we have a hard time on the data engineering part, not from
    the statistical point of view. There were very few people with data engineering
    experience. I can think of Ellen Konig, who was the only female and the only data
    engineer expert in the room. So it can be training volunteers, going to school
    things and hackathons.
  sec: 2609
  time: '43:29'
  who: Irina
- line: Also, these organizations, as far as I've seen, have a slightly equal representation
    of genders, surprisingly. I saw men hacking for diversity at CorrelAid, which
    is cool. Women have a bit of a different obstacle than guys, in terms of who your
    target audience is. Do you want to target the moms? It’s the hardest for moms
    to find time to learn something, so you have to do classes in the evening. If
    you want to target PhD students, then you can advertise this class through alumni
    or Max Planck or programs or… I'm sure for example, it can be complementary to
    refugees, as well. This could also be things to pair. Just let me know.

    processes'
- line: If you come up with great ideas, please do share them with me. But I realized
    that we have six questions in Slido and we should cover them too. [Irina agrees].
    The first question – the most important one – is, “How can I get technical feedback
    on my deliverables at work? My manager either doesn't have the technical skills
    or the time for code review or discussing data modeling.”
  sec: 2724
  time: '45:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. I would say, in that case, you have to make your manager aware that
    both your work quality and happiness would benefit from this. And if the team
    doesn't have implemented processes for code reviews, or ticket reviews… [cross-talk]
  sec: 2750
  time: '45:50'
  who: Irina
- line: Would you just say it like that? “My happiness depends on feedback.” Would
    you be upfront about that without trying to say it in any other way?
  sec: 2767
  time: '46:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I’m giving large advice. The first thing I would do if somebody is very sad
    about this and really wants to have code reviews is find things internally. Don't
    escalate, God forbid. You don't need to for this. The purpose of getting technical
    feedback or reviews of ML models is very vital for the company. So yes, somebody
    should take a look at your code. As your manager, I would not let your code go
    live without somebody else seeing it, because it's important.
  sec: 2776
  time: '46:16'
  who: Irina
- line: If you do not have peers in the analytics team, there can be peers in the
    engineering team that can give you feedback on the engineering part of the work.
    Or there can be a financial analyst who can give you some feedback on the logic
    that you have approached. If you are lucky and work for a stakeholder who is technical,
    they can also maybe replicate the work, or the stakeholder could be the reviewer
    as well. For example, the ML engineer cannot go with a code review to an analyst,
    they still need to go to another engineer for that setup.
  sec: 2776
  time: '46:16'
  who: Irina
- line: So I highly encourage that, first of all, that you convince the managers –
    something that they can be solving by themselves. Find the right person, talk
    to more people. Engineers love to help with these things. I don't have any other
    experience. This will be appreciated and any flexibility around these approaches
    will also be appreciated. If you don't find any resources within your company,
    then it's tougher. Because ML models or other information can be very proprietary
    to the company and you cannot share outside – please don't. But then you can find
    other data and kind of have a similar approach and kind of have similar code,
    but please don't share it because people get fired if they do. Don't share company
    code on Reddit. Just code it again and ask the community that you're part of.

  who: Irina
- line: Speaking of discussing data modeling, I guess in situations when your manager
    doesn't have the skills, then it's tricky. But maybe some other people do have
    time. For example, in our company, when somebody wants to discuss data modeling
    or architecture or something and they come to me, I'm super happy. I will be glad
    to put everything I work on.
  sec: 2910
  time: '48:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe I won’t help right there on the spot, but I will wrap up for the day,
    and then tomorrow I’ll be ready to discuss this thing. Because it's much more
    exciting than what I usually do in my day-to-day work. Data modeling means that
    you're probably starting something new and you need to come up with the right
    model for that or right architecture – right something.
  sec: 2910
  time: '48:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: When somebody starts explaining this to you, like how they approach this knowing
    they have a lightbulb moment – the process of explaining something and taking
    it out of your head and putting it in words or on paper helps you clarify things
    too. Actually, this is one of the benefits of mentoring as well.
  sec: 2960
  time: '49:20'
  who: Irina
- header: 'Learning Antipatterns: ML hype, overengineering, and tool-centric approaches'
- line: Okay. Another question, “What are the top five overrated things (antipatterns)
    and waste of productivity for people who learn data analytics?”
  sec: 2979
  time: '49:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Don't learn models if you don't apply anything.
  sec: 2991
  time: '49:51'
  who: Irina
- line: By “models” you mean…
  sec: 2994
  time: '49:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Predictive ML. Don't learn ML if you don't have a project for it. This is
    something I see a lot. Also – overengineering, I call it. A little bit of overengineering.
    [pause] I'm trying to kind of bullet point my answers. On one hand there’s too
    much ML hype without being fully aware if that is necessary or that model is applicable
    to the data.
  sec: 2997
  time: '49:57'
  who: Irina
- line: Data analysts don't necessarily need machine learning, right? If you're a
    data scientist, maybe you do need it, because otherwise you will not pass the
    interview. They will ask you about ML. But for data analysts, it’s not a must.
    Is it?
  sec: 3033
  time: '50:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Then some other things can be antipatterns and things that are not
    recommended – overengineering is the second answer. This is something I've learned
    at Google. Ship it. Ship it and iterate. Find the first MVP that works for you
    and then iterate on it. Don't work in a waterfall model, like for a PhD and wait
    for failure after five years. [chuckles] Iterate quickly. If it does good – great.
  sec: 3045
  time: '50:45'
  who: Irina
- line: If it's a model out of the box, if it’s a solution out of the box – and then
    later improve it to something else – great, fine! I've seen this kind of mentality
    in a couple of Dutch companies, where you take a model out of the box, like a
    recommendation system, and say “I can do better.” “Okay, well. First we have this.
    It makes money – and then we build on top.”
  sec: 3045
  time: '50:45'
  who: Irina
- line: I think all the engineers are guilty of that.
  sec: 3093
  time: '51:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm also guilty of that in some parts. I know. I think there's a lot of focus
    on modeling instead of the business. There are low-hanging fruit with low tech
    too. If you think about it.
  sec: 3100
  time: '51:40'
  who: Irina
- line: I guess if you want to get into analytics because you really like these shiny
    things – you might like machine learning, you might like these things – and you're
    saying now that “You know what? Actually, these things are not needed there.”
    Not always, right? Not all the time.
  sec: 3114
  time: '51:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not all the time. Yeah. For example, I built a model that would estimate how
    much money you would lose in the tool AdExchanger if you do not block certain
    categories of keywords. And it was still a little bit like this. I mean, we had
    a lot of data to do the prediction on, but it was not a complex model. It was
    not. I think it was a simple regression or some clustering with something. Super
    light.
  sec: 3134
  time: '52:14'
  who: Irina
- line: That’s still machine learning – regression. [chuckles]
  sec: 3160
  time: '52:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but I don't really consider it that level, right? In the end, you know
    what? It got incorporated into the product. And when they found another analyst
    to build them a better model for that, they could incorporate that one. It’s okay.
    “Best of”. Other hype-ey things are tools. That's why you rarely see me talk about
    tools. Because I think it's like, you learn to fly a plane – it doesn't matter.
    Or you learn to drive a car – it doesn't matter which car, if you know how to
    drive it.
  sec: 3164
  time: '52:44'
  who: Irina
- line: Maybe with planes, it's a little bit different. [chuckles]
  sec: 3203
  time: '53:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I know. That's why I switched to cars as an example.
  sec: 3206
  time: '53:26'
  who: Irina
- line: Maybe bicycles are an even better example. [chuckles]
  sec: 3208
  time: '53:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Tools come and go – the solutions that existed 12 years ago for BI, for ETL,
    and for visualizations are not the same.
  sec: 3212
  time: '53:32'
  who: Irina
- line: I think Microsoft Integration Studio is still there. [cross-talk]
  sec: 3224
  time: '53:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[inaudible]is not, I think. [laughs]'
  sec: 3229
  time: '53:49'
  who: Irina
- line: Yeah. Most of them, I think. Right?
  sec: 3231
  time: '53:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: I used to work with Pentaho, which used to be open source and for free.
  sec: 3233
  time: '53:53'
  who: Irina
- line: Is it still around?
  sec: 3218
  time: '53:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's still around, but it has been rebranded as Sisense.
  sec: 3240
  time: '54:00'
  who: Irina
- line: I think I remember when I studied BI as my Master’s and Pentaho seemed like
    a big thing back then. But when I graduated, nobody seemed to care about that,
    actually. [chuckles]
  sec: 3247
  time: '54:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, that was like one or two years when it was big and it was a tool of
    choice.
  sec: 3261
  time: '54:21'
  who: Irina
- line: Basically, if we talk about all this Pentaho and other ETLs [cross-talk] you
    have a concept (which is ETL) and all these tools, they're kind of secondary,
    right? That's what you're saying?
  sec: 3270
  time: '54:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. I don't see the point of using DBT if I can do my orchestration myself.
  sec: 3280

  who: Irina
- header: 'Career Transition Advice: moving into data science from non-technical roles'
- line: We have a few more questions. You probably have a lot more antipatterns, but
    the next one is interesting. “I am making a career transition for data science.
    The background is in energy sales (GIS) teaching assistant. I was told that I
    won’t become an engineer. Do you have any advice for young women?”
  sec: 3286
  time: '54:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh boy. [laughs] Tell me who told you that. I can come myself [shakes fists]
    [laughs] No such thing. First of all, I would say that this person who chooses
    data science from a bit of a less technical role has a longer road of learning
    to go through than the classic data analyst because you still have to understand
    a little bit on the business end. It's not just the model, it's also the business
    model – how the money is made.
  sec: 3309
  time: '55:09'
  who: Irina
- line: Data scientist – you can totally become a data scientist. Even if, let's say,
    that you have a role in sales at this point, or in finance – these are departments
    where forecasting is used, where time series complexity is used. You can start
    small – with smaller things that prove value and add to your portfolio while still
    working in the same domain and you gain knowledge in the other.
  sec: 3309
  time: '55:09'
  who: Irina
- line: In sales, there are so many applications, actually. One of the things is lead
    scoring, right? So who is the most promising lead from the backlog of leads that
    you have, right? [Irina agrees] It doesn't have to be very complex. Maybe simple
    logistic regression.
  sec: 3368
  time: '56:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was looking at how we could better forecast organic registrations for a
    dating app and I was thinking, “Okay, just plain forecasting like they do in Excel
    – this already exists. But that doesn't include things like density, things like
    population age, or the exchange of dollar.” So if you have those time series,
    and you enrich your time series with this, you can have a better forecast. And
    again, this can be done pretty easily by someone in this role. I'm happy to give
    her plenty of ideas to that person as well on how she can do this. She can book
    a session with me, she can email me. Not a problem.
  sec: 3385
  time: '56:25'
  who: Irina
- line: What's your email? Or what's the best way to contact you? I guess it's LinkedIn,
    isn't it?
  sec: 3434
  time: '57:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s LinkedIn. But you can also write first name dot last name, at Gmail.
  sec: 3440
  time: '57:20'
  who: Irina
- line: So it’s Irina.Brudar@gmail.com [Irina agrees]– because you have two first
    names.
  sec: 3446
  time: '57:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. My mom and my grandma couldn't agree, so my dad said, “Why don't you
    choose both?” [laughs]
  sec: 3451
  time: '57:31'
  who: Irina
- line: You usually go by Irina?
  sec: 3459
  time: '57:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Irina, yes.
  sec: 3460
  time: '57:40'
  who: Irina

  sec: 3462
  time: '57:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: No.
  sec: 3464
  time: '57:44'
  who: Irina
- line: Okay. [chuckles] So even though they didn't agree which name to give you,
    at the end you still use Irina more.
  sec: 3465
  time: '57:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: My dad said “I'm Switzerland,” let the women choose. [laughs]
  sec: 3472

  who: Irina

    But you said that you''re not a tool person.'

  who: Alexey

    tracking'

    many people. Yeah.
  sec: 3488
  time: '58:08'
  who: Irina

  sec: 3495
  time: '58:15'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 3500
  time: '58:20'
  who: Irina

  who: Alexey
- line: Data visualization, slides, soft skills, communication. [chuckles]
  sec: 3503
  time: '58:23'
  who: Irina
- line: Since the question is about tools, then I guess for data visualization, you
    need to pick a tool. Does it matter which tool? Just pick one?
  sec: 3510
  time: '58:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: It doesn’t matter which tool. And all of these tools, you can also find Tableau
    for free or they have a public version of it. Play with it and build your portfolio.
    But if you want to go into data analytics, SQL is the bread and butter. If you
    can add some coding on the side, that’s great. But if not, I don't think it's
    really required. I know some analysts have an area of focus, be it data visualization,
    or troubleshooting.
  sec: 3518
  time: '58:38'
  who: Irina
- line: It depends, again, on the business model. If it's an online business model
    of ecommerce, then I highly recommend understanding “How does the page work? How
    does the app work? What is the normal user flow?” Probably understanding a little
    bit about tracking and product analytics is very helpful. Cookies are also. Because
    then you understand how things and data flows through the app itself in order
    to come to your database. And if you understand that, it's easier to work.
  sec: 3518
  time: '58:38'

  sec: 3585
  time: '59:45'
  who: Irina
- line: Pick any. I see that there are a few comments, so I want to mention them because
    they're interesting before we wrap up. One of the comments is “I was one of the
    few women doing the DataTalks.Club Zoomcamp. It was hard being one of the few.
    So the suggestion is join the effort with women who code and other women's organizations
    like Women in Data Science.” Thanks a lot. Great suggestion. I will, definitely.
    I am in touch with some of them. So we’ll definitely talk.
  sec: 3586
