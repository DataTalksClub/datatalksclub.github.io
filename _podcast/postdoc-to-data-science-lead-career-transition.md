description: 'Learn a one-year roadmap from postdoc to data science lead: machine learning foundations, Docker deployment, resume and hiring tips to land jobs.'
intro: 'How do you go from a postdoc to a data science lead while mastering machine learning foundations and deployment? In this episode, CJ Jenkins — a PhD-turned-data science lead working on credit risk modeling, with published research and a textbook used in academia — walks through that transition. We trace CJ’s roots in evolutionary biology and genomics, the statistical ML foundations (GLMs, population dynamics), and practical tools like Bash, R, Python, and SQL. Key topics include Docker deployment and bridging the gap between research and production, hiring signals and interview assessment techniques that prioritize learning agility and humility, and concrete career tactics: a one-year Coursera sprint (Johns Hopkins, Andrew Ng), resume rewrites (14 CV iterations), LinkedIn keyword strategy, and selective application versus volume. CJ also discusses location and networking strategies (Berlin, Stockholm, Klarna onboarding), technical expectations for juniors, code quality, and building psychological safety on teams. Listen to learn actionable steps for skills-first resumes, interview preparation, deployment basics, and how to translate academic output into industry impact.

- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: 'Career Journey: Postdoc to Data Science Lead'
- line: This week we'll talk about moving from academia to industry. We have a special
    guest today, CJ. CJ worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Martin Luther University,
    which is a university in Germany and then she decided to move into data science.
    Since 2018, she has been working as a data scientist and now she is a data science
    lead. Welcome, CJ. Let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your
    career journey so far?
  sec: 58
  time: 0:58
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Evolutionary Biology: Statistics & Population Dynamics'
- line: Yeah. I was an evolutionary biologist for a long time. I did my undergraduate
    Master's and PhD in evolutionary biology. Then, about six months before I finished
    my PhD, I was thinking “I'm not sure I want to stay in academia.” But that’s not
    the time to make life-changing decisions, so I just put my head down, finished
    up, and I was like, “I can figure this out during my postdoc.” Then about a year
    and a half into a three year postdoc, I was like, “I don't think I want to do
    this anymore.” So I shifted gears, studied a bunch, and got an awesome job in
    industry in Berlin. I've been a data scientist ever since.
  sec: 88
  time: '1:28'
  who: CJ
- line: What’s evolutionary biology?
  sec: 128
  time: '2:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Very good question. It looks at how populations of organisms evolve over time.
    When people see ‘evolutionary biology’ they're like, “And then you ended up in
    technology?” and I’m like, “Hear me out.” Because evolution happens to a population
    instead of an individual, so it's rooted a lot in statistics. I think that was
    one of my edges in getting my first data science job, is that I knew more about
    statistics than anybody else in the room. I've been building experiments, running
    statistics on the data and collecting it. I was teaching my students how to do
    statistics, so – teaching statistics within the courses. So I had a really solid
    foundation. But on top of that, because evolution looks at how populations change
    over time, it's really rooted solidly in math and differential equations, and
    looking at how population dynamics can change. So it's literally just looking
    at how populations evolve. But it gave me a really strong background for things
    that I ended up using in data science.
  sec: 131
  time: '2:11'
  who: CJ
- header: 'Academic Research as Data Science Practice: Genomics & Bash'
- line: To prepare for this interview, I was going through your LinkedIn profile.
    I actually got the impression that you were also doing data science stuff back
    when you were in academia.
  sec: 196
  time: '3:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Depends on how you define ‘data science stuff’, because I think that's an
    interesting question.
  sec: 213
  time: '3:33'
  who: CJ
- line: 'I have a quote. It says you were doing these things: “manipulating big datasets,
    analysis of A/B tests, working in environments of large and complex data structures,
    commonly applied advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.” Yeah,
    so this sounds like a usual data science job.'
  sec: 216
  time: '3:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Absolutely. You know, it's funny, because I still rely on a lot of those
    tools. A lot of genomic data is unstructured text files full of sequence reads
    that are three to four gigabytes each. Figuring out how to process those in bash
    requires a certain programming knowledge. But the things that I was missing were
    the deployment component. I had to Google what an API was when I first started
    as a data scientist, and I had to figure out what an infrastructure was, what
    a Docker container was, and all those things. So I had the theoretical understanding,
    and the backing, and a lot of the coding done. But you can ask anybody at my first
    job – during my first three months, I just like walked around with this look of
    terror like, “I have no idea what I'm doing!” [laughs] But I figured it out. Yeah.
  sec: 240
  time: '4:00'
  who: CJ
- header: 'Statistical Machine Learning: GLMs and Foundations'
- line: Did you need to learn any machine learning or you basically knew everything
    you needed?
  sec: 285
  time: '4:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, no. I had to learn a lot of machine learning. Most of the background I
    had in machine learning was very much based on statistical models. I took my first
    machine learning course, and everybody was talking about how it’s the best, like
    “Machine learning! Machine learning!” And then I looked at it and I was like,
    “The first ones you guys talk about is linear regression and logistic regression.
    Those are just statistical methods that I've been using for years.” Actually,
    my first case study for my first job was – we were supposed to build a predictive
    model so that we could predict transactions of individuals. And I sort of cheated
    because the data was too sparse. So I just made a proof of concept by combining
    the data and then predicting the mean. But I use a generalized linear model. It
    was just a GLM that was tied to a Poisson distribution, I think. I can't remember
    the exact distribution I used, but it was just a statistical model.
  sec: 290
  time: '4:50'
  who: CJ
- line: So basically, for you, the theoretical part of data science, or the theoretical
    part of machine learning, wasn’t scary. You could just watch a course and then
    apply everything you learned and quickly grasp all these things. In that sense,
    the background you had as a researcher helped you a lot.
  sec: 349
  time: '5:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Yeah.
  sec: 368
  time: '6:08'
  who: CJ
- header: 'Bridging Gaps: Deployment, Docker, and Python Learning'
- line: Then for the things you didn't know – you mentioned you didn't know anything
    about deployment, you didn't know what API is, Docker, and all this stuff. Yep.
    Did you have to learn this on the job? It wasn’t before getting the job, right?
  sec: 370
  time: '6:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. I feel like I got really lucky. It's one of those things, like I said,
    and I get asked this a lot from academics, “How do I move into industry?” The
    unfortunate truth is that I got really lucky with time and place. I moved there
    at a good time, whereas I think the field is really competitive now. They also
    talked about this a lot at N26, which was my first job. They came back from my
    interview and just looked at everybody else in the team and they were like, “She
    said everything you're not supposed to say in an interview.” But I was very open
    with them. I was like, “Here's a list of things that I'm bad at. But I really
    want to learn from you guys. I don't know everything, but I want to learn.”
  sec: 385
  time: '6:25'
  who: CJ
- line: But one of those was that I didn't know Python when I started. I had to learn
    that on the job. If I'm being totally honest, I didn't know exactly what a position
    in data science was going to look like. My sister was asking me ahead of time,
    “So, what are you going to do?” And I was like, “You know, manipulate data… use
    data to gain insights. Make data into value.” And she was like, “Yeah, none of
    those mean anything.” And I was like “I know.” Until I started the job, I wasn't
    sure what that was gonna be. It was a hard crash course. But I think there were
    a couple things that helped me succeed and a couple of them came from academia.
  sec: 385
  time: '6:25'
  who: CJ
- line: One thing in academia is that you need to be able to teach yourself stuff.
    At that point, I had 14 years experience teaching myself how to do things and
    teaching myself how to learn things. So I did a lot of that. I think one of my
    colleagues is listening, so they can attest to this – everybody else at the company
    started at 10. The core hours were 10 to 6. And I was usually in the office between
    6 and 7 and I spent those hours – between whenever I got in and 10, 10:30, when
    our team did our stand up – just learning new things. Everyone was like, “You
    know that you don't need to be in here this early?” And I was like, “You know
    I don't actually know what I'm doing yet, right?” I spent a lot of time figuring
    it out back then.
  sec: 385
  time: '6:25'
  who: CJ
- line: I also had incredible colleagues who were willing to sit down and do a lot
    of pair programming with me, which is still my favorite tool with new people –
    just to sit down and have two people working together to solve the problem. Then
    I could see how to solve the problems by myself. But yeah – I didn't know any
    of that when I started.
  sec: 385
  time: '6:25'
  who: CJ
- header: 'Hiring Signals: Smartness, Ambition, and Receptiveness to Feedback'
- line: That's cool. I'm just trying to think – some people are listening to this
    and they're thinking, “Okay, now I also have this theoretical foundation. I know
    statistics well. I know machine learning well. But how can I convince a potential
    employer that they should hire me and then I learn everything on the job?” Let's
    say, if you don't know Python, if you don't know deployment, you don't know API?
    All you know well is statistics and machine learning. So how do you convince an
    employer to hire you? How do you convince them that you will learn everything
    in, let's say, three months, and you'll be able to start being useful?
  sec: 521
  time: '8:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a very good question. Again, I think I got really lucky. But from the
    other side now. Now I'm leading and building a data team, so I can speak to what
    I look for in people who might not have a lot of experience. I am specifically
    going to be hiring two new junior people in the spring. But what I'm looking for
    is three things. That they're reasonably smart – they can pick up on concepts
    quickly. That they have the ambition to learn – they're open to learning and trying
    new things. And that they can take feedback.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: CJ
- line: If you're not open to learning new things and you're stuck in your way, it's
    going to be a problem. If you get really defensive when I say something like,
    “Hey, maybe you should do this differently.” Then it's going to make it hard.
    But if you have those three things, I don't care what you know. I can teach you
    anything. But if you have those three things – those are the kind of people that
    you want to invest in as a junior.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: CJ
- line: So from the counterpoint, if it was somebody who's like, “How can I get my
    foot in the door?” I think demonstrating those things will work. I don't need
    to see your crazy CV or crazy portfolio, especially for a junior position or an
    entry position. I want to see that you have the ability to pick things up quickly
    and that you can take feedback.
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: CJ
- header: 'Interview Assessment: Testing Learning Agility and Humility'
- line: How do you test for these things during the interview?
  sec: 642
  time: '10:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm brutal. [laughs] No, I'm actually really nice. I think this is one of
    the things that you think a lot about as an academic like, “How do you define
    smart?” This is one of those skills that transfer really well. It’s somebody's
    ability to absorb and synthesize new information – they can figure out what I'm
    telling them and then synthesize it with what they already know. You can just
    ask questions like, “Tell me about a problem that you've worked on.” And then
    I'll start throwing curveballs at them and be like, “Oh, do you mean like this?”
    And then I see how they respond to that.
  sec: 646
  time: '10:46'
  who: CJ
- line: Then, to see if they can take feedback, I just flat out ask them, “Tell me
    about a time when you were wrong.” I think that's a very different question. I
    had somebody answer this the other day. They told me about a time that they had
    failed. I was like, “That's not what I was asking. Tell me about a time when you
    were wrong.” I can give you a list of the ways that I'm wrong. I'm gonna run a
    whole series at one of the universities in Stockholm about ways that machine learning
    algorithms in production fail. But being able to admit, “Hey, I was wrong about
    this, and this is what I wanted to learn from that. Here's how it changed me in
    the future.” That means that you're open to the possibility that you can be wrong,
    and you're open to other people telling you that. I think that's important.
  sec: 646
  time: '10:46'
  who: CJ
- header: 'First Tech Interview: Referral, Case Study in R, and Honesty'
- line: Since you mentioned that you will be hiring juniors soon. I guess many people
    are taking notes right now. [laughs] Yeah, but that's tricky to check for these
    three things. But I guess companies also check their theoretical background and
    how well you know all these things. Do you remember how the interview actually
    looked like for you? Like when you were transitioning – the interview with N26.
  sec: 719
  time: '11:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I remember it very distinctly. I have a good memory. But this one stands
    out in my mind because it was such a weird experience. What was the interview
    process like?  Okay, it was really easy. [laughs] I got so lucky. I had a friend
    in Berlin who had gone on a Tinder date with a guy at N26 and she was still in
    contact with him. So she told me, “CJ, do you need a hook-up?” I applied to four
    positions at the time. Again, luck. I applied to four positions, I had one interview,
    and I got the job. And it was my number one choice. This kind of thing doesn't
    happen anymore. This is not something that happens these days. I got lucky.
  sec: 754
  time: '12:34'
  who: CJ
- line: At N26, I skipped the recruiting step, because I was a referral. They sent
    me a case study and I spent like a solid week working really hard on it. At the
    time, all of the deployments were in Python. But at the time, they said, “You
    can do this in Python or R. We don't care about the programming language. We just
    want to see that you know the concepts.” So I did it in R because that was my
    native language. I sent them this case study. A week later, they contacted me,
    “We’d like to interview you.” I was like, “Okay. Cool.”[swooning] So I sat down
    with the two data scientists at N26 at the time and, like I said, it was an hour
    and a half interview.
  sec: 754
  time: '12:34'
  who: CJ
- line: I was just like, “Here are all the things that I don't know. I'm really excited
    to learn from you guys.” So all the things that you're not supposed to say in
    an interview. But I think they appreciated the honesty and I felt more confident
    from that point forward, because I was like, “They know exactly what they're getting.
    I don't have to have imposter syndrome. They know my failings before I get in
    the door. I don't have to pretend to be something.”
  sec: 754
  time: '12:34'
  who: CJ
- line: Everybody else was like, “Did you fake it till you made it?” I was like, “No,
    absolutely not.” Then after that, it was two weeks and then I had an interview
    with the CDO at the time – chief data officer. I'd studied Python in between.
    I was like, “I have to know Python terms!” He, at one point, literally pulled
    out a computer and was like, “Walk me through what this Python code is doing.”
    I could pick up logically what was happening, but I didn't know any of the syntax.
    So we talked about that and then, two days later I had a job offer.
  sec: 754
  time: '12:34'
  who: CJ
- line: Yeah, that's pretty impressive.
  sec: 899
  time: '14:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it was very easy. It was a lot of luck. But I walked out of the first
    interview – and keep in mind, up to this point, I've had 14 years as an academic,
    so I've spent my whole life in labs and universities – and I walked out of this
    interview in this super-cool tech startup. Everyone was walking around looking
    like cool startup tech people in the office. I got to the sidewalk and I just
    bent over laughing so hard, like “I can't believe this is my life right now. I
    can't believe that this is where I am.” But it was time to leave academia. So
    I guess we're moving forward. Yeah. It was bizarre.
  sec: 901
  time: '15:01'
  who: CJ
- header: 'Transition Timeline: One-Year Plan and Coursera Sprint'
- line: Did it take a lot of time between when the idea occurred to you that you wanted
    to try something else to your actual first day at N26?
  sec: 936
  time: '15:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was about a year – a little over a year. I was in London – which is one
    of my favorite cities in the world – visiting a friend in January. It hit me all
    of a sudden. It had been building up for a while. It was like ‘death by 1000 cuts’
    but that was the final cut where I was just like, “I want to be able to choose
    to live in a city like this someday. If I stay in academia, that's never going

    be able to choose where I want to live. I’m never gonna have enough money to do
    things like this. So it's time to go.” But I looked at my schedule and at that
    point, in January, I had committed to a number of things.

  who: CJ
- line: I committed to teaching that spring, I committed to field season that summer,
    I had a couple of PhD students and Master’s students that I needed to get into
    a good position before I left them. And I had a huge talk that I was invited to
    give at this conference at the end of August. So I was just like, “Okay, I'm gonna
    shelve that idea until August.” I just worked really hard as an academic knowing
    I was going to leave, but continued working really hard until the end of August.
    Then I came back from the conference and completely shifted gears. I rewrote my
    CV, did a Coursera specialization in data science to get a more broad view of
    it. Then I started applying to companies in Berlin in the middle of November.
    I started at N26 in the beginning of February.

    I was reading your LinkedIn – I don't know how many iterations you did there –
    but it sounded like very data science related stuff. So I could see that you were
    already doing all this data science stuff before you were officially doing it.
    Yeah, I guess this is more like a framing question – how do you put all these
    14 years of experience in such a way that people want to hire you?
  sec: 1034

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It was hard. And again, I'm super lucky. I had really good friends who
    were willing to help me. And because I had really good friends who were willing
    to help me and who had been in industry for a while, I am now always, (people
    are gonna contact me now) but I'm always willing to help other people. Random
    people ping me on LinkedIn and are like, “Hey!” And I'm just like, “Yeah, I'll
    look at your CV. Yeah, we can talk through the interview. Yeah, of course. I'm
    happy to do it.” I'm pretty active on the DataTalks career channel, because I
    had help – I couldn’t do this by myself. So I feel like I owe the world help in
    return, because I got really lucky.
  sec: 1067

  who: CJ
- line: So back to the CV, I was like, “Okay, how do we write my CV? It's like six
    pages long. I know nobody's gonna read that in industry.” My friend Penny and
    I did a weekend trip to Italy and she was like, “Bring your computer.” So we're
    in Cinque Terre and she hands me a bottle of wine, takes my computer. She looks
    at my CV, and she highlights all of the talks and all of the publications, and
    then she hits the ‘delete’ button. I was like, “Ow, that really hurts.” And she
    was just, like, “Drink the wine.”[laughs] So I had her to help. I also reached
    out to a couple of female data scientists, and asked them “How do I do this?”
  sec: 1067
  time: '17:47'
  who: CJ
- line: What they said was, “You need to emphasize the skills that you have, and those
    that you've developed in industry, rather than the things that you've done.” So,
    instead of talking about, “This is the research I did during my PhD.” I changed
    it to, “Here are the skills that I learned while doing the research in my PhD.”
    I didn't plagiarize, but I would read other people's stuff and thought to myself
    “That also applies to me.” Or like, “Oh, that's also something that I can put
    on my list.” Then I reformatted it so that the education section was at the bottom
    – it didn’t matter anymore where I went to school or what my degrees were, rather
    what the skills that I picked up while I was doing those were. It was genuinely…
    I had good friends and I was very lucky. A nice bottle of wine helped because
    it hurt [laughs].
  sec: 1067

    least in STEM, right? For example, I know that my mother, who works in ecology,
    needs to process weather data. She does that in Excel. Sometimes she asks me for
    help to process it. But yeah, I can see how you can reframe this, what she's doing,
    in such a way that it sounds like what data scientists do.

- line: How many iterations did it take for your CV? You said that you had a CV that
    was six pages long. You had this bottle of wine and your friend when you were
    doing this. How many times did you need to redo the whole thing before you started
    applying to jobs?
  sec: 1240
  time: '20:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: The whole thing, I don't know. I did about 14 iterations. As I said, I did
    this with my friend, Penny. Then I had two different women in industry who just
    were kind enough to look over my CV. Then I had a few other friends from my cohort
    during my PhD – my friend, Roxy, who had already transitioned into industry. I
    don't want to plug her, but she's doing incredible work and she gave me really
    good feedback. And then I also had my friend Simon, who was also transitioning
    to industry at the same time as me. As a typical academic, I did the first iteration
    and then I sent it out to literally everyone and got all of the feedback. I also
    talked to a couple friends who are recruiters. I was just like, “Hey, can you
    take a look at this and see what's important?”
  sec: 1256
  time: '20:56'
  who: CJ
- line: Because for a lot of it they were like, “Make sure that you have a PDF version
    (not .docx). Make sure that the font is something that's machine readable because
    a lot of people use scanning software to reduce the number of resumes that they
    have to look at.” So that's why those buzzwords are important. I had LinkedIn
    Premium at the time. My friend Jessica was like, “You should pay for LinkedIn
    Premium.” Which is something I almost never do. LinkedIn asked me to pay for premium
    twice a week and I'm like, “No, I'm good.” But at the time, I actually did, because
    it allowed me to see the skills that other people were listing as their skills.
  sec: 1256
  time: '20:56'
  who: CJ
- line: I just sat down and was like, “What are my skills? I don't know. I can't do
    anything.” But when I started looking at what other people were listing as their
    skills, I was like, “Actually, I can do that. I can do that. And I can do that.”
    So this allowed me to build up this word skill set, based on what other people
    had also done, and that I could then attribute to myself.

    lot of the coding things I needed to know, but I think it gave me a good broad
    overview. Because it's 10 classes, right? It gives you a broad view of the field
    and all the different things that you can inspect in data.
  sec: 1384

  who: CJ

    else?
  sec: 1408
  time: '23:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it depends on what you want to go into. I should also mention – I'm
    a bit of a masochist. I didn't have any money. So I looked at it and the prices
    were not per class, but per month. Each one was supposed to be one month, so it
    was like a 10-month class. And I was like, “I can't afford that. I don't have
    that kind of time and money.” So I looked at it and I set myself a schedule where
    I did one course a week. That way, I only had to do it for like two months. There
    was also a four day weekend there, because it was fall break. And so I did it.
    I managed to get all of them done in like two months so I didn't have to pay for
    that much.
  sec: 1415
  time: '23:35'
  who: CJ
- line: But I was really focused at the time and really ambitious. I think it was
    good for where I am now. Because now, I'm leading both data scientists and data
    analysts and data engineers. And at the time, it was really good, because it gave
    me this broad view. But if it was somebody today, I think a lot of the field has
    become a lot more specialized. So I'd ask somebody, like, “What are you interested
    in?” I think everybody should take Andrew Ng's machine learning course. I think
    he does just a fantastic job of explaining things.
  sec: 1415

  who: CJ
- line: This is where I started in machine learning.
  sec: 1488
  time: '24:48'

- line: Exactly. It's really good. I think he does a really good job of explaining
    complex things in a very simple way, which, by the way, is one of the most important
    skills that you need as a data scientist. I think the strongest skill I have from
    academia is being able to explain complex things in a simple way. That’s really
    good to emulate. But I know a lot of people are really into deep learning. I think
    Fast AI has a really great platform for learning deep learning. I think if people
    are more interested in statistics, there's a couple of Bayesian courses that I
    think could be really good. So it depends on what people are interested in now.
    And then I would send them in a different specific direction.

    course marathon. You finished the specialization instead of 10 months, you did
    it in 2. Then you decided to move to Berlin, right? You were in Germany, but you
    weren't in Berlin yet. So you just selected the closest tech hub? Or how did that
    happen?
  sec: 1537
  time: '25:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was almost more organic than that. When I moved from the US, it wasn't
    even on my radar of places I would ever want to live. But living at the university
    in Halle, which is like an hour and a half south, I would have to go to Berlin
    to fly out. Halle has an airport, but it doesn't really fly anywhere. So, I spent
    a lot of time in Berlin and in that year and a half that I was living in Halle,
    I fell in love with Berlin. It wasn't just that it was the closest city, it was
    the place that I wanted to live then. I started looking for jobs in Berlin. But
    I also had, at that point, in my mind a list of places I wanted to be because
    I really liked the product. At that point, I was already an N26 customer and I
    was like, “I think this is a great product.” Especially as a foreigner, being
    able to get a card that works quickly, that you can do fully mobile that…

    Which is not that common.
  sec: 1620
  time: '27:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Not common at all in Germany. I liked the product and there were
    a couple of companies I was looking at. I was talking to GetYourGuide, but I didn't
    have a reference there, so I was a little bit behind. Then there was a data science
    consulting company who gave really good talks in Berlin. They had a whole fantastic
    seminar series. I interviewed with them, but just the initial interview. So it
    was like, “I love travel. GetYourGuide seems cool.” And GetYourGuide’s blog was
    amazing, so I was attracted to them. So I only applied to those two companies.
  sec: 1625

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. It's so funny, because it's so different when I was leaving
    N26 – I did the numbers game, the ‘spray and pray’. But when I was applying for
    my first position, I did all of this research and would read up and look at, “Do
    these people look happy? Does this founder look good?” I told my friend Jessica
    this and she was like, “CJ, it's got to be more like Tinder. You just gotta keep
    swiping. You can't fall in love with the person until they respond. Otherwise,
    you're gonna get heartbroken by somebody who doesn't even know you exist.” That's
    the advice that I give now, but that's definitely not what I did. I was just like,
    “This product is super cool. I want to work with the people who built this.” Then
    I met the people who were there and I was like, “I really feel like I could learn
    from these people.” And I was right. I learned a ton. I had amazing colleagues.
    I got really lucky.

  who: CJ
- header: 'Application Strategy: Selective Research vs. Volume Applications'
- line: Yeah. You keep saying that you were lucky. But if I summarize what you did
    – you did 14 iterations of your CV. You took this long specialization in two months.
    You were also very selective – you selected companies that you knew. For example,
    N26, you already knew the brand. You were a customer and you knew the product.
    Maybe it wasn't just luck in the end?
  sec: 1716

  sec: 1746
  time: '29:06'
  who: CJ
- line: Yeah. At the beginning, you said you just got lucky and that people just helped
    you. But there is more to it than just that. But now your advice would be to apply
    to more companies – not selecting a few. Instead, you take a city and apply to
    all open positions? Or how would you approach it now?
  sec: 1751
  time: '29:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Um, no. I think I would still… I would have increased my numbers. For example,
    after I was leaving N26 – one of my best friends, who is still the head of data
    analytics at N26 – he knew I was applying when I was leaving. I got my first rejection.
    I was like, “Oh, I got rejected.” And he was like, “You're gonna have to get over
    that. You’re gonna be getting a lot of those.” But at that point, I had been so
    selective the first round that I wasn't familiar with this feeling. My little
    sister always says “Find what you love and do it in the evenings and weekends.”
    And I'm never going to be that person. I was like, “I love what I do. And I'm
    passionate about it.”
  sec: 1773
  time: '29:33'
  who: CJ
- line: I'm looking for a space where I can be passionate and invested in what I'm
    doing. Sometimes too invested. Even then, I would go through job ads and be like,
    “Does this look like a cool product? Does this look like a place I could really
    pursue and really be invested in?” But in the second iteration, when I applied
    to like 20 positions, and went through the interview process – I got a lot of
    rejections. But I applied to many more places. I think the market’s a lot more
    competitive now than it was four years ago.

  sec: 1869
  time: '31:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I hate onboarding. But was it difficult to make the move? It was easy to make
    the decision. The Klarna interview process was a lot longer. I had four interviews
    back-to-back. I walked out of each of the rooms for the interview and I was like,
    “I was not the smartest person in that room.” That's a great position to be in
    when you start somewhere new. If you can start in a position where other people
    are teaching you things, then your growth potential is huge. So I was like, “This
    is a company I want to go to.” Because, at the time, there were 36 data scientists
    and data science and machine learning are really embedded in the product. And
    so I was like, “This is a place where I can really learn a lot and learn from
    really cool people.”
  sec: 1874
  time: '31:14'
  who: CJ
- line: But the first two weeks are the same as everywhere, right? Even in my current
    position, in the first two weeks, you go from a place where you know a lot and
    you are comfortable in your space because you know the product and you know the
    company. You know who to ask if you have crop problems. But then you go from that
    to a space where you know nothing. You have to relearn all of those things and
    you have to relearn those connections. You don't even know where to go to get
    the information. The first two weeks at Klarna, it was very much “Ugh. All of
    my friends are at N26. I knew everything there. I was very comfortable. Why did
    I put myself in a position where I'm once again uncomfortable?” So, I hate onboarding.

    Stockholm. She was like, “Okay.” So I started looking for a new position in Stockholm
    and about two weeks into looking for a new position in Stockholm, she was like,
    “I can't afford to lose you. I'm just gonna move you to Stockholm. You can work

    This person works as a postdoc at some university, doing some science. They hear
    that data science is cool, so they think, “Okay, maybe I want to do that.” Of
    course, they want to move to Berlin or some other city. For that person – what
    should they do? How should they approach from where they are now to a company,
    or a startup in Berlin?
  sec: 2028
  time: '33:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That's a very good question. I think the biggest thing you can do is
    things like – try to start engaging with the data science community in Berlin.
    I think it's one of the great things about Berlin – and Stockholm, but very much
    in Berlin – is that it's such a thriving data science community and people across
    different companies are super stoked to talk and work with each other. So the
    first step – or the first piece of advice now would be – go to virtual meetups,
    or go to them in person if you can manage to be in Berlin. Start meeting people,
    start talking to people about their work.
  sec: 2069
  time: '34:29'
  who: CJ
- line: In my experience, because it's such a great data science community, most people
    are super stoked to help. Also everybody's hiring, right? So they’re going to
    be like, “Hey. I heard you are interested in this. Maybe you should apply to this
    one.” Or like, “Hey, I'm looking for people like you. Maybe we should talk more.”
    But I think getting into that community would be the first step, if somebody was
    working as a postdoc and needed to get in there. A remark I've always said is
    that I'm remarkably bad at networking, because I have friends who are like, “You
    gotta work the angles. You gotta meet the people, so they can figure out how they
    could do the things.” And I’m just like, “I'm not that. I want everyone to be
    my friend.” So I tend to talk to a lot of people and I have a lot of people in
    the data science community. But it's never like, “Make sure that everybody's good.”
    It's just like, “Hi! You want to get a beer? I'm CJ.” I think that can take you
    a really long way.

    data science positions most people are looking for the same thing – they’re looking
    for smart people who are willing to learn. Once you start interacting with people
    in the data science community, and it's obvious that you're willing to learn,
    then I think everybody's hiring – especially right now. I think that would be
    a good way. Then once you have your foot in the door the rest is history.

    to start the job are nowadays? What do you need to actually know?
  sec: 2203
  time: '36:43'
  who: Alexey

    have to be better at writing code than I was when I started. I think that's the
    most obvious one. I think the technical test is a lot more arduous, even for really
    junior people. I think learning and understanding what clean code is, and what
    good coding practices are for data science – I think that’s going to be crucial.

- header: 'Skill Building: Pair Programming, LeetCode, and Code Reviews'
- line: I didn't learn how to do that till after I started. But the way that I learned
    how to get better at programming – and I still do this – a data scientist friend
    of mine asked me this today, “How do I get better at writing code?” And I was
    like, “Find somebody who's better than you are and just pair-program with them
    every week.” I have a fantastic colleague that I worked with at both N26 and then
    they followed me to Klarna. They are much better at Python programming than I
    am. They've been doing it since they were little. So I blocked the time on our
    schedule for like a solid year when we were at Klarna for an hour every week.
  sec: 2259
  time: '37:39'
  who: CJ
- line: All of the meetings in my calendar are named bizarre things, but our meeting
    was called ‘stuff and things’. We would meet up and pick one Leetcode problem
    and then we would pair-program for an hour every week. This way I could learn
    how he approached things, and I could learn about algorithm things that I didn't
    know. At that point, my first manager was really strict on clean code and so I
    learned a lot of clean coding practices from that. Peer reviews, like getting
    a good peer review process and learning from how other people would do things.
    I think all of that's really good.
  sec: 2259
  time: '37:39'
  who: CJ
- line: But for me, all that happened after I started in industry. If I was a postdoc,
    the advice I would give is “Find somebody who's better than you are, who you can
    learn from, and really go at that.” But that's also something that's really different
    between academia and industry. One of my colleagues at Klarna was brand new, out
    of academia, and he did a math PhD. He and I had a long conversation about how
    he needs to get better at collaborating. Because in academia when you collaborate,
    it's like, “We're going to do this project together. I'm going to go into this
    room and do this part of the project by myself. You're going to go into that room
    and you're gonna do that part of the project by yourself. Then we're gonna smush
    it together at the end.” And I was like “In industry, when we say ‘collaborate’,
    it means we're gonna sit next to each other. There's gonna be one keyboard and
    you're gonna have to feel comfortable looking stupid. You have to feel comfortable
    admitting that you don't know everything.” I think that's a big barrier to get
    over. But once you get over that, you learn so much. So that would be my big thing.

    that be enough? So networking, and learning to code. There is a comment about
    a publication being in a top data science journal that says “first authors”. Do
    you think that would be an important thing to do?'
  sec: 2402
  time: '40:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Nobody cares. There's one team in Klarna that does research exclusively. They
    do really awesome research and they're a super fun group of guys. I have an ongoing
    debate with one of them about the utility of Bayesian statistics. They're super
    great, but I think most people in industry don't have a background in academia,
    so they don't care about the publications that you've done. I always look at people's
    papers if I see that they've published on LinkedIn. Before I interview them, I'll
    get a background so I understand what they know. But unless you're applying for
    a research position in industry, that's not a skill that's valued, I don't think.
  sec: 2424

    it's important to have in order to get a job in data science?
  sec: 2463

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Real-World Data Work: Cleaning, Bash, and Domain Translation'
- line: When I'm looking for people, it's not. But I think with other people it might
    be. I think if the person you're interviewing with has a background in engineering,
    then I think it makes a difference because they like being able to see what you've
    done. If I see that, my first thought is like, “I like that you've put in the
    effort. But that is so far away from real-world data that you're not gonna be
    able to use a lot of those techniques in real world production.”
  sec: 2472
  time: '41:12'
  who: CJ
- line: I had a junior data scientist I worked with at Klarna and she was brand new.  She
    just started and came out of her Master's. I even had her do the training data.
    I was like, “Here's a giant training data set.” And she was like, “I had no idea
    how much of this was going to be cleaning the data. The datasets always come nice
    and clean when we do them in school.” I was like, “Yeah. No. That’s what it looks
    like. I'm terribly sorry.” That's why I think I put less value on that. In my
    experience, a lot of pet projects for data science tend to pull from the really
    easy to find and really clean datasets, and those aren't always very meaningful.
  sec: 2472
  time: '41:12'
  who: CJ
- line: The projects you did in academia weren't clean. You had to clean them a lot.
    That could be a good portfolio project, right? You could say, “Okay, I have this
    massive amount of genomic data of three or four gigabytes.” Then you needed to
    do some bash stuff to digest that.
  sec: 2544
  time: '42:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Even now, when I have a massive data set and I'm trying to figure out
    how I need to parse it, I'll usually turn to bash first. But I think that's harder
    to translate, right? Because if I tell somebody like, “Oh, yeah. You built some
    de novo transcriptomes on long and short sequencing reads.” That means something
    to somebody in biology. If I'm going for a biotech job, yeah – it's super important.
    Put it in there. But I wasn't going for a biotech job, I was going for a fintech
    job. Those words don't mean anything to the people I'm applying to.
  sec: 2568
  time: '42:48'
  who: CJ
- line: People always tell us “You should tailor your CV to the job you're applying
    for.” And I tend to tailor my speaking style to who I'm applying for. If I think
    the person isn't going to understand the jargon, I'm not going to use it. I think
    that that's worked for me in the past, but it depends on what you're doing and
    what you're looking at.

- header: 'Communication Shift: Simplifying Explanations and Office Culture'
- line: Yeah, thanks. We have a question about when you transitioned from academia
    to industry, “Did you have to adjust your way of communicating and interacting
    with colleagues? Was it difficult for you?”
  sec: 2624
  time: '43:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh yeah. I really hope that nobody who was at N26 when I first started is
    in this conversation, because it was incredibly difficult. They will tell you
    all of the mistakes that I made. But they were mistakes that were easy to learn
    from. One of them was – I say this to people now, especially if they're giving
    talks – nobody likes feeling stupid. But it was really hard for me to just… this
    is so arrogant. It was hard for me to adjust to the idea of knowledge that I thought
    everybody knew. I’ll use an example where I was talking to a project manager.
    We were talking about this A/B test he had done and he really wanted to understand
    whether or not it was significant. So I ran this distilled analysis for him. Then
    I was talking about p values and he's just like, “Okay, CJ. I need to stop. I
    have no idea what a p value is.” And I was like, “Oh, okay. Let’s take a step
    back.” [laughs] So things like that.
  sec: 2644
  time: '44:04'
  who: CJ
- line: But also… everything. Like the whole idea of Slack, I can’t even tell you.
    I started and I was brand new to the industry, brand new job, brand new city –
    complete change. I was scared to post emoji responses on Slack to what other people
    were saying for the first week. I was just like, “Oh my God. What if it's an inappropriate
    thing? What if I'm doing this wrong?” That was a whole means of communication
    that I had to learn better. There was so much. But a lot of it was cultural and
    I think the biggest thing for me is this realization that in academia, everybody
    has a similar experience.
  sec: 2644
  time: '44:04'
  who: CJ
- line: If you get to be a postdoc, then you know that every single person has done
    a PhD – there might be some edge cases – but everybody knows what it's like to
    think, “Okay, I have $2 in my hand and that's all the money I have to feed myself
    for the next two weeks.” Right? You have this shared experience. And things like,
    “Okay, I defended my dissertation. It was incredibly difficult. I cried in the
    hallway.” But everybody has these shared experiences. As you move forward in your
    career in academia, you have these shared experiences that you can bond over.
    That doesn't exist in industry, right?
  sec: 2644
  time: '44:04'
  who: CJ
- line: I remember, we were in the bank and we're talking about doing an overdraft
    experiment, and they're like, “Oh, we'll just issue a couple people 250 euros
    in overdraft.” And the people in the bank were like, “Who's ever going to use
    250 in overdraft. That's no money at all.” And I just looked at them like, “Oh,
    you've never been poor.” We didn't have these things that were shared, things
    that you can rely on in terms of the culture in academia. So I had to shift the
    way I was communicating with colleagues. Not just the tools and not just the idea
    that I assumed everybody knew a thing, but also the shared experience that no
    longer existed.
  sec: 2644

    with Slack right now.

    at the time will tell you that I just walked around with this terrified look on

    knew. [laughs]'

  who: CJ
- header: 'Team Dynamics: Open Offices, Proximity, and Social Bonding'
- line: Also, I think, – in academia, at least – in the places where I was a student
    or where I visited, it's always rooms. You have rooms where people sit – it's
    not open spaces. So it's a room with two or three people, but it's always a room.
    Then when you get to industry, it's usually a floor without walls and people sit
    together. Was it also difficult for you to get used to?
  sec: 2838
  time: '47:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Surprisingly, no. But I think that's just a ‘me’ thing. I could see how that
    would be a problem for other people. But when I get in the zone and I'm really
    focused – the same thing is true when I'm reading a book. There could be bombs
    exploding around me and I have no idea. When I get focused, it doesn't matter
    what's happening around me. I also like the social aspect of it a lot. Like I
    said, one of my best friends is still the head of data analytics at N26.
  sec: 2865
  time: '47:45'
  who: CJ
- line: At the time, the data team was only 10 people. So the data science team and
    the data analytics team sat right next to each other. Our chairs were right next
    to each other. Day two, we were immediately best friends. So he made me laugh,
    and I have a really loud laugh. But he made me laugh so much that, as the data
    team grew and the data science team ended up in a different space, and we weren't
    sitting next to each other anymore, like half of the office commented, “Now that
    Robin and CJ aren't sitting together, everything is a lot quieter around here.”
    He wasn't making me laugh as much and so the whole area quieted down. So I could
    see how it would affect other people. But the open space wasn't a weird thing
    for me.
  sec: 2865
  time: '47:45'
  who: CJ
- header: 'Counterproductive Habits: Competitiveness vs. Collaboration'
- line: Okay, yeah. I'm also curious, from the skills you had before in academia –
    we talked about many that were actually useful like being able to clean data,
    to process large amounts of data, and all the statistical things. But what about
    things that weren't useful? Things that were maybe even harmful? Were there things
    like that or no?
  sec: 2930
  time: '48:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Oh, I was asked this the other and I forget what my answer was. Things
    that weren't useful. The competitiveness. Like I said, in industry people tend
    to collaborate more. So hiding what you don't know and trying to compete with
    your colleagues – I think that’s really not useful in industry. I think that it
    can be really harmful. But that's something that's innate in academia, because
    everybody is like cutthroat to beat each other. Yeah. Again, I was really lucky
    that my team was really collaborative at N26. But even then, it took me a couple
    of weeks to feel really comfortable looking stupid in front of other people.
  sec: 2958
  time: '49:18'
  who: CJ
- line: In academia, everybody's really smart, but you're also spending a lot of time
    trying to be smarter. You don't show as many vulnerabilities, so it took me a
    couple of weeks to really feel comfortable. Being like, “I don't know this. Can
    you help me figure it out?” I think that potentially can be really harmful. I
    think the same thing was true of this colleague at Klarna who had just come from
    a math PhD. It took him about two months to admit that he didn't know something.
    He really struggled with that and it was the same problem where it's like, “This
    is not how we were taught to behave.” But this is how you need to behave in order
    to be successful in this new environment.
  sec: 2958
  time: '49:18'
  who: CJ
- line: Is that any way to… you just need to do this, right? You just need to be in
    that environment, learn, and try to adjust, right?
  sec: 3056
  time: '50:56'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Psychological Safety: Team Rituals, Sharing Failures, and Trust'
- line: Yeah. The way that I'm doing it now – because I'm facing a similar problem
    at my current position, where I'm leading people and trying to get them to feel
    comfortable talking to each other and feel comfortable being stupid in front of
    each other. The way that it worked at N26 for me – we had this Russian data engineer
    who still rules with an iron fist, he's fantastic. He read the fine print and
    found out that you could do a team dinner once a month. There's a budget for it.
    But once a month, you could take the team out to dinner. The data team was the
    only team at N26 who did this often. Once a month, we all went out to dinner and
    just hung out with each other.
  sec: 3065
  time: '51:05'
  who: CJ
- line: I think a lot of it is being able to break down the barriers, establishing
    that these people are your friends, and that they're not judging you. Then the
    dumb questions can come and then you can feel comfortable asking that. But I'm
    doing the same thing right now where there's a lot of knowledge silos at my current
    company and I’m like, “We're all gonna go hang out and eat dinner. We're gonna
    go hang out drinking. I'm throwing you guys an event to do this.” Just so that
    I can get people to feel more comfortable looking stupid. I also talk about how
    I fail. I try to get people to feel comfortable enough looking dumb in front of
    each other that they are willing to ask each other questions, even if they think
    in their mind, “This is a dumb question.” If you don't ask, you won't know the
    answer.
  sec: 3065
  time: '51:05'
  who: CJ
- line: Okay, yeah. Thanks. So basically, people just need to be comfortable with
    each other, get used to each other, and it just takes a bit of time. You don't
    feel comfortable immediately. You just need to give yourself a bit of time and
    then things become easier.

    to research or explore a topic that may not have an immediate impact on your job,
    but led to long-term value?”
  sec: 3165
  time: '52:45'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 3186
  time: '53:06'
  who: CJ
- line: I think so.
  sec: 3188
  time: '53:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Natural language processing is one of my favorite things and I employed
    it within other data. But I haven't done many full natural language processing
    assignments. At N26, and then at Klarna as well, I used that time in the morning
    to study and learn new things, like trying new Kaggle competitions and learning
    new techniques. Although I've never deployed a full NLP model, I know that those
    things are useful. Now I'm leading people, so I'm not doing as much as an individual
    contributor, but we have a couple of assignments that will be NLP assignments.
    So I know I can now help other people, my people, to learn the skills that they
    need so that they can succeed in this assignment. Even though I haven't actually
    used it myself yet.
  sec: 3192
  time: '53:12'
  who: CJ
- line: That's quite an interesting perspective. So even though it wasn't immediately
    useful back then, you still help your colleagues. That's cool. What about Kaggle?
    Was it helpful for you?
  sec: 3247
  time: '54:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, because I don't actually compete. I just use it as a source of cool datasets
    and neat ideas. Then I can play around with those datasets and ideas and try them
    out. Also, I'll try it out myself first and try to solve it. But I was in the
    hiring pipeline at Klarna and obviously, I'm hiring now, and it's really interesting
    to see not just how I answered the question, but how other people do. That gives
    me a much deeper experience, because then you're like, “I didn't think about it
    from that angle. But now that I've thought about it from your angle, I've now
    incorporated that into my own mentality of ways I could approach this problem
    in the future.”
  sec: 3262

  sec: 3328
  time: '55:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is such a funny story. When I saw you put this down in the list of questions.
    I was like, “Yes, I wrote a textbook.” But it's really funny and it wouldn't have
    happened if I didn't have another really good collaborator. So I was teaching
    this course during my PhD. Parasitology was the course – the study of parasites.
    My PhD is on host parasite coevolution, so it was natural that I would be teaching
    parasitology. But the teacher, the professor, retired basically halfway through
    the semester. So we were sort of left in this position where I had to write the
    course. If you've never written a course from scratch, it's incredibly difficult,
    and it takes a ton of time. It probably put me back about a semester from graduating.
  sec: 3334
  time: '55:34'
  who: CJ
- line: But, I had this colleague, and I had the knowledge. I was like, “I know a
    lot about parasites. I've been studying this for the last 10 years. I know a lot
    about ecology. I know a lot about the evolution of them.” I had some ideas for
    what we could do for the actual class. So I would write and then she would edit
    it in such a way that made it friendlier to the students. We put together this
    whole class on a shoestring budget. We were driving the whole thing. We wrote
    the tests, set up the website – did the whole thing.
  sec: 3334
  time: '55:34'
  who: CJ
- line: At the end of the semester, because I was a graduate student, I believed that
    everything I did was worthless. But she has a much better sense of self-worth.
    So she approached the department, and she was just like, “Hey, we wrote this course.
    Do you guys want it?” And they're like, “No, we're not buying anything from you.
    You guys are free labor.” And she was like, “Cool, fuck you.” Then we went to
    a textbook company – I looked this up the other day – Hayden Macmillan or something
    like that. I forget the exact textbook company. But she approached them and she's
    like, “Hey, we wrote this course. We can turn it into a textbook if you guys are
    interested.” And they're like, “Yeah. Sounds great.”
  sec: 3334
  time: '55:34'
  who: CJ
- line: So next thing I know, Kim and I – Kim was my colleague, she's incredible.
    Kim and I are on this phone call talking about cover art for our textbook. I was
    just like, “I don't know how I got here, but this is great.” So yeah – we co-authored
    this textbook together. Then they set our deadline and I remember that four days
    before the deadline, we had to take all of the stuff that we'd written and put
    it into chapters that made sense. We had a schedule. We just sat on her couch
    – her husband took care of us – we just sat on her couch for four days rotating
    between pairs of yoga pants every 12 hours while he fed us and did laundry. And
    we just wrote for four days [laughs]. But yeah, it's “The Evolution and Ecology
