transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about the role of data science manager. We have a special
    guest today, Mariano. Mariano is actually my colleague and works as head of data
    science at OLX group. I think Mariano joined quite a while before me. You've been
    with OLX for five years, right?
  sec: 86
  time: '1:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, almost five.
  sec: 105
  time: '1:45'
  who: Mariano
- line: "When I joined OLX, Mariano was a senior data scientist, then I saw him transition\
    \ into a manager. Then after that, he became the head of data science. Mariano\
    \ has 13 years of experience, almost 10 of them were in data science. He's originally\
    \ from Argentina and then moved to Berlin. Now he lives in Barcelona. Also I have\
    \ here in the notes \u201CAnd he's obsessed with\u2026\u201D And then it's unfinished.\
    \ [laughs] So I don't know what you\u2019re obsessed with."
  sec: 108
  time: '1:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: With product applications. Yes. I am obsessed with the application of data
    science. That's the area that I enjoy the most.
  sec: 140
  time: '2:20'
  who: Mariano
- line: Okay. Welcome to our event, Mariano.
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you, Alexey, for having me. I think it's going to be strange because
    I know you. Thank you so much for having me. It's an honor for me. I think you're
    doing a great job with DataTalks.Clubs. I think it was the anniversary very recently,
    so congrats on that. I'm all yours. You're the driver now.
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Mariano
- header: "Mariano\u2019s background"
- line: Yeah, indeed. Actually, I wanted to get somebody on the DataTalks.Club podcast
    to talk about the experience of transitioning from an individual contributor role
    to a managerial role, and I couldn't think of anyone better for this conversation
    than you, Mariano. But before we go into our main topic of becoming a data science
    manager, I wanted to ask you about your background. Can you tell us about your
    career journey so far?
  sec: 179
  time: '2:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Sure. I'm a computer scientist and went to university for this subject. I\
    \ did a Master\u2019s back in Buenos Aires a long time ago \u2013 more years than\
    \ I would like to say. But I was already working as a software developer, more\
    \ or less, at the same time that I was doing college. I started working first\
    \ as a data analyst, then as a Java developer, web developer. I even took a shot\
    \ at mobile games. Data was my passion and within my Master\u2019s, and I focused\
    \ a lot on that and ever since."
  sec: 207
  time: '3:27'
  who: Mariano
- line: "That's how I jumped into applications of data science in the industry. Mostly\
    \ because I found it more attractive to work with something where you could experiment\
    \ very often, and if you made mistakes, it\u2019s not so good. The targets were\
    \ very clear and we had checklists. I found it very assuring. Then, I changed\
    \ companies twice, but I was always working in the area of data science \u2013\
    \ things around personalization, recommenders, marketing, segmentation, etc. It\
    \ was always around ecommerce, you can say. Most of my experience is in ecommerce."
  sec: 207
  time: '3:27'
  who: Mariano
- line: "Then I tried OLX almost five years ago and I had an amazing experience. I\
    \ moved across three countries and worked with all types of people, cultures,\
    \ projects, endeavors. It was super fun. So that's my summary. Please interrupt\
    \ me, because you know me very well \u2013 I can go for hours without actually\
    \ talking about anything, so. [laughs]"
  sec: 207
  time: '3:27'
  who: Mariano
- header: Typical day of a manager
- line: "[laughs] I was thinking \u201COkay how am I going to stop you?\u201D [laughs]\
    \ I\u2019m just joking. Tell us a bit more about what you do as a manager. What\
    \ does your day look like?"
  sec: 345
  time: '5:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Meetings. [laughs] Okay, not only meetings. There is a huge component of\
    \ spending time with people nowadays. More than I would like to say. Lots of meetings.\
    \ But it's mostly because they are required, not very necessary meetings. But\
    \ you need to spend some time with people. Also working on reviews and planning\
    \ of code projects \u2013 everything around project management. OLX is a very\
    \ large company, so some of the time goes on writing a combination of reports\
    \ and proposals \u2013 everything is very well documented. So some time goes on\
    \ that. The largest component and one that I enjoy the most, is mentoring, coaching\
    \ and people development \u2013 making sure that you help people keep growing\
    \ and being the best professionals they can be or they want to be. I could go\
    \ deeper but I think that summarizes it."
  sec: 361
  time: '6:01'
  who: Mariano
- line: That's quite a lot of responsibilities.
  sec: 444
  time: '7:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. It takes a bit of energy but it's good energy. It pays back. And I\u2019\
    m not talking about monetary gain, I'm talking about the everyday rewards and\
    \ the satisfaction of doing it. It helps to do it."
  sec: 447
  time: '7:27'
  who: Mariano
- line: How large is your team? How many people do you manage?
  sec: 471
  time: '7:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's always changing. I think when I started as a manager it was five, then
    seven at some point, then four. Now I think it's eight-nine people. They all have
    different seniority levels and roles. We have data scientists and machine learning
    engineers. We have junior, mid and senior levels in all the roles and each of
    them cover different topics and aspects that are collaborating with the rest of
    the company.
  sec: 474
  time: '7:54'
  who: Mariano
- header: Becoming a manager
- line: "You said when you became a data science manager, five people reported to\
    \ you \u2013 you needed to manage five people. That's quite a drastic change from\
    \ having zero people reporting to you."
  sec: 519
  time: '8:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. I had some experience before that. Not experience that I would put on\
    \ my resume, but I had some experience mentoring and project management with two\
    \ people. It was \u2018light level management\u2019 because they were not reporting\
    \ to me. Jumping to five was a stretch and I had to learn a lot. It was a lucky\
    \ thing that I had many people to support, mentor, and guide me. I took an approach\
    \ of presenting myself as somebody who was learning. I was doing my best to help\
    \ and learn on the way together with everyone. By no means was I planning to make\
    \ drastic decisions and things like that, without consulting someone first and\
    \ discussing it with the team. At the time I was relying a lot on other people\
    \ to do it. But it was good \u2013 I like that I got to work with them. During\
    \ my first year, when I got my first experience, I was super lucky. Even though\
    \ I didn't choose the team, I was super lucky with the people I got to work with,\
    \ because they helped me. I helped them and they helped me to grow. They were\
    \ very experienced data scientists. So it was a very good experience."
  sec: 535
  time: '8:55'
  who: Mariano
- line: "Do you remember how it happened? I guess our manager came to you and said,\
    \ \u201CHey, Mariano. What do you think about managing five people at once?\u201D\
    \ How did it happen with you?"
  sec: 640
  time: '10:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Very good question. At that point it was more like, \u201CAre you interested\
    \ in this? It will help the company a lot.\u201D It was with my current manager,\
    \ Andreas, who said \u201CWe need to start growing the team and have more people\
    \ training.\u201D It\u2019s impossible after seven or eight people, it's super\
    \ hard. It\u2019s too much, because you\u2019re already distributing your time\
    \ across many people and the quality starts to drop. That's something you learn\
    \ after a certain amount of people that you manage. It's very hard to give your\
    \ all to them. Of course, with more experience you can do it better, but there\
    \ is still a limit. So, it was like that. And I said, \u201COkay, let's try it.\u201D\
    \ At that point, I was having a lot of fun in the company. I still do, but at\
    \ that point, I was super excited about absolutely everything. I was in the company\
    \ for one year and I had just moved from Argentina to Berlin, and I said, \u201C\
    Yeah, let's do it.\u201D Summer helped a lot. In summer, you feel much more energized.\
    \ So yeah, I jumped in and said, \u201CYes, let\u2019s do it.\u201D"
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Mariano
- header: Preparing for the transition
- line: So you agreed and then the next day, you woke up being a manager with five
    people reporting to you? What was the first thing you did when you found yourself
    managing a team?
  sec: 758
  time: '12:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think I got to know about it a few months in advance. Until it's announced\
    \ and doesn\u2019t actually happen, you don't know if it will happen. As soon\
    \ as I knew that they wanted to put me in the position, I had one month or so\
    \ to prepare myself. Luckily, I was on vacation as part of that. I was so excited\
    \ and used, not a lot, but maybe one or two days of my vacation to write down\
    \ my ideas and think about what will be my first few things that I will do \u2013\
    \ how will I structure my work. What I learned at that time was that there is\
    \ this practice of the 30-60-90 days to write your plan. I'm not recommending\
    \ to always stick to that, I\u2019m just saying that it should be the way to do\
    \ it. But it was a nice framework to follow and to structure your plan like \u201C\
    Okay, what I will do in the first 30 days, the first 60 days?\u201D"
  sec: 772
  time: '12:52'
  who: Mariano
- line: "In the first 30 days, I was meeting all of the people in the team, having\
    \ one-on-ones with all of them. I started reading a lot about management tips.\
    \ I didn't drown in it, but I was trying to see things here and there \u2013 things\
    \ that I shouldn't forget \u2013 especially what to do from the technical point\
    \ of view. Later, it was learning about all the projects they were working on.\
    \ It didn't have to be super-detailed but I thought I understood enough to help\
    \ them make decisions. They want somebody they could count on to make decisions."
  sec: 772
  time: '12:52'
  who: Mariano
- header: Balancing projects and assumptions
- line: How did you organize that? Did you ask them to onboard you? Did you go through
    the code? What exactly did you do there? I don't know how many projects there
    were, but with five people, I imagine it was like three to five projects for you
    that you maybe didn't know about before that point.
  sec: 897
  time: '14:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Maybe more. It was people that were already in the company for some time,\
    \ so all of them have at least one active project, plus one, two or maybe three\
    \ that they have already put in production at some point, and were maybe maintaining\
    \ them. It was a bit of everything. For some of them, I asked them to onboard\
    \ me, maybe to spend one hour explaining things to me. I remember, Piotr, who\
    \ is still in the company \u2013 I don't know how patient he was to explain everything\
    \ about advertising. He threw stuff on the board and explained what they were\
    \ doing. It was very, very challenging, because it certainly requires a lot of\
    \ agility. I thought I was super fast, because I could jump into any project and\
    \ learn it fast and do it. But sadly, I was onboarding on two, three, four projects\
    \ at the same time. So I had to be super fast."
  sec: 916
  time: '15:16'
  who: Mariano
- line: "An important thing to do was accept that you won't have all the information.\
    \ Of course you also need to trust the people. They are the ones doing this, so\
    \ if you have an idea, you should always start with the assumption that you may\
    \ have a total misconception of how the application, or the project, that they\u2019\
    re working on, works. So may start your phrases with something like \u201CBased\
    \ on what I understood\u2026 because I think maybe this could work.\u201D Maybe\
    \ you're starting with very wrong assumptions, because while you\u2019re learning\
    \ things, you have very partial information. So for me that was important."
  sec: 916
  time: '15:16'
  who: Mariano
- line: Do you remember how many times you were wrong in your assumptions?
  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Many. Even up to this day, I'm usually more wrong than right. But I don't\
    \ stop proposing because even if it's wrong, it triggers a discussion and I think\
    \ it structures knowledge around the topic. I'm okay feeling stupid all the time\
    \ as long as there is a flowing discussion and we think about all the problems\
    \ together. Because when I ask a \u201Cstupid\u201D question, the team will explain\
    \ to me, \u201CNo, you're wrong, because it\u2019s not that, it\u2019s this.\u201D"
  sec: 1046
  time: '17:26'
  who: Mariano
- line: Then you learn about the project more, right?
  sec: 1092
  time: '18:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I learn and based on that, they can think of an alternative solution. Also\
    \ because I start with the wrong assumption, sometimes I bring a solution that\u2019\
    s out of the box. I think of something in a different structure and that triggers\
    \ a process - they laugh, but then they look at the idea and say \u201CIf this\
    \ were different, this will work. So what can we do to make it to that?\u201D\
    \ It's more like that. I'm not shy when it comes to seeming stupid in front of\
    \ people that report to me. Something I always say is that data science is an\
    \ area that everybody specializes so much. Everybody works in such specific domains.\
    \ It would be super arrogant to say that you know everything you're working with."
  sec: 1095
  time: '18:15'
  who: Mariano
- line: I think that anybody who is a specialist in data science knows that they're
    specialists not because they know all of data science, but because they are able
    to learn new things and adapt. But there is no way to know everything. Being a
    manager actually gives you less knowledge, because now part of your time is not
    on the technical aspects, but the people and the processes. You have to pay attention
    to all those areas as well.
  sec: 1095
  time: '18:15'
  who: Mariano
- header: Search and recommendations
- line: "Did I understand correctly \u2013 I know before becoming a manager, you were\
    \ a senior data scientist in the relevance team, so you were dealing with recommendations\
    \ mostly, right?"
  sec: 1186
  time: '19:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. It was mostly everything around search and recommendations. At OLX,\
    \ which is an online classifieds place where people come to buy stuff, so from\
    \ the moment the user comes to buy, they have three ways to find things, more\
    \ or less. Maybe a few more than three, but let's talk about the main ones. One\
    \ is navigational \u2013 where they go through the categories and start applying\
    \ filters. The other one is through the search bar, which is one of the areas\
    \ where we do the most applications \u2013 around the search. And the other one\
    \ is through recommendations \u2013 when they\u2019re on the homepage, when they\
    \ navigate and see \u201CMore like this\u201D. Or even when you reach the end\
    \ of the results for search, what we recommend so that you keep searching. These\
    \ are more or less where I was strongly experienced in, at least for the last\
    \ few years."
  sec: 1197
  time: '19:57'
  who: Mariano
- header: Dealing with unfamiliar domains
- line: So the people you needed to manage were working on advertisement projects,
    right?
  sec: 1264
  time: '21:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, in a very specific area.
  sec: 1272
  time: '21:12'
  who: Mariano
- line: It was about real time bidding and these types of things, right?
  sec: 1274
  time: '21:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Kind of. It actually confused me a lot because I didn't know this thing beforehand,\
    \ at least not in detail. That was my first \u201CAha!\u201D moment, because I\
    \ assumed it was the team that we were using to do publicity for OLX \u2013 to\
    \ send traffic to OLX. But no, it actually was the team that managed the spaces\
    \ we sold at OLX for third-party advertising on our platform, how to optimize\
    \ the different areas. This involves things like how to do what's called \u201C\
    geo match,\u201D how to personalize, and how to have better performance of the\
    \ campaigns that are sold at OLX. That was really super new for me and I had to\
    \ start doing a lot."
  sec: 1279
  time: '21:19'
  who: Mariano
- line: So you knew nothing about this domain, right?
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, not at all. Like they say in Spanish, I was with a parachute landing,
    you know? Improvising. If Pawel and Piotr are listening, my apologies. It was
    hard for me.
  sec: 1350
  time: '22:30'
  who: Mariano
- line: So it was quite difficult for you to get. Not only did you need to learn everything
    but you also needed to manage people who are doing things that you don't know
    much about. Right?
  sec: 1375
  time: '22:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. Then it becomes a little bit of extrapolating the learnings you have\
    \ as data scientists to other areas. Because some things are different, such as\
    \ the domain, and maybe some of the models. Not all of them, but some of the models.\
    \ But there are also things that don't change. The structure of a machine learning\
    \ project, making sure that you correctly define the problem statement, what type\
    \ of problem you have at hand. As a basic, is it regression or classification?\
    \ But even later, things like \u2013 supervised/ unsupervised. But even inside\
    \ those categories \u2013 what type of problem are you solving? What are the caveats?\
    \ Because not everything falls into boxes automatically. Even if you want to say\
    \ \u201COh, this is such and such a problem.\u201D Sometimes you can change the\
    \ lens and it still works. So, this part is still the same."
  sec: 1389
  time: '23:09'
  who: Mariano
- line: "Feature engineering also stays. Maybe a few new techniques here and there.\
    \ Also, the whole evaluation and connecting to KPIs \u2013 the monitoring, the\
    \ alerting, etc. There are many things which are common to any data science project.\
    \ Also, how to drive the hypotheses. When you are dealing with a problem and you're\
    \ stuck, and you need to improve. \u201CWhich hypotheses to rise? How to answer\
    \ them? What things to check? How to prioritize work based on impact? How to drive\
    \ analysis in order to decide what to test next?\u201D Those things \u2013that\
    \ exercise \u2013 stays similar across projects. Of course, coming up with ideas\
    \ and questions, it's always super hard. I'm not saying it's easy, but I'm saying\
    \ that the process of which stage to watch, that helps. I always guide people\
    \ in this direction. I think that should help them."
  sec: 1389
  time: '23:09'
  who: Mariano
- header: Structuring projects
- line: "So you were coaching and mentoring people more in the direction of how to\
    \ structure projects, how to approach this, how to actually form the problem that\
    \ you have in machine learning terms, and then measuring and all that. So it\u2019\
    s more about structuring your approach. Then you leave the domain knowledge and\
    \ actual modeling to your subordinates."
  sec: 1555
  time: '25:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. For example, let's say that the end performance is not good enough.\
    \ Then we must first figure out how to ask the right question. \u201CIs it an\
    \ overfitting problem? Not enough data? Model not strong enough? Is there a difference\
    \ between test sets and production data?\u201D I first help find answers to all\
    \ these questions. Then once we identify the problem \u2013 let's say we are overfitting.\
    \ Then I help with all the ideas around overfitting, all the tools we have at\
    \ hand to fight overfitting depending on the model, of course \u2013 undersample/oversample,\
    \ regularization, etc. Even feature engineering sometimes, or getting more features\
    \ \u2013 things like that always help."
  sec: 1576
  time: '26:16'
  who: Mariano
- line: "Or let\u2019s say the model is not strong enough, or the model is not learning,\
    \ \u201COkay, what data can we think of?\u201D Think about the domain. Sometimes\
    \ it's better not to think from the model point of view, but think, \u201COkay,\
    \ if I'm the person that needs to decide whatever.\u201D Because I always say\
    \ machine learning is an automatic decision system. At least in the way we apply\
    \ it \u2013 state the problem, apply automatic decision systems. I wouldn't put\
    \ this in a book \u2013 it's an oversimplification. But if that machine has to\
    \ make a decision, what extra data can you provide? What extra piece of information\
    \ are you going to add to help that decision? For that, you need to think a little\
    \ bit like, \u201COkay, if I wasn\u2019t working at OLX, and I needed to ask for\
    \ information about something to make a decision, what information would I look\
    \ for to make that decision?\u201D"

  time: '26:16'
  who: Mariano
- line: "Then we can take out the domain \u2013 \u201CHow to model that? How to get\
    \ the data?\u201D Because that's always super hard. Then the other part that I\
    \ also help in a lot is navigating the organization. That's the part that is not\
    \ so much data science, but it's more of a soft skill or a people skill. So you're\
    \ working on this problem and you need this amount of data to integrate to this\
    \ system or figure out how this part of the system works. So you have to make\
    \ the connection and make the conversations happen. In the real world, things\
    \ are not always super perfectly documented, or it\u2019s not perfectly clear\
    \ how things work in a company as big as this one. Sometimes it's challenging."

- header: Connecting product and data science
- line: "I think one thing you didn't mention is that you also help a lot \u2013 from\
    \ what I see \u2013 is connecting product people (from product management) with\
    \ data scientists and helping them by becoming a translator between them. That's\
    \ something that is quite important. Sometimes data scientists, as I remember\
    \ myself, tend to work on things that do not necessarily make a user impact. They're\
    \ just fun to work on. But then product managers come with some ideas and you\
    \ have to figure out how to connect these things."
  sec: 1769
  time: '29:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Maybe I forgot to mention this. If I can choose one thing to call the\

    period, then you have to stop the relationship, unfortunately. It's best for both
    parties. It's not only good for the company, but it's also good for the person
    because, otherwise, they will stay in a situation where they are always underperforming
    and they will end up with a stigma. They're always with a stigma of being the
    one that doesn't perform. They cannot grow in the company easily later on because
    there was a stigma that you started out super bad.

    \ time. It's the kind of situation that demands the most amount of work, in comparison\

    \ to that and start working, it's quite gratifying. It's a good situation. Not\
    \ everybody is super performing all the time. It will happen at some point of\
    \ your career that you are under the expectations. So it's good to have a heads\

    \ there is no recipe. It\u2019s something I have greatly internalized, because\
    \ I learned it the hard way. Except when you're working at big companies, the\
    \ Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple of the world, right? Or if you\u2019re working\
    \ on something very niche or very AI specific, \u2013 like an AI-centric company.\
    \ I don't try things that have not been proven before. It's not that it has to\
    \ be exactly like something that somebody already did before, but I usually try\
    \ things that certain conditions don't allow. But I usually like trying things\

    \ for them? Whenever I see that they're using something new that they were not\
    \ using before, that I am not aware of \u2013 then I want to study it. I\u2019\
    m also particularly interested in NLP. I really like it. Whenever there is something\
    \ new, like ELMO at the time now BERT and transformers, or other pre-trained things.\
    \ I try to say, I'm not cutting edge. To be honest, I don't need to be. For the\
    \ modeling part, I'm not cutting edge. But for me it really pays off to be more\
    \ cutting edge, or being on the latest developments, around the engineering point\
    \ of view of data science. That way I think where we're delayed, as far as I know.\
    \ Our trade \u2013 the world of data science \u2013 is past due at least five\
    \ years with practices. As a profession, it grew super fast. We now probably have\
    \ 10x the amount of data scientists now then what we had five years ago. The practices\
    \ that work in such large teams across the company are adapting all the time because\
    \ it's something new to work with so many data scientists. So that's the only\
    \ thing I keep super up to date with \u2013 what we call ML Ops, maybe? I think\
