title: Data Mesh 101
transcript:
- line: This week we will talk about Data Mesh. We have a special guest today, Zhamak.
    Zhamak is a principal Technology Consultant at ThoughtWorks and she's the inventor
    of Data Mesh, the thing that we will talk about today. So, welcome.
  sec: 144
  time: '2:24'
  who: Alexey
- header: Zhamak’s background
- line: Thank you, Alex. Thank you for having me. I have to just make a quick adjustment.
    Late last night, I did actually make an announcement that I have left ThoughtWorks.
    And I have started a textbook around Data Mesh. But we didn't get a chance to
    sync up. But, yes – I was a consultant at ThoughtWorks for more than a decade.
  sec: 159
  time: '2:39'
  who: Zhamak
- line: The first question I have for you is to tell us about your career journey.
    You briefly mentioned a part of your career journey just now. But maybe we can
    go a little bit back and you can tell us how it started?
  sec: 181
  time: '3:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it has been a journey, as in I haven't stopped in
    one place, in one country, or one industry segment. I have moved a lot – I have
    moved around. I started as a software engineer, and I think I remember I was 14
    (going too far back, but very quickly) I was 14, I lived in Iran, and it was a
    time of war between Iran and Iraq and there were sanctions. We weren't getting
    much into the country, not much getting out. My dad went to the UK on a work trip
    and bought a Commodore 64 and he came back with two basic programming books. [chuckles]
    On top of one of them had a picture of a computer that was hanging up handing
    out coffee or something and I thought, “Oh my god! Computers can do that.”
  sec: 197
  time: '3:17'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Since then I fell in love with programming. I became a software engineer later
    on. I’ve been in the tech industry for 20… 24-something years and the first half
    – more than the first half – of that was dedicated to deep tech products and R&D.
    I've done everything from firmware level, producing custom hardware in-house,
    to the largest scale distributed systems where data was a very important ingredient
    of the solution. With a larger scale, critical infrastructure monitoring before
    streaming was the thing, where analytics on streaming was a thing – we had a full
    stack system, building it. For the last 10 year, I came out of deep tech and went,
    I guess, across the board. I went to ThoughtWorks and worked with many larger
    scale companies that run the real world – infrastructure, communications, healthcare,
    and so on.
  sec: 197
  time: '3:17'
  who: Zhamak
- line: My focus has been mostly on distributed systems, initially, on the micro services
    and how to scale computing and solutions, I guess, applications for organizations
    that are complex. For the last five years, again, I made a transition and came
    this time to solve with Data Mesh. I worked with organizations to solve the complexity
    that surrounds data and getting value from data, and empowering people autonomously
    to get value from data. That led to the hypothesis of Data Mesh, so I was building
    solutions around that.
  sec: 197
  time: '3:17'
  who: Zhamak
- line: As of a couple of weeks ago, I've decided to leave ThoughtWorks. I realized
    there is a gap in the technology, mostly around enabling the experience of data
    folks, whether they are data producers or data consumers, to have a very peer-to-peer
    analytical data sharing model. I've now started very, very early days, a tech
    startup here in the Bay Area to build that new, reimagined developer experience
    and build the platform for it.
  sec: 197
  time: '3:17'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Sounds like a lot of fun.
  sec: 377
  time: '6:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: It has been. [smiles]
  sec: 379
  time: '6:19'
  who: Zhamak
- line: I think you mentioned what you did as a principal technology consultant. It
    was mostly consulting other companies about how to extract value from their data
    – how they should design their systems in order to make it easier for them to
    extract value from them, right?
  sec: 382
  time: '6:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. That involved all the layers of stack. Sometimes people think consultants
    are people that go and build a bunch of slide decks and wave their arms and then
    leave the company with a pretty slide deck. But that's not the case for ThoughtWorks.
    With ThoughtWorks, we did execution where companies needed to either introduce
    new capabilities or didn't have enough people and so on.
  sec: 402
  time: '6:42'
  who: Zhamak
- line: So yes, with my teams, I worked on building data infrastructures from the
    ground up, kind of like a data platform. And then on top of it, data products,
    and ML/AI use cases to take advantage of those data products. You can imagine
    it as more vertical slicing of all the layers of the stack involved.
  sec: 402
  time: '6:42'
  who: Zhamak
- line: So a customer would come to you saying, “Hey, it's a bit of a mess here. We
    cannot make any sense of data and what's going on. Can you please help us introduce
    some order here?” And then you would say, “Okay, just use Data Mesh. Here is a
    book.”
  sec: 455
  time: '7:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] It usually doesn''t. I hope that it works out that way, but it
    doesn''t. It doesn''t work that way. Customers usually come saying, “Look, we''ve
    been trying this for a year.” The hypothesis around Data Mesh came with very specific
    questions. These are technologically very advanced companies here on the west
    coast of the US, where I was located. That''s where I was meeting clients. They
    come and say, “Look, we''ve had a data strategy. We''ve done all of the on-prem,
    past generation of Hadoop and so on. Then we went to cloud and we had a data strategy
    – we moved all of our data to a big data warehouse on the cloud and we hired all
    of these data scientists, the head of personalization, we''re using AI. These
    people are waiting and still not getting access to the data they want. Or if they
    build something we can’t really deploy.”'
  sec: 471
  time: '7:51'
  who: Zhamak
- line: It was the process of data to value, and the value – whether it being an applied
    ML model or reports and dashboards that people can act upon – that process was
    full of friction, broken and very, very long. The customers usually look for (people
    are always looking for) silver bullets, “What can you sell me so that I can solve
    all my problems?” [laughs] And then usually, the process of engaging is getting
    involved and seeing “Okay. What are the use cases that you have in your organization?
    What are the friction points? Where are you in your maturity of technology? Do
    you have technical people in your organization to afford building some of these
    solutions?” and so on and so on. Then after that discovering assessment, you basically
    get in the trenches with the organization to deliver use cases and value while
    building their infrastructure or the team structure restructuring and so on. It's
    always a very, very tight collaboration.
  sec: 471
  time: '7:51'
  who: Zhamak
- header: What is Data Mesh?
- line: Does it have anything to do with Data Mesh? What actually is Data Mesh?
  sec: 589
  time: '9:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[sinister chuckle] Well, maybe. I guess the only connection of that past
    is that – once you work at a level where you see a lot of similar problems repeat,
    you become a great pattern matcher. The patterns of problems, and then the patterns
    of solutions emerge from these many touch points. I think that the hypothesis
    of Data Mesh came from seeing these repeating problems. What Data Mesh is, is
    really an answer to some of the core challenges that we''ve had for a really long
    time. But they''re becoming more pronounced because now we''re talking about application
    of data beyond a bunch of BI reports in a BI team.'
  sec: 596
  time: '9:56'
  who: Zhamak
- line: We're talking about application of data in every function of our products
    or services. Data Mesh was really an alternative way to get value from data involving
    how we structure our teams, how we even imagine or share data – the infrastructure
    and then the governance – so all of those pillars. It's a decentralized approach,
    meaning it's based on giving autonomy to independent teams without compromising
    quality or integrity or connectivity. So it's a decentralized socio-technical
    approach in managing, sharing, accessing data, particularly for analytical use
    cases at scale, in an organization between different business units or tech units
    or across organizations.
  sec: 596
  time: '9:56'
  who: Zhamak
- line: What it attempts to do is remove this “pipeline thinking” that data constantly
    needs to move to a pipeline, gets put in a pile, thrown processing or metadata
    and semantic and so on added, and then throw processing at it to get value from
    it. It really challenges that paradigm, because in that paradigm the time from
    data to value is very long. Data Mesh says, “Okay, how can we decouple these pipelines
    into smaller, self-contained units that encapsulate – whether it's a tiny pipeline
    or some sort of a computation and data – and metadata with data sharing API's
    that allows you, as a data user and ML engineer or data analyst, to analyze this
    directly (peer to peer) without a middle layer of a data team, directly access
    to data and run your analytical workloads distributedly and have a direct relationship
    with the people who are actual producers of the data without middlemen?”
  sec: 596
  time: '9:56'
  who: Zhamak
- line: You mentioned quite a few things and I think most of these things did not
    involve tools – it's more about how exactly you structure your team, how you structure
    your process, and how you build things rather than “Okay, use this, this, and
    this tool, and you will be good.” Right? So it's more about how exactly you plan
    your work, how you organize work.
  sec: 776
  time: '12:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely, absolutely. But it’s also about how you organize your architecture.
    Honestly, it pains me when people say, “Oh, here's a database. Here's a bunch
    of tables in a warehouse. Go knock yourself out and get value from data.” Because
    that's a very tightly-coupled, fragile way of using data – that data cannot change.
    The contract that exists today for data sharing with a giant pile of files or
    tables in a lake is a very tightly-coupled and fragile contract between the data
    producer and the user.
  sec: 800
  time: '13:20'
  who: Zhamak
- line: When you think about that, these autonomous, independently moving teams building
    and sharing data, then it goes beyond just the team to say, “Okay, what is the
    future of data sharing contracts between these entities? What is the future of
    data computation? What is the future of governance?” Then it really very quickly
    leaks into your architectural thinking and very quickly leaks into “Okay, what
    kind of tool can I reintegrate in this new model?”
  sec: 800
  time: '13:20'
  who: Zhamak
- line: So it's not only about every team doing things independently, but also keeping
    the big picture in mind and also introducing some standards. If you want to use
    data, you have to have some sort of recommendations – it shouldn't be just a bunch
    of tables that nobody knows how to use, but a proper set of documents that describes
    what is there, how to use it, and so on. Right?
  sec: 868
  time: '14:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. You said a key word there that I want to double-click on, which
    is “big picture thinking”. In the data world, we are fairly isolated and every
    one of us thinks… [off-topic side-tracking] Yeah. So if you think about that big
    picture thinking, right now the big picture that I see over and over again that’s
    put on diagrams – whether it's an architecture diagram, technology vendor diagram
    – is about a big picture that is organized with this pipeline thinking.
  sec: 895
  time: '14:55'
  who: Zhamak
- line: The big picture we want to shift to is a mesh model, which is a kind of a
    graph model in a way, where value is generated through the links between these
    data products, through the interactions and exchange of value between these data
    products. Unless we are able to see that big picture, we can't really make any
    changes. You can't say, “I'll just make a change in one team and that will give
    value.” No, because no value is – the formula is (n*n-1)/2. There is a number
    of interconnectivity and exchange of information between the nodes (nodes, of
    course, are architectural concepts and people). Yeah, that's super key.
  sec: 895
  time: '14:55'
  who: Zhamak
- header: Domain ownership
- line: I took a look at the table of contents of your book. I don't think I actually
    mentioned that you wrote a book about Data Mesh. But anyway, I took a look at
    the book and it's organized by what kind of Data Mesh principles there are – and
    the first principle was Domain Ownership. I think it's related to the thing we
    discussed, that teams work independently. There are units (maybe domain units)
    – can you tell us what a domain is? And what is this principle about?
  sec: 994
  time: '16:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, before answering that question, let’s step back for a minute. I started
    writing and talking about Data Mesh by first principles – by stating first principles.
    That was very key, because in today's world, we are thrown at so many tools and
    technologies that remove the ability for us to think for ourselves and we are
    constantly being reshaped by hand-fed, “Use this tool and magic will happen.”
    I really wanted to take a different approach. So, you're right. I started with
    this first principle and said “Okay, if we agree on these first principles, then
    each organization can come up with a novel and new way of bringing these principles
    to life and the implementations of data may look very different. Through that
    generation of ideas, in terms of implementation, the great ones bubble up.” That
    was the purpose of it.
  sec: 1030
  time: '17:10'
  who: Zhamak
- line: There are four principles and all of them work together. There is a reason
    there are four and we can talk about that after. The domain ownership principle
    is about aligning data work – data generation, data consumption – with groups
    of people, with a team of an autonomous group of people. The domain is one. And
    the domain is often an aspect of your business that some business person is thinking
    about, has a specific set of languages, words, vocabulary, and an outcome. We
    want to organize the data sharing model or data generation model in a way that
    each of these business units, that are the direct producers or direct consumers
    of the data, can work independently and yet interoperate.
  sec: 1030
  time: '17:10'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Let's describe that with an example. In the book, I use a hypothetical digital
    streaming company – I call it Death, but you can imagine a company like Spotify,
    SoundCloud, Apple Music, etc. If you have a business team and a tech team aligned
    with it, where their job is generating playlists – automatically curated playlists
    – the outcome of that team, that business domain of “playlist” is to really give
    an immersive and personalized experience to the listener. Then, that team with
    that outcome has a set of data that it’s generating, which is automatically classified,
    personalized, targeted playlists of music, and that team to do that (that's a
    machine learning model) requires data from other business domains. There is a
    business team that is thinking about the best class digital experience, so they're
    building the music players. They're a source of data, which is play events, or
    play sessions, how a user interacts with that player device.
  sec: 1030
  time: '17:10'
  who: Zhamak
- line: There is a business team whose objective is onboarding more listeners. As
    part of their onboarding process, they have more information about the profile
    of their listener, such as maybe their age – not exactly individuals, that gets
    too creepy – but as classes, a distribution of the listeners, like the geographical
    location. All of this information can be directly consumed by these business teams.
    People get confused when I talk about domain. Really, domain is just, if you zoom
    out and look at your business and the various objectives of your business – and
    if you're a modern digital business, you probably have technical teams aligned
    with those business objectives and business units.
  sec: 1030
  time: '17:10'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Let's go through a few cases. You have your listener team that's onboarding
    customers, you have your artists management – people that are managing the artists
    that are coming on the platform – you have your artists payments, people that
    pay the artists. These are all business function domains and they all generate
    data and they all generally take and they consume data. So we want to make a data
    production sharing model aligned with this unit and the reason for it is, that
    this model then scales out as you create more business functions, you expand,
    you grow your business into new areas, “Well, I'm going to create a new domain.”
  sec: 1030
  time: '17:10'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Let's say we decided to work with partners at this company. We're going to
    work with these yoga studios to play their music or the Peloton auto cycling companies,
    for example. Then you bring your partner team and they have data capabilities
    internally. They're responsible, again, for sharing the data and consuming data
    from others for their data-driven solutions.
  sec: 1030
  time: '17:10'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Maybe I'm jumping a bit ahead, because I haven't heard the other principles
    – you mentioned all these different teams, like music player team, artist management
    team, onboarding team, partners team. Let's say each of these teams has a schema
    in our data warehouse and they just publish data there, in the schema. Would it
    be a Data Mesh or is it too early to call it that?
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Um, I guess there are levels of maturity in terms of getting there. You might
    start with saying, “Look, we're still gonna have a centralized warehouse, but
    we're going to try to give some organization to how we structure the files or
    tables within this warehouse and structure the schemas.” That might be a good
    start, but it's not going to give you the outcome that you want. The outcome that
    you want is a very loosely coupled model of data sharing. The playlist team can
    change their schema, that can change their data – you can almost real-time share
    this information without really breaking anybody else’s. The data warehousing
    model of data modeling, interconnecting data so the correlations can be discovered
    and queries over multiple datasets can be executed – it's very fragile, again,
    it’s a tightly-coupled model. You know exactly what table and what columns – if
    you change that column or change that schema, your solutions that are doing cross-team
    or cross- schema correlations become broken.
  sec: 1371
  time: '22:51'
  who: Zhamak
- line: In addition to that, if you want to remove any sort of friction in terms of
    discovery, in terms of understanding, there's a lot more involved in data sharing
    than a schema and a bunch of tables. You've got to share all of the other real-time  (and
    when I say real time I don't really mean events) but things that are real-time
    can change and we want to share that, which is “Okay these are the guarantees
    of my data product. I update this monthly (or every second or every millisecond)
    the integrity of it. This is a near real-time data product.” But it actually has
    low integrity – it has missing information, it has duplicates versus “No, this
    actually gets reconciled nicely.” So there's a level of additional information
    that needs to be provided. Frankly, I'm not sure a data warehouse or data technologies
    that we had is the best way to share that information, because they’re built with
    a very different set of assumptions. But what you just described would be a good
    starting point.
  sec: 1371
  time: '22:51'
  who: Zhamak
- header: Determining what to optimize for with Data Mesh
- line: Because I was thinking about this scenario – so the playlist team needs to
    access data from the music player team, and then from the onboarding team. If
    it's just one data warehouse then it's just a join, right? You have this data
    here sitting in this table, in this schema, then you have another table sitting
    in this schema, you just do a join, and then you have your data.
  sec: 1526
  time: '25:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: But in the case where it's distributed and everyone has their own tools, data
    warehouses (whatever they have) then making these joins becomes a lot more difficult.
    So how do they do this? Do they pull data first to their intermediate storage,
    from this team, then from this team, and then they do join? Then they also need
    to make sure that they actually have something to join on – like, there is a common
    key.
  sec: 1526
  time: '25:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly.
  sec: 1576
  time: '26:16'
  who: Zhamak
- line: How does it happen in practice? Yeah,
  sec: 1576
  time: '26:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Again, there are different levels of complexity. We have to decide what we
    are optimizing for. So far, what I'm seeing with our solutions and the biases
    that we have, is mostly about optimizing for machine performance. But if you're
    in a really complex organization, and in fact, you lose a lot of cycles to deliver
    value because you optimize too much for the machines, we have these very tightly
    integrated keys that you can't forever change, then no matter how fast your machine
    is, your final outcome is suboptimal, because you actually, those joints are not
    really delivering much value. You can't even build new use cases.
  sec: 1578
  time: '26:18'
  who: Zhamak
- line: So just to start by saying there is a spectrum of what we are optimizing for.
    In the case that you just described, one might say, “Look, I'm doing Data Mesh
    within an organization. We happen to have standardized on some warehouses.” Maybe
    all of the data users are happy to use the warehouse, (which I find hard to believe),
    but let's assume that. Then, at the physical layer, one way of getting access
    to this data from different domains is warehouses. But at a logical layer, when
    people request access, when they discover even which table to go to, there is
    a dynamic set of API's that they have to call. So we can put a layer of indirection
    on top before you even get to the join to say, “If you want a playlist, actually,
    you call a different API that then will decide based on your version of the playlist
    you're requesting to which table to even go to.” That is a possibility.
  sec: 1578
  time: '26:18'
  who: Zhamak
- line: On the other end of the spectrum, you're actually working with organizations
    that haven't standardized on one platform, one tech, or even maybe, to take it
    to the next level, it’s sharing data across organizations. It'd be crazy to say,
    “Hey, everyone, go on the same platform, same cloud.” It doesn't make sense. So
    we have to solve for that solution. Today, what we have – which is not great,
    but it's a stepping stone – we have federated query engines. You can have tables
    in different data warehouses and let's say you have that first layer API, it directs
    you to the right table and database and schema and then you can run your query
    in a federated way and do your joins and do all of the things that you want to
    do. Yes, you are probably sacrificing some performance, even though those federated
    query engines are getting faster and faster. You're sacrificing some sub-millisecond
    or sub-second performance, but that is giving you a level of freedom and scale
    from the human perspective, that you couldn't have before if everyone had to go
    on the same platform.
  sec: 1578
  time: '26:18'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Then there are modes of consuming data that have nothing to do with SQL. There
    are modes of consuming data where you are reading structured streaming of data
    frames. Yes, you push some of your computation upfront to just pick the bits of
    the data that you want, but you're bringing in data to do downstream processing.
    And if you want to get really futuristic, that feature doesn't exist today, but
    I think that's where automation needs to head and that's why I thought, “Somebody
    needs to start a company to solve these problems.” That’s the future, where we
    put a stop in this kind of data movement model and say, “Okay, if where we want
    to get to is independent, rightful owners of the data independently changing,
    independently evolving – but yes, we want to have cross-cutting analytics and
    machine learning models – we have to define new data sharing API's that are in
    fact about receiving the computation, pushing the computation further and further
    up into those data products.
  sec: 1578
  time: '26:18'
  who: Zhamak
- line: If I'm training a machine learning model, and I'm doing matrix operations,
    can I do this distributedly on the right source of the data no matter what platform
    they come from?” I think that goes beyond just having a SQL type that is about
    sucking data out. It's about putting the computation onward and only sucking the
    bits that are really valuable to the outcome that you're generating. I don’t think
    we’re there yet. There are a few startups that are thinking about this kind of
    federated machine learning training model and so on, but I think it's a movement
    that needs to happen for this model to be practical.
  sec: 1578
  time: '26:18'
  who: Zhamak
- line: I guess the simplest way of implementing this is when every team has some
    way of accessing data and you (the playlists team) just pull it to your place,
    crunch it, and then create your product. Right?
  sec: 1865
  time: '31:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. And then you have to think about the simplest way in terms of “What is
    the minimal set of guarantees and information that I need to publish and provide
    to other teams so that they can discover, so that they can understand?” It was
    fine, maybe to go to one centralized data team and say, “Hey, knock on the data
    team – can you run this analytics? Can you find this data? Can you create this
    data?” But that model won't work when you're in this distributed way, so standardizing
    those APIs that describe and provide metadata and so on is also key in addition
    to the data itself.
  sec: 1879
  time: '31:19'
  who: Zhamak
- header: Decentralization
- line: So it's decentralized but there are some sort of central parts, like this
    API that you mentioned, this layer of indirection. We should define this in advance
    so that teams know how to communicate to each other. When we create a new domain,
    a new team, it follows the same API.
  sec: 1924
  time: '32:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: So if somebody needs to consume data from this new team, they already know
    how to do this because it's the same across all the interacting domains.
  sec: 1924
  time: '32:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Absolutely. Decentralization and centralization are two sides of
    the same coin. If you and I are on two separate computers, two different time
    zones, but we managed to have this conversation with all of those folks on the
    Q&A and on the chat – the reason for it is that we didn't say, “Oh, hang on, everyone.
    We should all be on the same server to talk to each other.” No, the reason was
    because we've got a TCP/IP stack that communicates and standardizes the seams,
    the interconnectivity, and then it gives us autonomy to be in whatever stack that
    we want to be locally.
  sec: 1948
  time: '32:28'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Absolutely the same thing exists with Data Mesh. We've got to standardize
    some cross-cutting concerns and one place to start with anything is about interconnectivity.
    Interconnectivity of these nodes – you can imagine them, as you said, like discovering
    them or joining them. This involves information about discovering this thing –
    what information it shares to say what it is in a standardized way. What language
    or what modeling language it uses to describe its data, its interfaces for the
    data sharing that you mentioned, or computation sharing. It’s identity management.
  sec: 1948
  time: '32:28'
  who: Zhamak
- line: The thing that sucks most, frankly, right now, in the real world is the security
    authentication, authorization and just modes of validating access to data. Every
    technology has its own. Even on a single cloud provider, [chuckles] that is not
    sorted out so that you can access resources from independent services, independent
    accounts. So we've got to come to an agreement around that. There's a ton of learning.
    I mean, we've done the internet – so we can always go back and see what were the
    key innovations (a small number of innovations) that allowed this federated model
    of capability sharing and apply that to data.
  sec: 1948

  who: Zhamak
- header: Data as a product
- line: That's an interesting metaphor with TCP/IP. I think you mentioned this set
    of guarantees multiple times. I suspect it's related to the second principle,
    right? The second principle is “data as a product”. Can you maybe tell us more
    about this principle? What is it about?
  sec: 2076
  time: '34:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, Absolutely. What drove Data Meshes was autonomy, independence – it was
    more about moving and being able to have an infinite scale of different domains,
    different parts of the business and just domain-oriented ownership. But, very
    quickly, that can turn into a siloing problem. “Well, I'm in the playlists domain
    and I have the data that I want. I will suck in somehow the data from other places
    and keep it for myself.” How are we any better than the siloing of application
    databases that we have today? Data as a product was to invert our relationship
    with data and think about data as a product that we share. We measure the delight
    and happiness of the data user and that's different from a relationship we have
    today, which is that data are assets that we collect and it's precious and we
    don't necessarily want to share with anybody.
  sec: 2099
  time: '34:59'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Data as a product is a set of underpinning practices and, again, technology
    that really focuses on the consumer first. Let's say, I am listener onboarding
    – I build listener registration apps, whether through a call center or through
    web or mobile – I receive listeners and I capture information about them. My job
    is to really optimize that process or the conversion from “Oh, I'm interested
    in this app!” to “I want to get free access and then try it and then pay for it,”
    is very smooth. So if I'm that team, then I'm generating a ton of data – the touch
    points with a user at the time of interest or registration. If I just collected
    that data – I got events from the plays, players, or applications, or web pages,
    and then I put them in some database or stream them and maybe someone downstream
    started using them with difficulty, we want to change that and say, “Hey, listener
    team. Of course, your responsibility is optimizing the process of engaging with
    listeners through registration. But also, you're responsible for the data that
    you generate to share that data with the rest of the organization based on their
    needs.” You very quickly realize that and you get measured.
  sec: 2099
  time: '34:59'
  who: Zhamak
- line: As a product, you have a set of KPIs that measures the success of your role
    as a data product owner. From that, then you can think about, “Okay, if I'm giving
    a product or sharing a product or selling a product – I’m building a product –
    what are the characteristics that I need to be able to articulate and share for
    the audience to do a self-assessment, to see whether it's the right product for
    them or not?” And one of those characteristics is about all of the information
    that you need to share for a consumer to trust your data, and then self assess
    its usability. When you think about establishing trust, it's about bridging the
    gap between what you know and what the customer needs to know.
  sec: 2099
  time: '34:59'
  who: Zhamak
- line: To bridge that gap, a set of information that you need to share are guarantees
    of your data products and then you can think about the guarantees as quality and
    time limits and integrity and completeness and a whole set of information. That
    changes all the time, right? It's not a static, “Oh, I shall have this level of
    completeness.” No. In fact, that constantly changes – so allow for that and then
    measure whether you are meeting those guarantees or not, and adjust your implementation.
  sec: 2099
  time: '34:59'
  who: Zhamak
- line: I guess if we come back to that example of the playlist team consuming clicks
    from the player team – as the playlist team, you want to be certain that there
    are no big problems with the quality of this data and this is one of the guarantees
    we expect from the player team.
  sec: 2342
  time: '39:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: If there are problems, we also expect this team to tell us about these problems.
    This is the contract between us, our domain, and their domain. If we have this,
    then their data (the clicks) is the product that we consume. Right?
  sec: 2342
  time: '39:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. That's exactly it. That assessment is really a conversation. The
    data product owner or the data product manager is a role that Data Mesh introduces.
    Their job is to have that conversation with users (domains) that are interested
    in that data and say “Okay, look. Today 80% of consumers are happy with kind of
    low integrity, but real-time because they've been building dashboards about anomaly
    detection and how the player is failing or working. But now we have these playlist
    folks and they're actually not interested in every single event or every single
    click. What they're interested in is a bit more high integrity sessions of an
    interaction. From the moment that somebody starts playing the application, what
    music they listen to, in what order, which ones they skip, which ones they listen
    to. So they're only interested in a holistic view of maybe all of the listeners.
    They’re looking for aggregates – they don't even look for every single customer
    – they want to see all of the customers and all of the tracks, and the relationship
    between those.”
  sec: 2376
  time: '39:36'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Then, in those conversations, you go, “Okay, actually, I have a data product
    about player click stream, but I need to now create another data product, or I
    need to create a new way of accessing this data product that gives the aggregate
    views that they're looking for. Yes, it's going to be less real-time. The guarantee
    becomes maybe this hourly, or whatever the processing window that makes sense
    for that aggregate. But the integrity is high.” So through that conversation,
    you then decide “Who should be building this product? Is it really the player
    team that should be building it? Or is it someone in the middle or the consumers
    themselves?” And then you manage your product ecosystem in that way.
  sec: 2376
  time: '39:36'
  who: Zhamak
- line: And then each team has these data product managers that you mentioned. It's
    their job to make sure everyone agrees on who is doing what. Right?
  sec: 2499
  time: '41:39'
  who: Alexey

    spectrum of consumers. Yeah.

  who: Zhamak
- header: Self-serve data platforms
- line: Okay. So what's the next principle? I have it in the notes. It's the principle
    of “self-serve data platform”. Can you unpack this? What does self-serve mean?
    What is a data platform?
  sec: 2518
  time: '41:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: I must say, the platform, by definition, should be self-serve. Self-serve
    is almost a redundant word in that phrase, but I wanted to kind of really emphasize
    and make it bold so we don't forget it. If you think about this model of autonomous
    business focus, I take people that are focusing on a particular domain – teams
    are now accountable for data products and their data computation pipeline, their
    data API – it's a lot of responsibility. The way the data systems or data platforms
    or data infrastructure is provided today, that requires a high level of expertise.
    That almost makes Data Meshing impossible from day one, because we can't recruit
    all of these people.
  sec: 2531
  time: '42:11'
  who: Zhamak
- line: What does that even mean? I put that there as a placeholder there to say,
    “If we really want to empower and enable these embedded data people in the domains,
    we need to rethink and reimagine our data platforms to make life of someone like
    a vanilla developer really easy to generate data products and use data products
    – or the life of an analyst really easy to consume that data and be able to play
    with it so we don't have to constantly introduce this intermediary role of analyst
    engineer or analyst as an engineer or ML engineer.” Maybe we can make that a little
    bit smoother and that requires really rethinking our approach to data technology
    in a way that removes that high degree of specialization. But, of course, you
    still need to have development experience and so on, and understand the characteristics
    of data, statistical modeling and things like that. Of course, you need to have
    capabilities that depend on your role – producer or consumer. But that proprietary
    tech expertise that you need to have needs to get reduced.
  sec: 2531
  time: '42:11'
  who: Zhamak
- line: The surface of this platform needs to kind of go up a little bit in terms
    of abstraction. So it was really a placeholder. In the book, I give examples of
    value stream like a working model – the day in the life of a data product developer,
    the day in the life of a data product consumer, and what is their level of abstraction
    that they can expect from the platform in order to do their job easily, to do
    their job faster, to do their job right? And I think that's missing. A lot of
    organizations are building that right now because it just doesn't exist. And it's
    my mission (the next, next, next mission) is to build the technology that delights
    the experience of data developers, (I’m just using the umbrella term ‘data developers’)
    whether they're consuming or producing. That's the third principle.
  sec: 2531
  time: '42:11'
  who: Zhamak
- line: If I can attempt to summarize, a data platform is a place where somebody who
    is not necessarily a data engineer – who doesn't know how Spark works, who doesn't
    know how Kafka works, who doesn't know all these things – they can just come,
    find the data they need, query it, do some analysis, and then maybe pull this
    data and start using it for their team, for the products. Right? So they don't
    need to hire a team of data engineers to be able to do this.
  sec: 2715
  time: '45:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, and I think we've got to be careful with that because that very quickly
    becomes, “Oh! I need to have a no-code/low code platform that nobody can test
    and understand afterwards.” So I’m definitely not advocating for that. I think
    software engineering practices, or good engineering practices, are evergreen and
    have to be built. But I think there is a set of services – someone might say,
    “Look, I am producing a data product (or I'm consuming a data product) and I want
    to work with data frames, or that.” So they might still use Spark as part of their
    work, but they don't have to worry about scaling it or running it or scheduling
    it. And they don't have to worry about, “Oh, this is just a vertical. I'm just
    writing the pipeline. And then I have to worry about the storage part of it. And
    then I have to worry about the security part of it.”
  sec: 2747
  time: '45:47'
  who: Zhamak
- line: There is a new experience generated that says, “Look, if you initialize a
    data product, I will give you all of the aspects involved in a data product and
    you just focus on that little part, the Spark code that you have to write for
    data processing (or that SQL that you have to do). You don't have to worry about
    anything else.” So you might still code and have visibility to these tools, but
    your experience using those tools changes quite a lot.
  sec: 2747
  time: '45:47'
  who: Zhamak
- line: When you said that we need to reimagine our data platforms, it was plural
    – platforms. Right? Each team has its own platform, or we have one global one,
    or how does it work usually?
  sec: 2834
  time: '47:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think everybody wants one giant, big, data platform that serves everybody's
    needs, right?
  sec: 2846
  time: '47:26'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Yeah, that sounds cool. Right?
  sec: 2852
  time: '47:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[laughs] Is that reality? I don''t think so. I think, again, it comes to…
    you see, Data Mesh, at its heart, embraces chaos and complexity. If you embrace
    chaos and complexity, then your solution has to be able to deliver value fast,
    reliably, and responsibly, despite the human chaos and complexity. If I said right
    now, “Oh, you decentralized all of the teams and have one platform to rule them
    all.” That is against that principle that I just mentioned. So I think, again,
    with the platform, the reality that is happening is that large organizations where
    Data Mesh makes sense – complex organizations – almost every country, sometimes,
    each business, they have their own technology and tooling and they don’t want
    to standardize.'
  sec: 2855
  time: '47:35'
  who: Zhamak
- line: The parts of the platform, again that you have standardized and you have common
    capabilities are what interconnects these platforms in terms of data sharing.
    And the parts that you probably don't care about – like, if one team wanted to
    use Prefect, or Airflow, or whatever for their data processing, so be it. Another
    team might be using some serverless technology for their data product (the computation
    with a data person) that's okay. But as long as those two can discover, understand,
    share, use and connect data, then have as many platforms as you want.

    What was the next principle, actually? I don't remember. It’s governance, right?
    Is it related?
  sec: 2953
  time: '49:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. All of these principles – I have a diagram in the book that describes
    the interrelation of these things together and why there's four and not three.
    In fact, I didn't have the first one for a while and then I added it because,
    based on experience, I realized, “Oh, God. If you don't get this right, we're
    doomed.” [chuckles] Where there are the cross-cutting concerns that we need to
    agree upon as an ecosystem of independent nodes on the mesh, and need to be able
    to implement in an automated computational fashion. “Governance” is a word we
    use a lot in the data space. In fact, it's a word that is not as much used in
    the microservices operational world – we just call them “policies” or “cross-cutting
    concerns”. So I use the same language that the data community uses – the word
    governance.
  sec: 2965
  time: '49:25'
  who: Zhamak
- line: To me, it's one of those scary words that is very hard to implement without
    putting controls that slow people down, so I had to add the “federative and computation”
    to it in order to fit in this model. The problem that can arise from diversity
    of the platforms, or diversity of the data products and independence of those
    is, again, a lack of trust at a global level. How do I know that, now that every
    team is doing its own thing in terms of data sharing, the policies that are important
    to the company (not just to one team, but important to the company) are implemented?
    How do we know that we are all talking the standard language when we're exposing
    data? Those are those common cross-cutting concerns around all of that – all of
    the existing governance concerns like privacy, security, various policies, as
    well as the standardization for intercommunication, need to be implemented, but
    need to be implemented in a way that, again, it embraces the complexity and chaos
    of the organization. It embraces moving fast, but responsibly, without breaking
    things.
  sec: 2965
  time: '49:25'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Then it says, “Okay, if we apply engineering to the problem – I did come from
    a very software engineering-heavy view of the world and I admit that – how did
    we solve this before?” You can go back to the internet or go back to my source
    of “How did we solve that before?” We solve that with computational-heavy as in
    heavily-automated capabilities that get embedded into every individual service
    in the microservices or in individual data products. There are many examples of
    that and there are architectural ways of doing that. That's the computation part.
  sec: 2965
  time: '49:25'
  who: Zhamak
- line: For example, if a team says, “Oh, I want to share this product in this mesh.
    I'm going to run this command and get all of the things that I need to have in
    a standard way.” One of those things would be a way of configuring your privacy
    level and have the platform or that computation part take care of encryption at
    the right level, access control at the right level. Then the question of “Who
    defines these policies?” That's a federated operating model. These domain data
    product teams need to be part of that global conversation.
  sec: 2965
  time: '49:25'
  who: Zhamak
- line: I guess this is related – we talked about data sharing API – having this API
    actually belongs to this principle, right? Not “belongs,” but this principle says
    that you should have one. Is that right?
  sec: 3168
  time: '52:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, this principle influences the common pieces across all of your data.
    API is one of those common pieces, but there are other common pieces such as the
    policies that impact the data itself – like, what's the retention policy? What's
    common is not that everybody has the same retention policy, but everybody has
    a retention policy with different values. Some data can be kept forever, some
    data, perhaps because of the sensitivity, has to be kept only temporarily, like
    for a few hours.
  sec: 3182
  time: '53:02'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Having a thing that says “Every data product shall have a retention policy”
    is a common characteristic, but then automating configuration and enforcement
    and validation of that policy is the platform piece. And then giving autonomy
    to the teams to define what their value for that potential policy is, is the domain-oriented
    piece of it. Then exposing that policy as part of your data product discovery
    or understanding the information is the data part of it. So it does impact all
    of these pieces.

    think this could be related to what we just discussed – all these four principles.
    The first one is “What is the most important thing about Data Mesh for us to understand,
    learn, and adopt?”
  sec: 3260
  time: '54:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: What is the most important thing to learn? Is that the question?
  sec: 3277
  time: '54:37'
  who: Zhamak
- line: “To understand, learn, and adopt.” We can start with the “understand” part
    first.
  sec: 3281
  time: '54:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I had a lot to do last year, but I decided to sit down and write this
    book so that I can put all the information that you need to know in order to understand
    it. I think if you – I’m not just not trying to sell my book – I can share a link
    that you can freely access with a short period of time on O'Reilly. That's what
    O'Reilly offers. But I think when I wrote this book from the perspective of what
    people need to know to understand (before this concept was completely bastardized
    by the industry into something unrecognizable) was that you first you need to
    understand “why” as in “What conditions have led us to think about Data Mesh in
    the first place?” And if those conditions don't apply to you, don't even bother
    about the rest.
  sec: 3288
  time: '54:48'
  who: Zhamak
- line: Then second is the “what” like, “What are the first principles that drive
    this definition so that you can think for yourself about how to apply those first
    principles to your exact implementation?” And then the third is “how” and the
    “how” involves both technology, architecture, and organizational change. There
    is an organizational change. Yeah, I think you've got to kind of understand it
    top-down, today. If we were five years in future and Data Mesh was just business
    as usual – everybody did Data Mesh and there were so many tools that help you
    bootstrap – maybe as a practitioner, the question around “why” and “what” has
    been answered, and you only need to focus on “how”. And even then there is a platform
    that serves you – you don't need to get philosophical about it. [chuckles]
  sec: 3288
  time: '54:48'
  who: Zhamak
- line: You can just run a command and get data products. That's just how life is
    implemented. So then Data Mesh really moves into the background. It becomes “just
    the way we do things,” right? We don't even talk about it. But if you ask me that
    question today, we still need to be informed about “why” and “how” because there
    is so much misinformation and “opportunistically published” (incorrect in many
    cases) content out there that I would, as a learner, want to protect myself against
    and have a way to think and judge for myself.
  sec: 3288
  time: '54:48'
  who: Zhamak
- header: Adopting Data Mesh
- line: Then there was another part, “What is the most important thing about Data
    Mesh for us to adopt?” And I think it's related to a question from Jeffrey, which
    is, “What is the best way to start implementing Data Mesh from scratch?” We don't
    have a lot of time, maybe you can summarize it?
  sec: 3431
  time: '57:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think part five of the book is actually just that. I introduced the
    whole model around a kind of iterative, end-to-end, business-driven, use case-driven
    way of implementing this. And I give a ton of tools around even how to measure
    whether you're doing the right thing, how to select the first domains, how to
    select the first capabilities of your data. So there's a lot of content in the
    book that I recommend for you, if you're interested to have a look. But in short,
    I would say – start with the first self-assessment. Are you ready? There's a spider
    graph in the book that says “If you want to apply Data Mesh today, you really
    need to have top down support.” Because you're talking about a transformation
    – it's not a little Skunkworks project that you can do in a corner somewhere and
    say, “I've got this.” It’s a scale problem.
  sec: 3447
  time: '57:27'
  who: Zhamak
- line: So yeah – do you have your executive support? Do you have the type of technologies
    that you need to have? Do you have the right DataOps or DevOps practices? There's
    a lot of software engineering involved and engineering involved in doing Data
    Mesh. So start with the self-assessments, find allies, find parts of the organization
    that lend themselves to this model first, and start small – with use cases that
    touch one or two domains. Don't start with a marketing use case, because they
    need data from all of the domains to deliver even the smallest piece of value.
    And you build your platform iteratively and smartly.

  who: Zhamak
- line: Don't start with completely decentralized models. Started with a team of different
    disciplines that come together, like different domains, or a platform team or
    governance team come together, but they work very collaboratively initially. Then,
    once you establish your ways of working in your interoperability layers, then
    you can become fully autonomous and decentralized.

- line: I have to check. I think I do, but let me just be responsible and check my
    calendar quickly. [chuckles] It takes a couple of minutes to find my calendar.
    Let's bring up the next question.

  who: Zhamak
- header: Resources on implementing Data Mesh
- line: Yeah. This should be a short one. “Do you know of any good reference implementation
    for Data Mesh where we can look at this and learn from this?”
  sec: 3591
  time: '59:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Super good question. There are not many. I don't. Short answer – nothing that's
    publicly available that I can point to and say “Go look at that implementation.
    That's a good one.” But there is a talk that a colleague of mine and I gave a
    while back. ThoughtWorks has a Data Mesh website and there is one around, I think
    “lessons learned” and in that one, we share a little bit about the technology
    that we use. But there isn't a Git repo that I can point to and say, “Go have
    a look at what these guys have done. Looks pretty good,” unfortunately.

- line: One other place that I would say go and have a look is the Data Mesh Learning
    Slack channel and Data Mesh Learning Meetup. There are a bunch of case studies
    people have shared in terms of their implementation. Every implementation is slightly
    different and nothing looks like this future that I'm painting for you here. So
    we are really in the early stages. I kind of went through the microservices API
    revolution in my career and it was like 2011-2012. We were excited about this,
    but nothing existed. Containerization didn't exist, embedded web services didn't
    exist – none of it existed. So we were doing these kinds of fugly micro services
    on top of a big giant web application. So that's where we are right now. We are
    kind of banding it and hacking it together. But those two places should give you
    some ways of thinking about how people have started with the technology we have
    today.

  who: Zhamak
- line: Yeah, I started imagining how it would look – how it will look like in 10
    years. It probably will be quite exciting. With some special [cross-talk].

  who: Zhamak
- line: Okay. Yeah. Thanks a lot for sticking around for a couple of more minutes
    with us and, in general, for sharing your experience, expertise, your knowledge,
    and for answering questions. That was a fun chat. I learned a lot. I think everyone
    who was listening in also learned a couple of new things. So yeah, thanks for
    joining us today.

  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you for having me. And thank you for the questions and sorry that we
    didn't get to all of them.
