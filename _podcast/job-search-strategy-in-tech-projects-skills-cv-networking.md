description: 'Learn a four-pillar tech job search: build portfolio projects, sharpen
  your resume and network strategically to land ML/data roles faster with outreach
  tactics.'
intro: 'How do you turn portfolio projects, a sharper resume, and targeted networking
  into a successful tech job search? In this episode Sarah Mestiri — Data Scientist
  and Certified Career & Interview Coach with 6+ years in tech across startups, international
  firms and financial services (FIS) — walks through a practical job search strategy
  for career changers and return-to-work professionals. Sarah outlines a four-pillar
  framework (goals, networking, CV, strategy) and shows how to define your ideal role,
  choose a specialization (ML engineering, data engineering, MLOps), and validate
  skills through projects versus courses. You’ll hear step-by-step advice on building
  a top-5 target company list, crafting personalized outreach and informational interview
  questions, and creating a weekly networking action plan that leverages weak ties
  and referrals. The episode also covers resume tactics — prioritizing projects, skills,
  and storytelling — self-research methods, assessments, part-time strategies, and
  age or career-change considerations. Listen for actionable takeaways: how to build
  portfolio projects that prove impact, write concise outreach messages, and structure
  a job search you can maintain — plus recommended resources and follow-up support
  (links and Slack) to help you execute.'

- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: Guest Introduction & Coaching Mission
- line: This week, we'll talk about accelerating the job hunt for the perfect job
    in tech. Today, we have a special guest, Sarah. Sarah is a data scientist and
    a certified career and interview coach. She has over six years of experience working
    in tech, working at international companies, financial companies, and startups.
    She went through a career transition herself and she also wants to support women
    (other women) in following their professional dreams.
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: That inspired her to become a certified career coach. She is on a mission
    to support more women to find the right job for them. As a career coach, she has
    been supporting women getting back to work after a career break, and women in
    transition to the data field. Today will probably talk more about that, and in
    general, about finding the perfect job. Welcome to our interview, Sarah.
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you, Alexey, for having me a guest on your channel. I'm very pleased
    to be part of it.
  sec: 232
  time: '3:52'
  who: Sarah
- header: 'Career Path: Computer Science, Full-Stack to Data Science'
- line: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for accepting the invite. The questions for today's interview
    were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks, Johanna, for your help. Let's start. Before
    we go into our main topic of finding a good job, let's start with your background.
    I already mentioned a couple of things but maybe you can tell us more about your
    career journeys so far?
  sec: 240
  time: '4:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, sure. I have a background in computer science engineering. I studied
    in Tunisia before moving to Berlin. I worked for a few years as a full stack developer
    before transitioning to data science, as you said – I made a career transition
    myself. Since 2018, I have been working as a data scientist at REMERGE, which
    is a company for mobile app retargeting. It helps people use mobile apps again
    by displaying ads.
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Sarah
- line: I have already worked in the ad tech space but correct me if I'm wrong. Let's
    say I play a game, and then something happens, and I forget about this game –
    I stop playing it. Then what you do is you see me in some other app and you say,
    “Hey, do you remember this game that you played? Come back!”
  sec: 313
  time: '5:13'
  who: Alexey
- header: AdTech Experience & Thriving Career Moms Project
- line: Exactly. Yeah, that's retargeting. That's the main area where REMERGE started.
    We also started user acquisition recently (last year). That's where I started
    in data science and still work at REMERGE. At the same time, after having my first
    child, I decided… I was like, “Okay, I want to do something during my parental
    leave,” and so on. Because I needed to find something for myself. That's where
    I started the journey into my own project, which is Thriving Career Moms, where
    I started helping moms returning to work after maternity. Then, until recently,
    I also started to support women in tech, or women in career transitions, so not
    necessarily only moms. Yeah, that's a little bit more. [chuckles] If you have
    a question about my journey, then [ask].
  sec: 339
  time: '5:39'
  who: Sarah
- header: 'Becoming a Career Coach: Community, Mentorship, First Mentees'
- line: How exactly did you realize, “Okay, not only do I want to help women get back
    to work after a break, but I’m also deciding to become a coach.”? What did you
    do? From the moment you realized, “Okay, I have some knowledge about that, and
    I want to share it,” to actually get in your first mentee? What was that journey
    like?
  sec: 405
  time: '6:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The secret there is – I have been having the support of a coach along
    my journey. When I decided to transition to data science, I joined a community.
    There, I got the support on how to go through my career transition. At the same
    time… Also, another time, when I decided to start my own project, I got the help
    of that same community, which is Classy Career Girl. I followed the steps. I was
    like, “I’ll take the first action and then – okay, here's some opportunity. Let
    me have a membership.” And then “Okay, not a membership. Let's do something else.”
    So I kept trying, doing different things, and with the support of my coach, through
    the support of my community, where I belong, I could really come up with a product
    or service and start career coaching and having my own mentees. Yeah.
  sec: 434
  time: '7:14'
  who: Sarah
- line: When it comes to figuring out what the niche where you can help is – at the
    beginning, did you already know what exactly you want to help with? Or was it
    something you needed to work out and understand and eventually…?
  sec: 498
  time: '8:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I understand.
  sec: 516
  time: '8:36'
  who: Sarah
- line: So you said “Okay, I want to help moms.” Right?
  sec: 518
  time: '8:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think that’s a process that I'm still going through, even today, because
    you keep [thinking], “Okay, now is this the right niche? Is this?” However, I
    knew that I wanted to support women from the beginning. For example, I want to
    support other women because I have my [challenges] from my own journey – I know
    that we face certain challenges. I feel called to support women. But then, okay,
    is it moms? Is it women in tech? Is it women transitioning to data? I'm still
    working on this step by step, with small steps. [chuckles]
  sec: 520
  time: '8:40'
  who: Sarah
- header: 'Client Profiles: Career Changers and Return-to-Work Support'
- line: What are the most common things that your clients come to you with? What kind
    of problems do they have that they need your help with?
  sec: 567
  time: '9:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Usually, they are looking for a new job or I also help those who started a
    new job – so they started a new job, but they don't have a specific goal. I supported
    them in the first month. But most of them are career changers and looking for
    a new job.
  sec: 582
  time: '9:42'
  who: Sarah
- line: Which is exactly the topic for today's interview.
  sec: 605
  time: '10:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah. We talked about that in our networking lunch. That's why the idea
    came forth. [chuckles]
  sec: 607
  time: '10:07'
  who: Sarah
- line: For those… There is a bit of a story. We met, I think it was in November,
    in Berlin. At DataTalks.Club, we have regular meetings – breakfasts, lunches,
    and dinners – and we met at one of these lunches (one of these meetings). Interestingly,
    along with Sarah, there was her client.
  sec: 616
  time: '10:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 642
  time: '10:42'
  who: Sarah
- line: '[chuckles] That, for me, was super interesting. That''s why we are talking
    [about that] right now. It took some time to arrange everything. It was a really
    interesting lunch.'
  sec: 643
  time: '10:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's also a career transfer to data.
  sec: 656
  time: '10:56'
  who: Sarah
- header: 'Four-Pillar Job Search Framework: Goals, Networking, CV, Strategy'
- line: Yeah. Clients come to you and ask you to help them with finding a new job.
    So what happens after you have the first call? How exactly do you help them to
    find this perfect job for their ambitions?
  sec: 659
  time: '10:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. So the way I help them is by taking them through the process, which
    consists of four pillars. The first pillar is about the job search, so helping
    them set clear goals about their ideal job description. We see jobs online, but
    which jobs are you really interested in doing? What problems are you interested
    in solving? What's your vision for the near future? That's the thing that we go
    through first. Then, it's about having a networking strategy and knowing which
    people you are going to reach out to, so that you increase your chances for a
    referral. [It helps you to] know about the right opportunities.
  sec: 679
  time: '11:19'
  who: Sarah
- line: Then, it's about the resume and interview preparation, which is about how
    to tailor your resume, how to use the correct keywords, and how to show the value
    that you provide to the company. Then, how can you express that in interviews?
    This means preparing for the top questions. For example, “Why are you applying
    to this company? What makes you interested in applying here? Why are you leaving
    your job? Why did you change your career?” And so on. Then, the fourth pillar
    is the job search strategy, which is about the main job search activities. That
    one is going to enter an early stage job.
  sec: 679
  time: '11:19'
  who: Sarah
- line: 'This sounds like it''s not really specific to data science—it applies to
    all sorts of jobs, right? [Sarah agrees] If we talk about data, this can be data
    analysts, data engineers, whatever, right? It''s very broad. Four pillars. Okay.
    You said the first pillar is job search… Okay, four pillars: job search, networking
    strategy, CV and interview preparation and job search strategy… [chuckles] Are
    the first and the last one the same?'
  sec: 796
  time: '13:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay. [chuckles] Let's… [chuckles] I’m just wondering, because I think those
    are the questions that… I don't know if you have the same document that I have,
    just because I remember that I changed it a little bit so we can really focus
    on the…
  sec: 831
  time: '13:51'
  who: Sarah
- line: Okay, I'm a bit… I’m not following the document. For those who edit this episode
    later, please cut this out. [chuckles] For those listening, bear with us. So,
    you prefer to follow the questions, right?
  sec: 855
  time: '14:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [chuckles]
  sec: 868
  time: '14:28'
  who: Sarah
- header: 'Defining Your Ideal Role: Tasks, Skills, and Future Vision'
- line: Yeah. Okay. So, we talked about these four pillars right. You said that the
    first thing is job search, right? You need to have a clear idea… You need to know
    what your ideal job is.
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first pillar is the job description, yeah. The ideal job.
  sec: 884
  time: '14:44'
  who: Sarah
- line: And which jobs are interesting for you – where you want to be in the future.
    So how do you know whether a job description is 100% aligned with my ambition?
    [How do you know whether] this job that I'm looking at right now is right for
    me?
  sec: 887
  time: '14:47'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Job Research: Role Analysis and Informational Interviews'
- line: I think that's one thing that all my clients who come to me think about. They
    know what they are looking for. For example, to be concrete, let's say I'm looking
    for a data scientist job. But then, data scientists can do many things, right?
    Even the titles are different. You can find for example, a “decision making scientist,”
    you can find an “applied research scientist,” and all of them can be put under
    “data science”. So, the first step that I help them to figure out is that and
    how to know whether this is the right alignment.
  sec: 907
  time: '15:07'
  who: Sarah
- line: '[We solve this] by knowing what skills you want to develop right now. You
    first go about this by researching. What we do is first research all these data
    science jobs. You look at an online advertisement, and then find some tasks that
    you enjoy – that you''re interested in doing. We start to collect them, “Okay,
    I like to do these tasks and these I don’t. I''m interested in learning about
    this technology, and not this technology.” This is part of researching the job
    description. But it’s not only that. The other thing is connecting with people
    who are [already] doing the job. So let''s say I found… the last time I found
    Flink, so that''s my example. [chuckles] Flink had a job advertisement for a data
    scientist, and I see whether there are any people that I can connect with who
    work at the company, or are currently working at Flink.'
  sec: 907
  time: '15:07'
  who: Sarah
- line: Then I can ask them, “How is it to work there? What do you do on a day-to-day
    basis? This helps to discover the alignment, exactly – by going through the process
    of researching, talking, and doing informational interviews. This is a strategy
    that I really like because it gives you another perspective. I used it myself
    when I was doing my career transition. Even as I look at how I want to grow further
    in my position, I do informational interviews with different people so that I
    can figure out what the thing that is right for me would be.
  sec: 907
  time: '15:07'
  who: Sarah
- line: I'm sidetracking a bit again.
  sec: 1067
  time: '17:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it's fine. [chuckles]
  sec: 1071
  time: '17:51'
  who: Sarah
- header: 'Choosing a Specialization: ML Engineering, Data Engineering, MLOps'
- line: I hope it’s fine. [chuckles] The problem that I personally have… Not me personally,
    but the problem that… Let me take a step back. In our community, we have courses.
    Right now we have three courses – three different courses – ML engineering course,
    data engineering course, and ML Ops course.
  sec: 1072
  time: '17:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: While the first and the last one are kind of similar, the data engineering
    course is quite different. It's a different kind of job, right? So people take
    all these courses – they take the data engineering course, the ML engineering
    course, and they say, “Okay, I like all the courses.”
  sec: 1072
  time: '17:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: All of them.
  sec: 1107
  time: '18:27'
  who: Sarah
- line: All of them.
  sec: 1109
  time: '18:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: What's the third? ML engineering, data engineering and the third?
  sec: 1110
  time: '18:30'
  who: Sarah
- line: ML Ops.
  sec: 1113
  time: '18:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: ML Ops, okay.
  sec: 1115
  time: '18:35'
  who: Sarah
- line: Then the students come and say, “We took the courses, and we like all of them.
    I want to do ALL of this stuff.” And this is a lot. You cannot… You can, but it's
    difficult to be a jack of all trades, right? Especially if you're on the start
    in your career. You need to figure out from these directions, where exactly you
    want to go.
  sec: 1116
  time: '18:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: What sometimes happens is, the students just apply to everything. They apply
    to data engineering positions, ML Ops positions, ML engineering positions – all
    of them. I am not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing. Maybe you can tell
    us. But I think one of the consequences of that is that you kind of lose focus,
    right?
  sec: 1116
  time: '18:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly.
  sec: 1164
  time: '19:24'
  who: Sarah
- line: So how, in this situation, when there are so many options… If I try to focus
    them, it means that I am kind of… How do I say this? Losing opportunities. I have
    this fear of missing out, that if I don't apply to data engineering positions,
    then there’s a very big chunk of potential jobs that I will not get, because I
    don't apply to them. Right? If I only apply to ML engineering positions. In this
    case, how can I actually understand which one is better, and what is better for
    me?
  sec: 1166
  time: '19:26'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Narrowing Focus: Aligning Skills, Interests, and Market Demand'
- line: Yeah. The first thing. Taking all the courses to explore is good because one
    doesn't have experience in the field, so exploring different specializations is
    a good way to start. But what I would suggest doing before starting the courses…
    I will talk about those who already did the courses. [chuckles] But before doing
    the courses and starting to apply for jobs – take some time and reflect on your
    profile. What skills do you have? What do you have as strengths? What do you have
    as qualifications, of course? Qualifications, strengths, skills – and then, what
    experience do you have? Taking all of these into consideration, in addition to
    them, your interests as well.
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Sarah
- line: This allows you to better leverage, “Okay, I have my profile. Now, which one
    of these – data engineering, ML Ops, or ML engineer – would be the one that works
    for me?” First, I would be applying the skills that I would enjoy, and I can become
    good at them because I enjoy doing this. Then I can become good at it. So which
    ones fit better based on my experience as well? So it’s a combination of your
    profile – what makes you unique? What makes you, you? And then, from there, let's
    research these positions. What does a data engineer do? What does ML Ops do? What
    does an ML engineer do? Once I do that, then I choose one of these. Now it's time
    to address, “Okay, but I'm not sure yet. I don't have much experience in it. All
    of them sound interesting. I want to work with data.”
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Sarah
- line: Many people say “I just want to work with data. I’m interested in working
    with data.” What I would advise them to do is to still try to choose a focus.
    Okay, choose a focus, but how do you choose it? Try to look at the job market.
    If all of them are interesting to you, then look at the job market. What does
    the job market say? Are they hiring data engineers more? Are they hiring more
    ML Ops? What's your target salary? The target environment? Study it from the point
    of the job market. This will help to filter. For example, “From those, it sounds
    like I like the data engineering [jobs], with my skills and my profile, what I
    want to do in the work environment, the job market, and so on – this one fits
    better.” From there, choose a focus. Now I want to answer the question of why
    a focus is not going to make you lose opportunities. Because when you focus, you
    simply give yourself the opportunity to grow your skills in that specific area.
    A mistake I made myself when I decided to change to data science – I have the
    background of a full stack developer and I worked with Java, I worked with backend,
    frontend… And I decided to move to Berlin.
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Sarah
- line: I knew I wanted to be in data science, but it still wasn't clear for me. Okay,
    data science, ML engineer, data scientist? It wasn't clear at that time to me.
    But what I did in the beginning was start applying for all jobs – full stack developer,
    back end developer, backend engineer, software engineer, data scientist, ML engineer…
    And I got overwhelmed with, “How can I prepare for the interviews for all of these?
    They have different requirements. A data scientist job would require other skills
    compared to a full-stack developer. A data engineer would require more skills
    than a data scientist. Although they can have intersection samples, the main focus
    would be different from data science data engineering [roles].” So I was getting
    lost. I was not getting any opportunities to have interviews – rejections, “What
    can I do?” and so on, until I narrowed down my focus. That's when I started to
    become more confident, more ready for the interviews. I could have a specific
    plan for learning. And I started to get interviews.
  sec: 1201
  time: '20:01'
  who: Sarah
- line: I narrowed it down, I was like “data scientist” and I also remember “ML engineer”.
    I kept it as a data scientist and ML engineer, for me. And that was my focus.
    The focus doesn't really reduce your chances. Yeah. [chuckles] And another thing.
    [chuckles] Another thing is that companies want some people that have experience.
    If you keep applying for all of these, in the end, you are applying for data engineer,
    ML engineer, data scientist, then the company who is hiring for a data engineer,
    which requires more infrastructure and tooling and preparation of the data workflow
    and so on – they will not find you having that practice of data engineering. Because
    you are trying to do all of them.

  who: Alexey

  sec: 1596
  time: '26:36'
  who: Sarah
- line: Then you have more focus from the very beginning and you know, “Okay, I want
    to focus on data engineering so I'll take data engineering.” Then, after the course,
    perhaps, instead of taking the other courses, focus on developing the skills in
    this area – focus on doing more projects in this area. [chuckles] And then get
    interviews in that area, and try to understand where you stand, what else is required
    to get the job. Hopefully, after finishing our course, you get all the skills.
    [Sarah agrees] But sometimes, some companies might require something specific
    that we don't cover. This is where you can understand that and then try to focus
    on building a project with this particular skill.
  sec: 1598
  time: '26:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's important not to get lost in doing all the courses. I don't know
    if all of them really do all the courses. Before starting a new course, just take
    some time. Maybe do a project. So, say I finished data engineering, and I do a
    project. I do a project and I see if I enjoy doing it. I suppose the hypothesis
    is something that I would like. Okay, I finished the data engineering [course],
    let me practice. Let me show that I developed skills in data engineering and then
    think about another course. But going from one course to another is… I don’t know
    the word. [chuckles] But it's better to avoid it. It’s like a circle – you get
    on the train, course after course after course, I feel like I still don't have
    enough qualifications. But remember, you also have skills, you have strengths,
    you have experience. So don't forget about that.
  sec: 1644

    to data science, it's such a broad topic that it can mean anything from analysts
    to hardcore deep learning whatever, right? When you read one job description for
    a data scientist, it can be super different from another description of a data
    scientist. It’s the same thing with data engineers.

  who: Alexey

    engineer that helps analysts, you can be a data engineer that works with data
    scientists – there are also specializations.[Sarah agrees] If I already know,
    “Okay, I want to do data science,” or, “I want to do data engineering.” Should
    I already have even more focus and think, “Okay, I want to focus on this particular
    type of data science job.”? Or is it okay to be rather broad at this point?

- header: 'Target Company Selection: Build a Top-5 Company List'
- line: Okay. Yeah. If you choose to focus on data engineering, there are different
    demands from company to company. Another thing that is in the first pillar that
    I've talked about, which is the job description, is not only getting a clear [understanding]
    about that job description and showing the things that you want to do, the title
    that you want (target titles), but also the companies. What are the companies
    that you want to work with? Choose the companies and see… The same thing – this
    is [what you get] by doing research – informational interview, researching. From
    there, you can come up with a list of, let's say, 5–10 companies maximum that
    you’re… I will say a list of five is enough, where you can say, “These are my
    top five companies that I want to work with.”
  sec: 1775

    the data scientists there? Can I network with them? Okay, let me get closer to
    know what they are doing (informational interviews) and see what problems they
    are trying to solve.” The team of data engineers, data scientists – or the company.
    Because every company shares its mission, its purpose, what they are doing, this
    is the product, and so on. So there is already a lot of information available
    publicly. Publicly, there is a lot of information available, so use that information
    in order to help you know what projects you need to practice. What are the problems
    that you need to practice solving and coming up with practical experience in those
    problems? And then, also networking with the people who worked at this company.
    Because that's another layer in the job search, which is networking. Does that
    answer your question?

    it's also something you do to realize what the perfect job for you is. Right?
    You know, “Okay, this is the area where I want to focus.” In order to do that,
    you mentioned these information interviews.

    these top five companies where I want to work. I opened LinkedIn. I say, ‘data
    scientists at Company X (REMERGE, whatever)’.” And then I see, “Okay, these are
    the people who work there.” What happens next? Do I just… They don't know me.
    I don't know them. What exactly is…
  sec: 1937
  time: '32:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: At first, especially for doing it the first time, it’s uncomfortable to do
    the informational interviews. Yeah, it's normal to feel uncomfortable. But think
    about the results – the outcome. The outcome of the informational interview gives
    you an idea, as I said, about what the company is doing, what the role is doing,
    and you can get advice. Now I have that goal. I'm up for it. This is a tool that
    will give me access to this information. But not only that, we have to know that
    people like to help others. They enjoy giving advice, helping others. I don't
    know – Alexey, do you like helping others? [chuckles]
  sec: 1963

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Or at least if you don't have time for lunch, you would say, “Okay,
    I can’t do lunch, but maybe we can have some time to talk.” People generally like
    to help, so to approach [them] for an informational interview, just be specific.
    Talk to the person. I reach out to the person, saying, “Hi.” Before reaching out
    to them, research that person. Research them on LinkedIn, I would say. Of course,
    that's the platform that we have. Do they have… [cross-talk]

    do share some things from their work, their interests, the things that they support
    — I mean, missions that they support – they blog about their tech stack or something
    like this. So research them and find something to connect with that person through
    – something about them, where you can tell them, for example, “I liked what you
    shared here,” or, “We come from the same (something).” Connect similarities.
  sec: 2058

  who: Sarah
- line: From that, say that you are currently looking for a job and working on your
    target companies or your target role and you are interested (you are considering)
    working at this company. You would like to hear from them, what advice would they
    give you, and how is it like to work at this company? I'd invite them for a short
    call, like 20 minutes, 15 minutes. Make it easy to say “Yes”. Lunch is good. [chuckles]
    If they say like, “Okay, let's do lunch.” But don't ask for lunch at the beginning.
    It's like, “15-20 minutes call or coffee?” And that's it. Make it easy to say
    “Yes”.
  sec: 2058
  time: '34:18'
  who: Sarah

    what kind of questions do I prepare in advance? Do I also send these questions
    in advance to that person? How do you go about the actual strategy?
  sec: 2153
  time: '35:53'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Key Informational Interview Questions: Day-to-Day & Success Factors'
- line: Okay. [chuckles] The strategy is — you don't send them the questions. Prepare
    your question. Don't send them the questions but prepare your questions. The questions
    could be… It depends. The informational interview can be used to know about the
    company or the role. So there are two things. If you want to know about the role,
    then focus your interview questions on the role. The questions could be like,
    “What do you do on a day-to-day basis? What do you find challenging in your job?
    What do you like in your job?” And then…
  sec: 2170
  time: '36:10'
  who: Sarah
- line: “What do you dislike?” Right?
  sec: 2214
  time: '36:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, “challenging”. I call it “challenging,” not “dislike,” but it could
    be “dislike." But another question that’s good is, “What would make a person successful
    in [this] role?” For example, “In your opinion, what would make a data engineer
    successful?” These are a few questions – four or five questions, because you only
    have 20 minutes to ask about the role. About the company would be something else,
    but similar, “What do you like about the company? What do you wish was different
    before you start? One improvement you want to see in the company?” So not only
    about what you like, what you dislike, but also deeper in questions.

    people asked me questions, and then I answered them. At the end, I get this question,
    “What can I help you with? What can I offer in return?” And my mind always goes
    blank. I don't know what to answer. [Sarah chuckles] I understand that, “Okay,
    they got something from me and they want to return the favor.” Right? [Sarah agrees]
    If I'm asking that person — I asked them questions, they already spent half an
    hour of my time. How can I figure out how I can be useful? Or I don't need to
    think about this?
  sec: 2272
  time: '37:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Just ask. “Is there anything I can do to help you as well?” Most often, they
    will say, “Oh, no, thank you.” But just be willing to help. When you have that
    informational interview, they get to know you a little bit. For example, I talked
    with someone for an informational interview to ask her about her role, and she
    knew that I'm a career coach. So when I asked her, “Okay, how can I help you?”
    She said, “Oh, I might need a career coach in the future. Let’s just stay in touch.
    Usually, this person will stay in touch – will connect with you on LinkedIn later,
    after this interview. That, on its own – later, they can ask you for help. So
    you don't have to return that help right away.
  sec: 2318
  time: '38:38'
  who: Sarah
- line: Be willing to offer it and know that you have not gained a new connection,
    a new relationship, that can benefit both sides in the future. Informational interview
    is not to ask about a job. It's not to ask, “Are you currently hiring? I want
    to apply.” They can suggest it themselves. I know my coach said because she was
    so prepared for her informational interview, that the person she interviewed told
    her, “If you want to apply, then tell me. I will refer you.” Don’t ask it explicitly,
    but it can happen.
  sec: 2318
  time: '38:38'
  who: Sarah
- line: Also, at this stage, I guess the purpose is to figure out what you want. [Sarah
    agrees] Maybe you don't even know if you actually want to be a data engineer at
    this particular company. When you ask them, “What do you not like about your job?”
    And then when you hear back what they say, you think, “Hmm.. Maybe, I’ll do [something
    else].”

    for you. Right?
  sec: 2456
  time: '40:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, but I said that you shouldn’t ask for a job because usually – even people
    who are watching right now and are currently in the job search – they will say,
    “Okay, I want to do something to get a job, not to learn about it.” [cross-talk]
  sec: 2465
  time: '41:05'
  who: Sarah
- header: 'Networking Action Plan: Weekly Outreach and Re-engagement'
- line: That’s the second pillar, right? The networking strategy. We kind of already
    started with networking. So we already reached out to people, we established these
    connections. But what about this networking strategy? Now I'm looking for a job.
    Now, I found that data engineering is the right job for me. I know the good things
    about this, I also know the challenges (the not-so-good things). And now I understand,
    “Okay, I think it's for me. Now I’ll start looking for a job.” So, when it comes
    to networking, how is it different from what we discussed?
  sec: 2477
  time: '41:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: How is it different? It's not about networking with just anyone, but networking
    with the right people. How do you know the right people? Who are the right people?
    Now you are clear on the job. I will suppose that you know the job, you know the
    companies that you want to work with. Now, who are the right companies? Based
    on that, I will find who the people I have to connect with are. But not only that
    – assess your network, your current network. Where are you underinvested? Where
    are you overinvested? Maybe you are connected to many people in another field,
    but not the data engineering field.
  sec: 2517
  time: '41:57'
  who: Sarah
- line: 'So, make an assessment of where you are overinvested or underinvested. From
    there, create a list of the people that you are going to reach out to and have
    a goal. For example, “Every week, reach out to five new people and connect to
    five people that you already know.” So networking is two things: new people and
    people that you already know. Why? Because actually, there is a research that
    was done a very long time ago by Harvard sociologist Mark Granovetter, who studied
    hundreds of professionals. They found that more than half of [subjects] learned
    about positions through personal contacts. And out of those who learned about
    the positions from personal contacts, only 16% of them saw that contact often.
    And more than 55% saw that contact only occasionally.'
  sec: 2517
  time: '41:57'
  who: Sarah
- line: This means the weak connections (people that you don't see that often, people
    that know you, but only occasionally) are actually… You can tap into them to know
    about the jobs. Because your strongest connections are probably in your same environment
    – in the same network. However, those weak connections can refer you to some new
    opportunities. That's why, as part of your plan, connect with the right people,
    new people, and as well, reach out to those people that you already know but haven't
    been in touch for so long. Share your story with them, what you are doing right
    now, and just connect with them and share with them. If they know anything, then
    ask them if they know any opportunity and ask them to share with you. Or have
    a chat, have coffee with them, connect with them again. Yeah. So that's part of
    the networking.

    10. I don't know if we will be able to cover all of them, but we can start. I'll
    start with the first question, “I left my job two years ago, and I started learning
    data science and Python. How should I put the things I learned in the CV and the
    projects I made in the CV?”
  sec: 2705
  time: '45:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay, I see that. “I left my job two years ago and started learning.” Okay,
    you can put them in because you left your job two years ago. Right now, you don't
    have current experience. So I would first put the skills in my resume. After the
    summary, I would put my skills, and then I would put my practical projects, and
    then experience – to make the projects the first thing that they see, the projects
    that you're doing. That's how I would recommend it.
  sec: 2731
  time: '45:31'
  who: Sarah
- line: Another thing that I did myself – because I also left my job when I transitioned
    into data science – instead of moving the section of practical projects, I kept
    the professional experience, but I added “My last job ended in this year, and
    from that time, I'm doing self-education.” So I put it in the professional experience
    as well. “Self-education, self-employment,” and I mentioned some of the projects
    that I did. That's also another way to do it. The goal here is to make it the
    first thing that they see, that, “I have experience in this field, and these are
    my projects.”
  sec: 2731
  time: '45:31'
  who: Sarah
- line: Thank you. Another question, “Do you know any service that can help with doing
    research – on companies, vacancies, and requirements?” I think this is what we
    talked about and you said, “You should come up with the top five companies that
    you think you will like. Then look at the job descriptions there and understand
    the requirements.” If I understand the question correctly, it asks if it’s possible
    to outsource that.

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Self-Research Methods: Company Analysis and Skill Matching'
- line: Yeah. [chuckles] Okay, that's not possible. You have to do it yourself. But
    I think what they're asking is about a service – maybe a platform where you can
    research a company. Anyway, this is something that you have to do yourself. Researching
    and where to go – you can research on LinkedIn, and you can research the companies
    themselves, the profile, the jobs that they have, the people that work there.
    Research could be a lot on LinkedIn itself – it's not only the company profile.
    The question here is to understand how your skills match the required ones.
  sec: 2852
  time: '47:32'
  who: Sarah
- line: When you research the company, you research them to find out what they are
    looking for and if you would like to work at these companies. This is one thing.
    Then, before, you also did the assessment of your skills. Once you select the
    companies yourself, you do the matching — you see, “Okay, there are some skills
    that I have, or these are some transferable skills.” This is manual work, actually.
    [chuckles] But what you can do is strength tests, for example, to know what your
    skills are. It's not part of the question, but in the assessment of your profile,
    there are resources to see your strengths, your interests. I can share the resources
    later. What do you suggest, Alexey? To share them later? The resources.

    Then, there are also the interests. One… I don't remember the name of the platform,
    but there are some platforms to help you with your skills – figuring out the skills
    and the strengths. Researching is on you. [chuckles]
  sec: 2958
  time: '49:18'

    searching for a part-time job? Should I apply for a full-time position and say,
    ‘Look, I only want to work half-time.’?” What's the strategy here? I imagine a
    situation where a mom wants to go back to work, but she still doesn't want to
    go full-time. This is a scenario where this situation can appear.
  sec: 3008
  time: '50:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's a personal choice. But there are some strategies. The first strategy
    which I found more recommended is to not say what you want in the beginning. For
    example, you saw a job that is full-time, but you are interested in working at
    this company. After researching the company, you can even apply spontaneously,
    by the way. Once you have the list of your companies, you can apply spontaneously.
    So this person likes to work at this company, but either full-time or there is
    no position. What you do is share your interest to work at this company, and then
    you can either tell them from the beginning “part-time,” or go to work full-time
    in the beginning.

  who: Sarah
- line: Then, once you prove yourself, then switch to part-time. That's the recommendation
    that I found when it's about full time. Because usually, when you say “part-time,”
    and it's full-time, they will say, “Oh, no. We are looking for a full-time position,”
    and it stops. So I wouldn't. If I applied for a full-time job at the first interview,
    I wouldn't say, “I like this job, but I want to work part-time.” At least in the
    advances – not from the first interview. I also know someone I helped from the
    beginning, she mentioned part-time. So it depends. How much is it a priority or
    how negotiable is it? But it's better to keep it full-time in the beginning.

  time: '50:40'
  who: Sarah
- line: I imagine that… If we talk about Germany – in Germany, the probation period
    is usually six months, so you’ll probably need to work full-time for at least
    six months, right? Before you can ask for a reduction in hours.
  sec: 3150
  time: '52:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I would say that during these six months that you’re working full time,
    if the company is flexible… Target specific companies that have the flexibility,
    that can give you the remote option, and then just focus on that. Then once you
    are either progressive in the interview, you can tell them… They are more interested
    in you because they think, “Okay, I want this person.” It's not like you said
    in the beginning. The flexibility can make full-time work easier. So it helps
    to experiment with that.

    like Alteryx and Tableau (a dashboard tool). Now I have time to study data engineering.
    I am 42 years old. Am I too old for the move?”

  who: Sarah
- line: It doesn't matter what age you are?
  sec: 3236
  time: '53:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: It doesn't matter. It's true, maybe there is some discrimination based on
    age, but legally and so on, your age is not an issue. You don't have to put it
    in your resume, by the way. [chuckles] Don't put your age in your resume, because
    it's personal information. From there, you can focus on showing that you practiced.
    You say, for example, “I have practice with Tableau and some other tools. I also
    studied data engineering.” So focus on that in your resume, in your LinkedIn profile.
    Show how you can already deliver value for the companies.
  sec: 3238
  time: '53:58'
  who: Sarah
- line: Because what do companies care about? “Is this person going to give me the
    results that I'm looking forward to?” So the return on investment. “I'm going
    to give you a salary. What can you give in return?” So focus on that. Move away
    from your age, experience, and so on, and focus on, “How can I show them that
    I can deliver them these results?” Once you show them how you can deliver the
    results, they don't care about your age. You can even use it to your benefit –
    if you have previous experience and so on (transferable skills) that can be beneficial.
    This can be an advantage.
  sec: 3238
  time: '53:58'
  who: Sarah
- line: If somebody in the company thinks that age is important to them, then maybe…
  sec: 3332

- header: 'Applying During Courses: Share Learnings and Build Visibility'
- line: There is a person who is currently taking our data engineering course. The
    question is, “Should I start applying for data engineer roles while I'm taking
    the course or after? I always feel like I'm not ready yet.”
  sec: 3358
  time: '55:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: So, “Should I start to apply while I'm doing the data engineering course or
    wait?” Okay. What I would advise doing is to start to share about your learnings.
    Whatever you learn in the course, during the course, share about it, try to practice
    it – small projects, small things that you can put on your GitHub profile. From
    there, maybe if you start applying… You can decide to apply after. If it's a career
    transition and you are in the course, then I would finish the course. During the
    course, I would start to have my marketing strategy – the last thing. So I would
    start to network with the people in data engineering, I start to share my learnings,
    and the challenges, and so on. Then, after I finished the course, I would start
    applying for jobs. But I already have my network ready, my marketing strategy
    ready. That's the difference, compared to someone who hasn't worked on the job
    search at all before finishing the course.
  sec: 3378
  time: '56:18'
  who: Sarah
- line: By the way, I did this myself. Because I was doing that when I was in the
    career transition to data science – I started a project on computer vision and
    I was learning. [I posted] “Okay, I faced this challenge.” on my personal website.
    “I faced these challenges.” And I was even talking about Visual Studio’s problems
    and how I changed them and so on. That helped me… It first helped some other people
    because I helped some other people. But that article that I wrote – I couldn't
    imagine that it would be referred to many times, because many people were facing
    the same problem and I helped them solve it. That was the first thing. And the
    second thing, because I was sharing what I was doing and learning, and the projects
    that I was working on, I got an opportunity. “Come talk about your projects that
    you're working on.” This already showed me results when I went through my transition.
  sec: 3378
  time: '56:18'
  who: Sarah
- line: Yeah, thanks for confirming that we are on the right track. In our courses,
    we encourage students/participants to share what they learn publicly. We even
    give them a bit of extra motivation. We score the homework and for each post they
    make on social networks, when they share something, they get extra points. Now
    you have an answer of why you should do that. [cross-talk]
  sec: 3516
  time: '58:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Don’t only set a goal like, “I have to share it to show other people.” If
    you frame the goal as, “Okay, let me help another person. Let me engage with people
    and learn from them.” Helping people who are not at that part yet, and engage
    with the people who are more experienced. Just make it as an experiment that you're
    doing with others. That's it.
  sec: 3552
  time: '59:12'
  who: Sarah
- line: Yeah. You'll be surprised how helpful it is, actually.
  sec: 3582
  time: '59:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [Helpful] for you and for others. Because when you try to talk about
    what you’ve learned on your project, you are making it easier for yourself later.
    At an interview, you will remember it better, because that helps you memorize.
  sec: 3586
  time: '59:46'
  who: Sarah
- line: So, this means that it's not just you writing a post on LinkedIn, “Hey, I
    learned Docker!” “Cool.” Actually write a post about what you learned, put it
    on some blogging platform, and then you share the post.
  sec: 3601

    is the best way to know the top five skills. I did it twice before.” We talked
    about that. You can use these sorts of tests to figure out your strengths. I think
    we should be wrapping up. Maybe, before we finish for the day, are there any resources,
    books, courses, YouTube videos, or whatever, that you can recommend for people
    to learn more about this topic?
  sec: 3626
  time: '1:00:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Thank you, Alexey. I just put a link for My Next Move. It’s a website
    where you can do the tests to see what your interests are. That's good because
    it helps guide you, for example, in terms of what industry you are going to be
    more interested in contributing to – also what roles. That is a good resource.
    Otherwise, I would recommend the book Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway by Susan
    Jeffers. Also, a book that helped me a lot is The Success Principles by Jack Canfield.
    Otherwise, it would be the podcasts Awesome at Your Job, DataTalks.Club, [chuckles]
    and Career Contessa, which is another podcast.
