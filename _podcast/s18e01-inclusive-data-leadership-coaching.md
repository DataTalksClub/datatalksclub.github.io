    \ leadership coaching. We have a special guest today, Tereza. This is not the\
    \ first time Tereza is here. We already interviewed her. Was it like two years\
    \ ago?"

  sec: 102
  time: '1:42'
  who: Tereza

  sec: 110
  time: '1:50'
  who: Tereza
- line: "It was a very insightful episode, where we talked about how you should read\
    \ job descriptions and what you can do about that. Check it out. If you go to\
    \ DataTalks.Club, there is a podcast section \u2013 and if you just look for Tereza\u2026\
    \ We haven't interviewed that many Terezas \u2013 only you, I think. So you'll\
    \ find that."

  who: Tereza
- line: Yeah, we will definitely do that. So Tereza coaches about leading with empathy.
    She has helped hundreds of people to level up their data career. This is what
    we'll talk about today. Welcome to the show.

- line: "Before we go into our main topic of data leadership coaching, let's start\
    \ with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far? Also,\
    \ maybe you can mention what changed in these two years \u2013 between our last\
    \ interview and today?"
  sec: 161
  time: '2:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Okay. Yeah, so my career background. I studied computer science, like many\
    \ people, maybe [chuckles] I don't know. No. [chuckles] I started computer science\
    \ and then I did a PhD in data science \u2013 very randomly. It wasn't called\
    \ data science back then. When I did it, it was called information retrieval and\
    \ natural language processing \u2013 long, long ago. Then I worked as a data scientist\
    \ at XING (the German LinkedIn). And then I worked at FREE NOW as almost everything:\
    \ data scientist, data engineer, product owner, senior data scientist, data science\
    \ lead, senior data science\u2026"

  time: '3:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Everything. And then, at the end of 2020, I switched to\u2026 I basically\
    \ needed a break from being responsible for product and I thought that I prefer\
    \ teaching other people to be responsible for products, so I can take a step back\
    \ and then recharge. So I joined Neuefische, where I first worked as a coach \u2013\
    \ just teaching other people data science, coaching people to switch and change\
    \ careers from anything they had (with or without background in data, with or\
    \ without background in industry) and basically leveling up or stepping into a\
    \ data career. That was like 2020 \u2013 so four years. Then I took over\u2026\
    \ Well, I built up the team. It was kind of a very ad hoc team before and then\
    \ I ended up leading the team and then, at some point, I kind of stopped coaching\
    \ people and just started just taking care of the team and growing the team. Then\
    \ we also merged with Spiced and then the team was huge and\u2026 Yeah. So that's\
    \ my background."
  sec: 224
  time: '3:44'
  who: Tereza
- line: "And then, last year, I studied\u2026 I noticed that there's kind of a little\
    \ gap in industry \u2013 more like a mindset that was bothering me. A lot of people\
    \ think, \u201COh, I know exactly how to become a senior data person. I just do\
    \ a lot of courses and I become a senior data person and then changing into leadership\
    \ is just like, \u2018get the role and then just do it.\u2019\u201D I mean, you\
    \ also see it in senior engineering \u2013 in a lot of companies, people are promoting\
    \ the next lead to be the most obvious senior in the team and then that senior\
    \ is like, \u201CI mean, I've learned stuff successfully before, how hard can\
    \ just doing it and learning on the job be?\u201D That's a lot of situations,\
    \ where you think about all sorts of, let's say, not optimal leadership \u2013\
    \ People thinking that just learning on the job is enough and not taking it seriously.\
    \ I don't think it's people's fault; I think it's the companies\u2019 fault. A\
    \ lot of companies are not really investing in their employees to\u2026 [cross-talk]"

  sec: 381

  who: Tereza
- line: "Because it\u2019s like, \u201COkay, now you have these responsibilities that\
    \ are completely different from what you were doing before and you're expected\
    \ to do well in them. So go figure this out.\u201D"
  sec: 384
  time: '6:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Because you\u2019ve done well before, right? I mean, how hard can it be?\
    \ It's like\u2026"
  sec: 395
  time: '6:35'
  who: Tereza
- line: Except now you don't do anything from what you've been doing before. The work
    is totally different.
  sec: 398
  time: '6:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. You were a good developer before and you could evaluate what it\
    \ means to be a good developer, and now you have to work with people, and you're\
    \ totally, like, \u201CHow do I even know if I'm good at this?\u201D [chuckles]\
    \ Nobody's telling us even that, you know? \u201CWhat does it mean to be good\
    \ at leadership?\u201D Or \u201CHow do I do it?\u201D So yeah, I think this is\
    \ more like a general mindset going on and some people are thinking, \u201COkay,\
    \ I should take this\u2026\u201D That's something I was writing at some point\
    \ that, in my opinion, switching into leadership from any kind of engineering\
    \ or data role is kind of like a career change. I think if we see it as a career\
    \ change, then we are investing in it like, \u201COkay, I'm a new learner. I'm\
    \ a new person. I\u2019ll get into it.\u201D So then I started offering coaching\
    \ \u2013 more like incognito. And then this year, it's less incognito. And, and\
    \ also providing\u2026 [cross-talk]"
  sec: 405
  time: '6:45'
  who: Tereza
- line: "What do you mean by incognito? Like you didn\u2019t officially announce on\
    \ LinkedIn or anywhere? [Tereza agrees] But people are still coming to you for\
    \ that."
  sec: 463
  time: '7:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. First, I did last year \u2013 I think I offered some free coaching\
    \ sessions in exchange for feedback. [This was] kind of to also understand what\
    \ kind of problems people have. I think I had two targets \u2013 there were the,\
    \ well, data leadership people who wanted to become better leaders. Again, this\
    \ is a point where I'd like to specify that, in my opinion, you don't need a leadership\
    \ title to want to be a good leader. I think leadership skills can help you in\
    \ your career\u2026 There comes a point in everybody's career, when you switch\
    \ from \u201CSomebody tells you everything that you have to do,\u201D to you figuring\
    \ out what you have to do. And that's like leadership skills."
  sec: 472
  time: '7:52'
  who: Tereza
- line: "I have a story about that. I remember when I was in the role of a Data Scientist\
    \ and when I had a problem \u2013 when they approached my manager \u2013 what\
    \ he told me was like, \u201CLook, you're a lead for a reason. And this reason\
    \ is you have to figure out this stuff on your own. I can help you, I'm always\
    \ here to support you. But like\u2026 I need a list of ideas from you. So come\
    \ up with this list, talk to people, see what they need, and then let's talk again\
    \ in a week.\u201D Something like that."
  sec: 524
  time: '8:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I mean, the higher you get in your career, whoever your manager is\
    \ will not really have so much time to have you on their mind 100%. [Alexey agrees]\
    \ And I think at some point, people really high up in their career, like the VP\
    \ and whatever \u2013 they don't even have one-on-ones anymore. There's nobody\
    \ who knows 100% what you're working on. So in order for someone to really help\
    \ you 100%, they need to be totally aware of your situation."
  sec: 555
  time: '9:15'
  who: Tereza
- line: "If you just have a one-on-one once a month for half an hour, and otherwise\
    \ you don't really see your manager that much \u2013 that's not enough time to\u2026\
    \ If you\u2019re going like that, just say, \u201CHey, I have this problem. What\
    \ should I do?\u201D You will just get an\u2026 and they go for helping you to\
    \ give you a solution \u2013 that solution is most likely to be super nonoptimal.\
    \ there'll be"
  sec: 555
  time: '9:15'
  who: Tereza
- line: Because like I have a totally different context, they're busy with other stuff,
    and they don't have time to really go deep into your problem and then give you
    advice. Right?
  sec: 614
  time: '10:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. And that can happen. I mean, it doesn't have to be that you're high\
    \ up in your career. It just has to be \u2013 you can be in a company where they're\
    \ bootstrapping everybody, and then you have a manager that is managing 15 people.\
    \ Everybody knows about the pizza (by the way, Death by Pizza [shows T-shirt]).\
    \ Everybody knows about the pizza \u2013 you should only manage a pizza that you\
    \ can eat, so seven, eight slices, and everything more than seven, eight people\
    \ that you are managing is supposed to be too large to do a good job \u2013 direct\
    \ reports, I mean."
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Tereza

  sec: 662
  time: '11:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "[laughs] Totally unrelated. I'm organizing this conference in Hamburg \u2013\
    \ Python Pizza Hamburg. And then I saw this T-shirt which was at a music festival\
    \ in Hamburg \u2013 Reeperbahn Festival. It's by an artist from Austria. And I\
    \ thought, \u201COh, I'm actually running the conference in a couple of weeks.\u201D\
    \ So I bought the T-shirt for the conference. This is usually what I wear at Python\
    \ Pizza. [chuckles]"

    \ All the talks are 10 minutes long. When you give a 10-minute talk, you actually\
    \ force people to just talk about one idea \u2013 one topic, and it's very focused.\
    \ Also, you can listen to a 10-minute talk, even if you don't like it, because\
    \ you know \u2013 it's over in 10 minutes. So you don't need\u2026 [cross-talk]"

  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. So I think the conference just happened in February also in Prague.\
    \ I think the Berlin people are going to bring it back this year to Berlin. Some\
    \ Berlin scene [people] might know it. It comes from Napoli actually \u2013 of\
    \ course. I mean, it does come from Italy. It\u2019s just imported. Yes."
  sec: 734
  time: '12:14'
  who: Tereza
- line: "Going back to your idea of \u201CYou cannot eat too much pizza \u2013 six,\
    \ seven slices at most. And the same with the team \u2013 you cannot manage more\
    \ than six, seven people at once.\u201D Right?"

    \ But then you kind of get sick."
  sec: 772
  time: '12:52'
  who: Tereza
- line: "How do you feel after that? Because every time I eat pizza\u2026 I don't\
    \ feel that it's enough for me. Right? And then I eat, eat, eat \u2013 until it's\
    \ super too much. [Tereza agrees] Just too much. And then like, \u201COkay, no.\
    \ It was too much.\u201D"
  sec: 778
  time: '12:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: "And that's the point. That's the same. Then the problem is that the next\
    \ day, you will not be able to eat pizza. You're gonna be like, \u201COh, I ate\
    \ enough pizza for the whole month now.\u201D [Alexey agrees] That's what happens\
    \ when you\u2026 you can manage a lot of people. I mean, that is not impossible,\
    \ but it's not sustainable. It's not sustainable for your own personal health.\
    \ And it's also not gonna be really good\u2026 Just like with pizza, right? I\
    \ mean, the first three slices are amazing and then the next slices start to be\
    \ like, \u201COkay, I've already eaten.\u201D That's why it's nice to go with\
    \ friends to eat pizza so you can swap slices from their pizza \u2013 just because\
    \ it gets boring, eating the same pizza. [chuckles] I don't know. It starts feeling\
    \ like you cannot put as much interest and effort and work into a slice (or a\
    \ person) to do a good job for that person, I think."

- header: Learning to figure things out on your own and how to receive feedback
- line: "So do you think we can learn these skills? If I'm a senior data scientist\
    \ and, all of a sudden, I find myself in this situation where I need to figure\
    \ out what to do without being told and I'm expected to actually not be told but\
    \ figure things out [on my own]. What's the most effective way of learning this?\
    \ You mentioned that, \u201COkay, I'm an engineer. I can figure this out as I\
    \ go.\u201D Which is what most people probably do. But this is not always the\
    \ best\u2026 the most optimal strategy. But is this the only strategy or can we\
    \ do it better?"
  sec: 854
  time: '14:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Well, the first step is to acknowledge that this is a completely new thing\
    \ that you have to learn. Maybe the same mechanisms that you were using before\
    \ to learn software development (or data and whatever) are not going to match\
    \ 100%. So I think there's [the first] part \u2013 you need to find some courses\
    \ that are really [specifically] for this \u2013 just as you read the book, did\
    \ some tutorials, and so on, for other stuff at some point in your career. This\
    \ is the same \u2013 be part of some conversations. Because it's important to\
    \ start having awareness.  At first, you're not really aware of the new scope\
    \ of problems that exist. It's just like\u2026 You don't even know they exist\
    \ because you've never had them before."
  sec: 896
  time: '14:56'
  who: Tereza
- line: "So it's not about always having the solution for everything or knowing how\
    \ to deal with it, but it's also opening up to this awareness that, \u201COkay,\
    \ this is a different kind [of problem]. This is a problem that can happen. It\
    \ has happened to other people. And then when I notice it, I know how to identify\
    \ that the problem is coming and what to do about it.\u201D And I think the second\
    \ thing is to work together with the team, and be transparent with the team that,\
    \ \u201CHey, look. I'm in a new role. It's completely new. And I will need your\
    \ help in order for us to succeed. In order to get your help, I don't want to\
    \ make a mistake over and over again and nobody feels safe to tell me about it.\
    \ Then I ended up having all bridges burned, and so on. So let's set up and build\
    \ up a feedback culture in the team.\u201D"

    \ then I apply the solution. And this is how my mind works most of the time. There's\
    \ a problem, there\u2019s a solution. But in the courses, they start talking about\

    \ This feedback training can be done once a year \u2013 you always get new people\
    \ in the team and it's just something that takes practice. It\u2019s just to bring\
    \ people awareness that, psychologically speaking, however people give you feedback,\

    \ The only thing that you can learn is how to react to something that is uncomfortable.\

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think one of the cornerstones is learning how to speak different work
    languages. How you talk to other data scientists is going to be different from
    how you talk to product people, and how you talk to engineers in another team
    and how you talk to sales and how you talk to the C-level and so on. And then
    it's also about listening. So practicing talking different languages, and also
    practicing active listening. With active listening, you start hearing what people
    actually have as a problem, or what they care about, what their own goals are,
    and what are their own perspectives. Then you can organize your message to fit
    that. You want to be able to communicate to the other person to the level that
    they will understand what you're saying. A lot of the time, our problems in communications
    are that we think communication is just about delivering a message. But actually,
    communication is about making sure that the other person understood the message
    the way we intended them to understand it. So that's a little bit more work.

    \ no value behind having a product owner. While holding this view on the world,\
