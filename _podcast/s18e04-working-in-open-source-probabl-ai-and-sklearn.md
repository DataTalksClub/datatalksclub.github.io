transcript:
- line: "This week, we'll talk about open source again. We have a very special guest,\
    \ Vincent, for the second time. This is not Vincent's first appearance. You were\
    \ one of the first guests on this podcast more than three years ago."
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Three to four years ago. Yeah, something like that."
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I was checking the previous podcast episode before we started, and it was\
    \ already season two. Season one had only five episodes, and you were one of the\
    \ first recordings of season two. We didn't have transcriptions back then, so\
    \ I had no idea what we talked about. But the topic was getting started with open\
    \ source. Today, we'll talk about open source again. Vincent, you come to mind\
    \ when I think about open source because of the numerous small libraries you've\
    \ created and discussed."
  sec: 123
  time: '2:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's not thousands, just to be clear."
  sec: 169
  time: '2:49'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Hundreds?"
  sec: 172
  time: '2:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's a small dozen, for sure. It is a bunch, but thousands is a lot."
  sec: 172
  time: '2:52'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Compared to the average person in the industry..."
  sec: 182
  time: '3:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's probably above average."
  sec: 189
  time: '3:09'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Maybe the 99th percentile?"
  sec: 191
  time: '3:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I did some research and found out I'm in the top 10 for open source contributions\
    \ on GitHub in the Netherlands. I knew three other people in that top 10. I'm\
    \ kind of up there, but not thousands."
  sec: 194
  time: '3:14'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Fair enough. That was the bio. I promised to improvise since we don't have\
    \ the bio in the show notes. You will tell us more."
  sec: 226
  time: '3:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Sure. Thanks for the lovely intro."
  sec: 237
  time: '3:57'
  who: Vincent
- header: "Vincent’s Background"
- line: "Thanks for being here. Before we start, I want to shout out to Johanna Bayer\
    \ for preparing today's interview questions. Thanks, Johanna. The reason we're\
    \ speaking today is because she met you at a conference, correct?"
  sec: 240
  time: '4:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, at a PyLadies Code Sprint. There were many projects, and I was there\
    \ on behalf of Scikit-Learn to help people get their first PR in. Johanna was\
    \ in my Scikit-Learn bubble doing docs work and then asked if I wanted to come\
    \ on this podcast. I recognized the logo and agreed to return. A few years ago,\
    \ we talked about Scikit Lego, one of the projects we discussed."
  sec: 259
  time: '4:19'
  who: Vincent
- line: "That project played a role in getting me my current job. Scikit Lego consists\
    \ of Lego-like bricks I built using Scikit-Learn tricks. It started as a side\
    \ project but now has around 30,000 downloads a month and is in production in\
    \ many places. It's one reason the Scikit-Learn core maintainers thought having\
    \ me at the company would be useful. I initially thought it was just a cute plugin,\
    \ but it turned out to be significant during my job interview."
  sec: 259
  time: '4:19'
  who: Vincent
- line: "We usually start our interviews with your background. Can you talk about\
    \ your career journey so far?"
  sec: 348
  time: '5:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Sure. I studied econometrics and operations research, which is quite math-heavy.\
    \ Around graduation, I discovered machine learning and wanted to try it out.\
    \ I decided to backpack while taking some client programming work with me. I\
    \ found programming as enjoyable as clubbing, which signaled me to pivot my career\
    \ towards tech instead of being a consultant."
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I did tech consulting for a while before getting a job offer from Rasa as\
    \ a Developer Advocate. I hadn't heard of that role before, but it sounded interesting\
    \ as a gateway to NLP. The consultancy I was at didn't offer NLP opportunities,\
    \ so I switched."
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I was a big fan of spaCy, and two years after working at Rasa, Explosion\
    \ AI (the creators of spaCy) hired me as a Developer Advocate and Core Developer\
    \ on their Prodigy product. I did Developer Relations and core development there\
    \ for two years. Eventually, I joined some Scikit-Learn core maintainers starting\
    \ a company called :probabl., and that ball got rolling quickly."
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Now I do open source work and Developer Relations at :probabl. That's a\
    \ quick summary of my career. Along the way, I've organized conferences and meetups\
    \ and built several open source projects."
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Vincent
- line: "How what?"
  sec: 481
  time: '8:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That's an American saying, 'That's how the cookie crumbles.'"
  sec: 483
  time: '8:03'
  who: Vincent
- line: "What does that mean?"
  sec: 486
  time: '8:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's similar to 'Bob's your uncle,' meaning 'That's the short story.' A\
    \ cookie crumbles in one way; the crumbs fall down and never split in other directions.\
    \ It's an American saying. Sayings are weird. [chuckles]"
  sec: 488
  time: '8:08'
  who: Vincent
- header: "Scikit-Learn’s History and Company Formation"
- line: "There are companies behind open source products that typically don't share\
    \ the same name. For example, Explosion AI created spaCy, and :probabl. is associated\
    \ with Scikit-Learn. Why didn't they just name it Scikit-Learn?"
  sec: 513
  time: '8:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Rasa has 'Rasa' in their product name. Some companies do that."
  sec: 533
  time: '8:53'
  who: Vincent
- line: "They do. So, why not name it Scikit-Learn instead of :probabl.?"
  sec: 536
  time: '8:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: "In :probabl.'s case, Scikit-Learn is a huge project with a vast community.\
    \ Some core maintainers work at :probabl., but the company is not Scikit-Learn.\
    \ There's a distinction."
  sec: 544
  time: '9:04'
  who: Vincent
- line: "You could say :probabl. acts as a brand operator. We intend to hire many\
    \ open source maintainers to work on this, but it's a larger community. Claiming\
    \ the name for a company wouldn't make sense."
  sec: 562
  time: '9:22'
  who: Vincent
- line: "And Explosion does spaCy but also other stuff."
  sec: 580
  time: '9:40'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Prodigy, right?"
  sec: 585
  time: '9:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. Naming your company after your open source project limits you to that\
    \ project. :probabl. will likely do more than just Scikit-Learn. We might offer\
    \ training, consultancy, and possibly other products. There are many reasons\
    \ not to call ourselves Scikit-Learn."
  sec: 586
  time: '9:46'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Also, the legal aspect. Scikit-Learn is a name that already exists. It's\
    \ probably registered and trademarked, so we can't use it."
  sec: 586
  time: '9:

46'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I'm checking the Scikit-Learn website. I don't see any trademark, but it\
    \ probably belongs to NumFOCUS or another organization."
  sec: 628
  time: '10:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "To my knowledge, it's its own entity. NumFOCUS is an umbrella for funding\
    \ some open source projects. There are NumFOCUS projects and 'associated' projects.\
    \ I believe Scikit-Learn is an associated project."
  sec: 639
  time: '10:39'
  who: Vincent
- line: "So NumPy is a NumFOCUS project, and Scikit-Learn is only associated?"
  sec: 664
  time: '11:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That's my understanding. These distinctions matter because Scikit-Learn\
    \ has been a large community for decades. It's not something a company can just\
    \ claim."
  sec: 670
  time: '11:10'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Before that, the creator originally... It originated from Inria, the research\
    \ lab in France. What's the story there?"
  sec: 695
  time: '11:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I know parts of it. The original version may have started as a Google Summer\
    \ of Code project. Inria played a significant role in its maintenance, with several\
    \ people working on Scikit-Learn and writing papers. Companies also sponsored\
    \ developers. For example, Andreas Müller was supported by NYU for his work on\
    \ Scikit-Learn."
  sec: 710
  time: '11:50'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Microsoft has a similar arrangement now. Companies like Quansight Labs provide\
    \ consulting and contribute PRs. It's beneficial for companies to have core developers\
    \ on their team."
  sec: 710
  time: '11:50'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Like Scikit Lego."
  sec: 804
  time: '13:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, and projects like UMAP. If you want to use the UMAP clustering visualization\
    \ algorithm, you need to install it as a Scikit-Learn plugin. Many projects like\
    \ it are valuable to the ecosystem."
  sec: 806
  time: '13:26'
  who: Vincent
- header: "Maintaining and Transitioning Open Source Projects"
- line: "Contributing something new to Scikit-Learn is difficult because maintainers\
    \ are cautious about maintaining new methods. It's easier to create a plugin\
    \ that follows the API and is maintained separately."
  sec: 841
  time: '14:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: "There are concerns beyond maintenance, such as benchmarking and quality.\
    \ Scikit-Learn is seen as an example to follow, so what's included should be\
    \ high quality. Some core algorithms are kept for historical reasons, but not\
    \ every new paper can be included, or it would become unmanageable."
  sec: 875
  time: '14:35'
  who: Vincent
- line: "UMAP isn't in Scikit-Learn because it relies on 'numba,' an LLVM compiler\
    \ trick to speed up Python code. Introducing new dependencies can be an issue.\
    \ Scikit Lego, which I helped maintain, looks at Scikit-Learn issues and implements\
    \ fun and useful features that Scikit-Learn can't include."
  sec: 875
  time: '14:35'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Scikit Lego is fun and useful for maintainers. It's not taken as seriously\
    \ as Scikit-Learn, but it allows for experimentation and implementation of features\
    \ that Scikit-Learn can't include."
  sec: 875
  time: '14:35'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Can you tell us more about Scikit Lego? How did maintaining this library\
    \ lead to working at :probabl.?"
  sec: 1003
  time: '16:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "As a consultant, I noticed the need for reusable components for tasks like\
    \ selecting columns from pandas. Instead of re-implementing the same thing repeatedly,\
    \ I created a collection of Lego bricks. A colleague and I used these components\
    \ for training and teaching open source, making it a utility for corporate training."
  sec: 1013
  time: '16:53'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Using Scikit Lego for corporate training helped me get contributors. Offering\
    \ students the chance to commit to open source as part of their lesson was a win-win,\
    \ making the library better while helping them learn."
  sec: 1013
  time: '16:53'
  who: Vincent
- line: "That's smart."
  sec: 1089
  time: '18:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's enjoyable and beneficial. As time went on, I used the library less,\
    \ so we looked for a new maintainer. Francesco volunteered, and his fresh perspective\
    \ and enthusiasm improved the project."
  sec: 1091
  time: '18:11'
  who: Vincent
- line: "At PyData Amsterdam, I told people we were looking for a new maintainer\
    \ who actually uses the library. Francesco had already contributed and expressed\
    \ interest, so we discussed it further."
  sec: 1142
  time: '19:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Francesco uses Scikit Lego at work, which makes him a great maintainer.\
    \ He adds features and enjoys maintaining the library, which is crucial for its\
    \ sustainability."
  sec: 1153
  time: '19:13'
  who: Vincent
- line: "You approached people at the conference, asking if they wanted to maintain\
    \ the library?"
  sec: 1202
  time: '20:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, but it was more about finding someone who uses it. Francesco had already\
    \ shown interest and made contributions. Meeting in person at the conference\
    \ solidified it."
  sec: 1217
  time: '20:17'
  who: Vincent
- line: "And he uses Scikit Lego at work, right?"
  sec: 1263
  time: '21:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, though some details are private. He finds the library useful and fun,\
    \ which aligns with our goal of maintaining it as a fun project."
  sec: 1268

- header: "Teaching and Learning Through Open Source"
- line: "How do you make a library fun to maintain?"
  sec: 1309
  time: '21:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: "We celebrate that it's volunteer work. We encourage implementing features\
    \ if they're in someone's domain or sound fun. We require benchmarks to confirm\
    \ improvements. If it's not fun, it won't be maintained."
  sec: 1311
  time: '21:51'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I have a child now, so I won't spend my evenings on uninteresting tasks.\
    \ Francesco's fresh perspective and ideas keep the project enjoyable for both\
    \ of us. He would make a great podcast guest to share his perspective."

- line: "You told us about Scikit Lego. How did it lead to your current job?"
  sec: 1409
  time: '23:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: "The Scikit-Learn maintainer group was looking for someone who could clearly\
    \ explain data science and machine learning without the hype. My resume, including\
    \ Scikit Lego, showed I took testing and quality seriously, which helped in the\
    \ interview process."
  sec: 1424
  time: '23:44'
  who: Vincent
- line: "The technical interview was lightweight because they could see my work\
    \ with Scikit Lego. Other factors, like conference talks and keynotes, also helped.\
    \ Maintaining Scikit Lego showcased my dedication to open source and quality."
  sec: 1424
  time: '23:44'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I was talking about thousands of small open source libraries and you said,\
    \ 'It's not true.' But when it comes to your talks, I searched your name on YouTube..."

- line: "I'm a frequent speaker at PyData. During COVID, I started

 Calm Code, a tutorial\
    \ website as an alternative to DataCamp. I didn't like their approach of pushing\
    \ future-proof skills. Calm Code focuses on learning tricks to make your day-to-day\
    \ work easier."
  sec: 1546
  time: '25:46'
  who: Vincent
- line: "That’s why it’s 'calm' – no pressure to learn things. You can learn whatever\
    \ you want."
  sec: 1597
  time: '26:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, just useful tips to improve your workflow. Making over 700 videos\
    \ for Calm Code helped me practice clear communication. Creating videos is now\
    \ like writing a FOR loop for me."
  sec: 1604

  who: Vincent
- line: "Also, counting all your work as a Dev Advocate at Rasa, Explosion, right?"
  sec: 1650
  time: '27:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. At Rasa, I made around 100 videos. At Explosion, I made fewer but\
    \ more polished videos. With experience, recording videos became easier. The\
    \ challenge now is coming up with good examples and insights."
  sec: 1659

  who: Vincent
- line: "Coming up with examples is the most difficult part, right?"
  sec: 1708
  time: '28:28'
