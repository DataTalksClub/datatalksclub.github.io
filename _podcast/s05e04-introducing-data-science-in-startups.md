- header: "Marianna\u2019s background"
- line: We have a special guest today, Marianna. Marianna is a data scientist at Restream,
    and the data science lead and mentor in the local branch of Women Who Code community
    in Kiev. Before Restream, she worked at Data Robot and she also led the data science
    team in a fintech startup. Welcome. Before we go into our main topic, let's start
    with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 2
  time: 0:02
  who: Alexey
- line: "I wouldn't say that it was super straightforward. This happens for some data\
    \ scientists, because they usually have just two ways, either coming from a research\
    \ background or from a software development background. I used to be a Java developer\
    \ and I just got interested in the field. Thanks to the Women Who Code community\
    \ I also met real data scientists who were doing work in production. Five years\
    \ ago, it wasn't that popular, so it wasn't that easy to find such people. The\
    \ community really helped me to find a mentor. That's how I started studying a\
    \ lot. Then I got my first job in a startup. I will probably be referencing that\
    \ today, because this is basically the place where I got the experience of leading\
    \ a team. After that, I worked in Data Robot, which allowed me to compare what\
    \ it's like to work in a small startup in comparison to working in a company that\u2019\
    s closer to a large enterprise. Right now I\u2019m in Restream, which is also\
    \ a startup. All the experience that I got over the years, I will try to apply\
    \ here, right now."

  who: Marianna
- line: Okay, so when did you switch to data science? Was it five years ago?
  sec: 132
  time: '2:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 137
  time: '2:17'
  who: Marianna
- line: This is when you joined the Women Who Code branch?
  sec: 138
  time: '2:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 143
  time: '2:23'
  who: Marianna
- line: It was at the same time?
  sec: 145
  time: '2:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, pretty much.
  sec: 146
  time: '2:26'
  who: Marianna
- line: Were you the first data scientist at your first startup?
  sec: 148
  time: '2:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No, there were several other data scientists there. It was a fintech startup\
    \ and I was lucky with that because now I have more experience and have reviews\
    \ and stuff like that. But unfortunately, it didn\u2019t last long. A lot of things\
    \ changed in the company. The careers and lives of my former colleagues also changed.\
    \ I think after less than a year, I was the only data scientist. That's how I\
    \ got into trying to organize everything myself and tried to hire a team, which\
    \ was interesting since I didn't really have much technical experience back then.\
    \ But I was the only person who knew the product quite well. Even if they hired\
    \ someone else, this person wouldn\u2019t know that much about the company and\
    \ its product. It was really challenging, but it gave me quite a lot in terms\
    \ of experience."
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Marianna
- header: Being the only data scientist
- line: What are the pros and cons of starting as a first data scientist with a company?
  sec: 222
  time: '3:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I would say it's a bit subjective. But maybe the best thing is having freedom\
    \ in terms of what you can do. You don't have limitations \u2013 you're not limited\
    \ by the technologies that you use, you're not limited by methodologies. For example,\
    \ in Data Robot, there are really strict guidelines and processes that are in\
    \ place for the projects. Compared to startups where you can basically come up\
    \ with some idea that we can implement really fast and control execution. So it\
    \ doesn't really take you that much to go through all that, as it happens inside\
    \ of big companies when you need to get all the needed approvals and stuff."
  sec: 228
  time: '3:48'
  who: Marianna
- line: "Also, you have more influence \u2013 people listen to your opinion more.\
    \ If you're working in a big company, there are a lot of data scientists and you're\
    \ probably working on some specific projects. But when you're the only one, you're\
    \ basically responsible for everything related to data science in the company\
    \ until they hire a bigger team. It also seems to me that startups have a healthy\
    \ work culture \u2013 deadlines can be more realistic because you kind of set\
    \ them yourself. Of course, you discuss it with your colleagues, but still. It's\
    \ not like you have a strict process and you're not pressured in terms of that."
  who: Marianna
- line: "I think that in terms of disadvantages, you have more responsibility when\
    \ you\u2019re alone than when working in a team. You're not just given responsibility\
    \ for your model, but for everything that\u2019s happening in the company. In\
    \ the first startup where I worked, I was basically responsible for everything\
    \ related to analytics. However, if it was dashboards some various other teams\
    \ helped me. It's quite a huge role, I would say. Because of that, you had to\
    \ learn a lot on the way. Again, you don't have anyone near you, where you can\
    \ just ask. I would say that that's both good and bad."
  who: Marianna
- line: "It\u2019s bad in the way that you have this pressure that you need to learn\
    \ a lot and you have to somehow validate yourself \u2013 whether you\u2019re doing\
    \ the right thing or not. At the same time, if you have someone to ask, you can\
    \ get unmotivated to learn. At least that\u2019s how it works for me. I developed\
    \ faster as a professional than when I have less support from my colleagues. I\
    \ don't know how it works, but sometimes you kind of feel that when you have someone\
    \ to ask something, you start relying more on that than learning stuff by yourself."
  who: Marianna
- line: "Basically, it forces you to learn more than you would otherwise learn with\
    \ your colleagues. That\u2019s interesting. I actually observed something similar\
    \ when I worked at a startup. Even though I had colleagues who worked as data\
    \ scientists, I think when there's a small team, compared to a bigger team, it\
    \ kind of forces you to really do a lot of stuff that otherwise you maybe wouldn't\
    \ do."
  sec: 433
  time: '7:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "You\u2019re just focusing on just one specific project and you think, \u201C\
    Okay, I don't know this. I\u2019ll just ask the person how to do that because\
    \ I need to do that faster with some plans for the team and deadlines and stuff.\u201D\
    \ As occasionally happens, sometimes we just never get to learn that ourselves."
  sec: 468
  time: '7:48'
  who: Marianna
- header: What should already be in the company
- line: Say somebody wants to join a company that doesn't have any data scientists
    yet and they want to join as the only data scientist. What kind of things should
    companies have for you to feel comfortable in joining this startup? Are there
    any prerequisites or can you just go to any startup and start working as a data
    scientist?
  sec: 493
  time: '8:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I would say that it would be great if the company had some kind of existing\
    \ pipelines and infrastructure, as well as people who are supporting them \u2013\
    \ either data engineers or DevOps developers, depending on the company\u2019s\
    \ policies. I've had experience with that. In Restream, there is already established\
    \ infrastructure and people can do analytics. In comparison to that, when I first\
    \ started working there was basically nothing. There was some data gathering,\
    \ but sometimes it was bad data and you couldn\u2019t use it. Because of that,\
    \ it was really complicated to work. It may have seemed like you had a lot of\
    \ data, but you actually didn't, because you couldn\u2019t use it all. That's\
    \ why I would say that it's important to have something that exists already. Also,\
    \ it\u2019s probably important to have some kind of analytics department. As I\
    \ mentioned, in my first job in a startup, there was no one doing analytics before\
    \ me. When you have a huge scope of stuff you can do with data science, plus you\
    \ have a lot of stuff that you can do with analytics \u2013 helping different\
    \ teams and stuff. But it's too much for one person, for sure. Usually, all of\
    \ these things are of high priority. It\u2019s going to be hard to do all that\
    \ at the same time. You can\u2019t."
  sec: 522
  time: '8:42'
  who: Marianna
- line: Basically, companies should ideally have data engineers and data pipelines.
    They should also have analysts. Otherwise, you as a data scientist might end up
    doing all this work in addition to trying to do data science. But without having
    the data, you probably cannot really do data science. So you will first need to
    spend a lot of time on building all these things. Right?
  sec: 625
  time: '10:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 652
  time: '10:52'
  who: Marianna
- header: How much experience do you need
- line: How much experience would I need to have in order to join a company as the
    only data scientist? Do I need to be very experienced, like a senior person? Or
    if I'm just switching careers, would it be a good idea to join such a company?
  sec: 653
  time: '10:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it should be more like middle-senior level. The most important thing,
    at least for me, is being able to create a project from scratch and go through
    all the needed phases. Not just for model training, but you should be able to
    define the problem. If you don't have enough data, you should be able to somehow
    translate what other people mean, when you talk with people who don't really know
    data science. Also, you probably should be able to deploy a model and monitor
    it. Basically, it's a huge scope of work, I would say. Not everyone has this kind
    of experience because often they just get to work on one specific stage. You need
    experience with that, or at least the motivation to do that, and the motivation
    to do a lot by yourself. It's something that a data scientist should have if he
    or she wants to be the only one in the company.
  sec: 675
  time: '11:15'
  who: Marianna
- line: "Even though there are data engineers and even though there are analysts already\
    \ in the company, you still need to do a lot of communication \u2013 working with\
    \ others to define a problem \u2013 and then actually training a model. Then after\
    \ that, you also need to be able to deploy it. So you need to be able to do the\
    \ whole thing, from the beginning to end. Is that right?"
  sec: 734
  time: '12:14'
  who: Alexey
- header: Identifying problems
- line: Yeah, I would say it always starts from defining if there is actually a problem
    that needs solving. People usually don't really exist in this context of the data
    science problems and they have a very different understanding of how the field
    works, and what we can do with the tools that we have. Basically, it's always
    about identifying whether there is a model needed. Maybe it shouldn't even be
    worked through, or maybe another problem needs more attention.
  sec: 753
  time: '12:33'
  who: Marianna
- line: How do you do that?
  sec: 784
  time: '13:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I'd say it takes experience. Although I'm an introverted person, it was hard\
    \ for me to learn not to be like that, it really takes a lot of communication.\
    \ Especially with people who are close to the business side of the product. For\
    \ example, if it\u2019s the analytics department, it's really helpful because\
    \ analysts usually know quite a lot about different parts of the product. They\
    \ also already help different teams, so they know more about that company. But\
    \ usually, I try to communicate with all the departments. Sometimes, especially\
    \ when you don't have data scientist colleagues or you have different people with\
    \ different backgrounds, I really listen to their experiences and their challenges,\
    \ and I kind of automatically just translate it into the language of data science\
    \ and try to understand how their problems can be solved."
  sec: 789
  time: '13:09'
  who: Marianna
- line: How does it usually happen? Do others come to you with their problems or you
    need to practically find problems that can be solved with data science?
  sec: 854
  time: '14:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I would say that it depends on the company. Usually, when the first data\
    \ scientist is hired there is already some understanding that he or she is supposed\
    \ to solve some problem. Sometimes it\u2019s more like, \u201CWe have a lot of\
    \ data. Maybe we should do something about it but we don't know if we should.\u201D\
    \ So it depends on the company. When I started at Restream, for example, I had\
    \ more specific requests and I had several ideas to explore, which were \u201C\
    What has more priority? What is more feasible?\u201D That's basically how I started\
    \ working. At first, it's important to talk more about what you can do, because\
    \ people can't just come to you if they don't know what you're doing and how you\
    \ can be helpful."
  sec: 865
  time: '14:25'
  who: Marianna
- line: "First, practice reaching out to other people. That's what basically I did\
    \ \u2013 organized different meetings with all the departments and talked about\
    \ their challenges and problems and tried to explain how I can be helpful. Now\
    \ it's more like people come to me instead of me trying to find something to solve.\
    \ But I also try to always think about some kind of roadmap or plan and discuss\
    \ it with other people and see if they think that would be helpful or not. I think\
    \ it's also important."
  who: Marianna
- header: Prioritization
- line: "I can imagine if you talk to many people from different departments and from\
    \ different teams, maybe half of them or all of them have problems. Then you have\
    \ a problem that you have too many problems to solve. So that's why you need the\
    \ roadmap, right? You need to be able to identify, \u201COkay, out of these 10\
    \ problems, what is the most impactful one?\u201D Or \u201CWhat is the easiest\
    \ to solve?\u201D Right?"
  sec: 961
  time: '16:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Feasibility, priority \u2013 you also need to discuss these things.\
    \ The people who are my supervisors, what do they think? That's how I basically\
    \ decide what is more important."
  sec: 990
  time: '16:30'
  who: Marianna
- line: "So you just ask \u201CHey, on a scale from one to ten, how important is this?\u201D\
    \ How do you understand what is more important and what is less?"
  sec: 1002
  time: '16:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's more like I discuss it. For example, I\u2019m basically a part of the\
    \ business analytics department and I just ask the lead of this department what\
    \ they think is more important right now. He's always in touch with all these\
    \ people and has been working in the company for many years already. I can chat\
    \ with him or with someone else, like the head of product and people like that,\
    \ and hear different opinions. That's how I decide that something has more priority\
    \ right now."
  sec: 1014
  time: '16:54'
  who: Marianna
- line: I am not sure I got the part about you. When you joined Restream, did you
    already know what kind of problems you would be working on? Or did you have to
    figure that out on the job?
  sec: 1052
  time: '17:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I already had a vague understanding of what it could be. At first, I thought\
    \ that it could be a lot like one thing, but then they switched over to another.\
    \ So there\u2019s also work for marketing right now. Also, some of the problems\
    \ we initially discussed in the beginning turned out to be not so important right\
    \ now \u2013 they moved on to something else. I would say that they had an initial\
    \ request when I joined the team, but it got clearer over time."
  sec: 1066
  time: '17:46'
  who: Marianna
- header: What should the company already know?
- line: "So basically, a company should already have an idea of what they want. They\
    \ should have some problem that potentially can be solved with data science and\
    \ not like, \u201COkay, we have these 10 terabytes of data or ten petabytes of\
    \ data. Now, we need to figure out what to do with all this information.\u201D\
    \ There should be something more or less already there \u2013 not super specific,\
    \ but at least some idea. \u201COkay, look at this problem. This can be solved\
    \ with data science.\u201D Right?"
  sec: 1107
  time: '18:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, I also think that even if a company doesn't really know what they want\
    \ to solve, they can have some kind of consulting done before that. Because it's\
    \ not like they all know about this complex data analysis, and they don\u2019\
    t necessarily know what they can do with that. It's completely fine not to know,\
    \ but both hiring and not knowing and also expecting a lot from the person isn\u2019\
    t a good idea. I\u2019ve run into companies that see data science as kind of a\
    \ magic pill that will be able to solve everything that's currently happening\
    \ in the company. However, it's more a part of one big process and it changes."
  sec: 1134
  time: '18:54'
  who: Marianna
- line: "Basically, the ideal situation is when a company already had consultants\
    \ who explained to them what could be done, what could not be done. That potentially\
    \ for this problem, data science is a good solution and they should hire data\
    \ scientists. This is probably a good situation because the company already has\
    \ some processes in place. They have some ideas \u2013 even though they may be\
    \ vague ideas \u2013 of what could be done with data science. That's probably\
    \ the ideal case, right? If they already have some data pipelines and an analytical\
    \ department, that\u2019s probably the best place for the only data scientists\
    \ to start. Is that right?"
  sec: 1180
  time: '19:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I also think that data science is not the first step \u2013 it\u2019\
    s not the first thing that you should do. That's why I said that an analytics\
    \ department is necessary to have before that. Usually, people think that they\
    \ need some automated pipelines or models and stuff like that, but sometimes they\
    \ just need some dashboards and more simple analytics. So data science is more\
    \ advanced stuff that you get over time. That's why it matters to have this in\
    \ place beforehand."
  sec: 1221
  time: '20:21'
  who: Marianna
- header: First week
- line: "Yeah. Let's say you joined a company. You had an interview with them and\
    \ you really like them. They have data pipelines, they have an analytical department,\
    \ and they seem to know what they want. You think it's cool and you join this\
    \ company. So what usually happens after that? Let's say \u2013 on your first\
    \ day?"
  sec: 1267
  time: '21:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I would say the first thing that I usually do is try to discuss as much as\
    \ possible with different people. What do they expect from me? How do they see\
    \ my work? Basically, I try to identify the requirements and the main ideas. Usually,\
    \ the first week for me is exploring the data. Just saying, \u201COkay, let's\
    \ go look at the data,\u201D isn\u2019t really productive. It's always better\
    \ to have some problem in mind so that you can look at the data and think \u201C\
    I can use this for that.\u201D It was useful for me to know about the ideas, which\
    \ were requested to investigate. So I look at data and think about what I could\
    \ use, etc."

  who: Marianna
- header: First month
- line: "That's the first week, you said. Let\u2019s say, you\u2019re there for a\
    \ month already \u2013 what should you do in the first month? Do you already need\
    \ to have some sort of POC or are you still in the exploratory phase? I guess\
    \ it depends on the case, but what do you think should happen after a month?"
  sec: 1345
  time: '22:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think it kind of depends on the person themselves. I personally tend to\
    \ do a lot of stuff quickly. I try to get some results in the first month. It\
    \ doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a model, but some kind of research or insights\
    \ that can already be used. Basically, you're building a draft version of a model,\
    \ even if it\u2019s at the same time because you can try to do that iteratively.\
    \ You already can test out some hypotheses."
  sec: 1369
  time: '22:49'
  who: Marianna
- line: At the end of week one, you already have explored the data, you already know
    the data well, more or less. You try to assess if you can use the data that is
    available to solve the problem that you were hired to solve. If that's the case,
    you explore the data more and get some insights. Then at the end of month number
    one, you already have some sort of insights or even a first model. Right? Then
    what happens after a quarter?
  sec: 1409
  time: '23:29'
  who: Alexey
- header: First quarter
- line: "I think by that time, you should already have some kind of methodology that\
    \ you use. For example, I don't just build the first model, but I also build some\
    \ kind of pipelines around that, so it will be easier for me later. In case I\
    \ need to retrain it or deploy another model. That's why it will take me longer\
    \ at the beginning than later, because I already built some preparations for other\
    \ work that is going to be done in the future. Probably you should already have\
    \ some kind of analysis of what you've done. For example, you can at least start\
    \ running the model, do some kind of A/B testing to know if it's accurate enough\
    \ or how it\u2019s working. There\u2019s a lot based on the feedback on how your\
    \ model performs versus the processes and the product itself. At least in Restream,\
    \ we follow LEAN methodologies \u2013 it's really important to do a lot of stuff\
    \ in iterations on a smaller scale."
  sec: 1447
  time: '24:07'
  who: Marianna
- line: "In a quarter \u2013 after three months \u2013 you can already test multiple\
    \ hypotheses, multiple models, and maybe come up with one that really works and\
    \ then try to deploy it, right?"

- header: Managing expectations
- line: "Plus, you should have an A/B test and evaluate it. That's cool. What if things\
    \ don't work out well? I think that\u2019s maybe a happy path, where you identify\
    \ the problem, you see that all the data is there, you get insights, you deploy\
    \ your model, then you run an A/B test and you see a huge uplift. But that doesn't\
    \ always happen. Right? Do you know what the best way of managing the expectations\
    \ of a company is? Maybe they want to see fantastic results in three months?"
  sec: 1540
  time: '25:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I always say that data science is not a result-oriented field. I personally
    believe that any project in data science is basically an answer to some question.
    Even if you really don't like the answer, it's already some kind of information
    that we can use later. For example, when we know that a particular model doesn't
    work, it doesn't mean that everything is not working completely. We know that
    we should solve this problem differently, or we should use other data. We can

    \ the live product? And what factors are important to think about when doing that?\u201D"

- line: "I would say that it's better at first to test it out, if it's possible, outside\
    \ of the product. Sometimes, it's not always implemented inside of the product.\
    \ For example, the churn prediction model that I worked on in Restream, it basically\
    \ helps one specific team and it doesn't really influence anything related to\
    \ the product. It's not integrated inside. But sometimes it can be. For example,\
    \ when I worked in a FinTech startup, there is a lot of work-related to anti-fraud,\
    \ and credit scoring was one of the key components of clients\u2019 evaluation.\
    \ So, before integrating all that and running all the clients for this new way\
    \ of evaluating them, the thing that I did was a kind of A/B test. I just ran\
    \ it in silent mode and got some kind of responses from the model and tried to\
    \ evaluate that, instead of just turning it on and seeing how it works. That's\
    \ a risky thing to do, I would say. If you have these first results, you already\
    \ know if it's worth it to try to run it fully in production inside your product.\
    \ Still, even if it\u2019s running, I wouldn't say that it's not good to turn\
    \ it on for all the clients. It's better to do it in a kind of A/B testing manner."

    \ that's fun \u2013 for me at least it is."
