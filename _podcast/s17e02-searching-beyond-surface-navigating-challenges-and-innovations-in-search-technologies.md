  Technologies'
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about search. We have a very special guest today, Atita.
    Atita is an expert in information retrieval, also known as search. She has contributed
    to projects like Apache on OpenNLP, and she advocates for user-centric approaches.
    She's very passionate about promoting diversity in tech through groups like Women
    of Search, and currently she is researching RAGs. We'll talk about what it is.
    For those who don't know what this is – it’s an abbreviation, and not like rags.
    Welcome to the interview.
  sec: 115
  time: '1:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you.
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Atita
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks,
    Johanna, for your help. Let's start.
  sec: 152
  time: '2:32'
  who: Alexey
- header: Atita’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of search, let's start with your background.
    Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 158
  time: '2:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: For sure. Thanks for having me. I think I would definitely like to say at
    least one line before we begin – I've always followed DataTalks.Club since the
    very beginning. I think it's an honor to be here on the live interview – it’s
    definitely a first for me. Because we were talking about my name earlier, I think
    that's where I'm going to start. I am not sure if a lot of people have already
    noticed that my name is actually a palindrome name, as well as my last name –
    it's a palindrome. And as I can…
  sec: 165
  time: '2:45'
  who: Atita
- line: Oh! Both of them.
  sec: 199
  time: '3:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Both of them, yes. [chuckles]
  sec: 200
  time: '3:20'
  who: Atita
- line: Is it a coincidence?
  sec: 201
  time: '3:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it was a pure coincidence, because I definitely checked with my mom,
    and she told me that it wasn't really intended that way. It's also very surprising
    that the meaning of my name is… I mean, it's a Hindi-driven name, because I come
    from India, and it is derived from the word “atit”, which means “past”. So anything
    or the events that are driven by the past events – and I think our listeners would
    be very, very smart enough, if they can guess what exactly is driven by the past
    events, because that's probably what my mainstream job is, as well.
  sec: 202
  time: '3:22'
  who: Atita
- line: Machine learning models use past data to predict future events. So I think
    it's a mere coincidence that my name definitely falls into the similar stream
    as my career. And I'm pretty thankful to my parents as well for naming me this
    way. That was a short background of my name, and I hope we can now say it correctly.
    It's Atita Arora. I have no connection with the Northern Lights. [chuckles] Just
    to clarify. About my…
  sec: 202
  time: '3:22'
  who: Atita
- line: It’s A-rora, right? Aurora borealis.
  sec: 278
  time: '4:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's correct. A lot of people think that my first name is Aurora,
    because that's definitely the case in Europe. That's fine. But my first name is
    Atita. Arora is my last name. So about the career journey, as obviously you already
    have in the introduction. Yes, I started in 2008. It's been 15 years. And if we
    count the time before my Master's, it would actually be 2007. I would say that
    now, I'm feeling fortunate that I started with the information retrieval space
    pretty early on in my career.
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Atita
- line: But at that point in time, as an early-20s person, I definitely wasn't too
    happy with, like, “Why am I being pushed into this field?” Because I was campus
    hired by this company, which was really big into working on revolutionary products,
    and it was set up by a Stanford professor. I was feeling lucky that he chose me
    out of a batch of 96 folks. But when I joined the company, the first thing that
    they asked me to do was like, “We want to work on detecting the relationships
    between two entities.” I obviously realized over the course of the journey of
    my career, that this is called semantic web, which I started working on in 2007.
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Atita
- line: Definitely, a lot of people did not know about it. The application that I
    started working on was based on Solr and Lucene. Solr was pretty early on – like
    version 1.2 back then. And there was no Elasticsearch. People were still struggling
    to move from databases to Solr, and they were really pounding on [their head]
    about why they need to move away from databases and what is not present in databases
    and why they need to have a full text search engine. So I was born – or my career
    was born, between that struggle. While lots of my friends were working on Java
    JDK applications and .NET, I was battling with this beast called Semantic Web.
    It was definitely not a very pleasant time, to be honest. [chuckles] But now I
    feel good that it happened to me very early on.
  sec: 282
  time: '4:42'
  who: Atita
- line: It got traction later, right? [Atita agrees] I remember already in 2015, companies
    were using Elasticsearch, Solr… It was already [becoming mainstream].
  sec: 412
  time: '6:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, correct. Even Big Data didn't really have the name Big Data back then.
    I mean, when I was working on… I think only in 2012 is when I really understood
    that, “Oh! This is exactly what I do. Is this called Big Data? Okay. That's kind
    of interesting.” So yeah, I think in India, as well, we don't really get a lot
    of traction either – if I was in one of the Western countries (the US or Europe)
    back then, I probably would have been able to work on it more. So yes, I think
    this was the initial part of the journey. I think back in 2010-11, is when I was
    approached by this training company that works in a similar way as how Coursera
    works and they asked me to develop the course on Solr. So I think it was happening
    more and more, but it kind of sidelined.
  sec: 423
  time: '7:03'
  who: Atita
- line: I also got to work on a lot of content management systems, because search
    is a very backbone functionality of any content management system. Definitely,
    people can put on the content, but the major challenge is finding the right content.
    This was where I also realized that matching what the person needs –how to match
    the right content with the right person – and it just grew more and more as I
    progressed in my career. So I think this definitely kind of tricked my brain a
    lot more than that, and that's when NLP happened. I understood that natural language
    definitely has a lot of prospects, so about 2012-ish is when I was first using
    NLP in my project, and I was very surprised…
  sec: 423
  time: '7:03'
  who: Atita
- line: What do you mean by “NLP”? Because I remember, for me, NLP also started with
    search. There is this book, called Introduction to Information Retrieval, I think
    one of the authors is Manning (that's the last name). The book was pretty nice
    to read and I was recommending this book to anyone who was interested in NLP –
    as a good introduction to NLP. That's why I'm wondering – to me, NLP and information
    retrieval always came together.
  sec: 527
  time: '8:47'
  who: Alexey
- header: How NLP relates to search
- line: Right. I think, as of now, I would say that it is a definitely interchangeable
    term. But I think search, in principle – as I said, people were moving from databases
    to a full text search engine – people were still kind of hung up in that “token
    search” mode. So it was really hard. I mean, people didn't really realize that
    they could actually have more than one phrase and they could still have search
    results. I think this is what natural language processing kind of enabled, and
    we realized that with the content management system, it became even more and more
    important. People want to sometimes do things like describe the kind of document
    that they are looking for, sometimes with the content, sometimes with a title
    – so it definitely boiled down to, “How do we match the right content with the
    right query?” This is kind of where it went.
  sec: 558
  time: '9:18'
  who: Atita
- line: My curiosity into the other factors, for example, “What kind of query should
    match what kind of content, based on different kinds of business KPIs?” Definitely,
    there were a lot of other factors that came into the equation now. That drove
    me towards going for my second Master's in strategic business management. I wanted
    to understand more about, “How are these business components deduced?” I think
    this got really interesting because I never took up management as my first career,
    because I was very attached to technology. I wanted to make things by myself and
    I think that was very interesting for me.
  sec: 558
  time: '9:18'
  who: Atita
- line: Moving on, I think I wouldn’t be overbearing, if I say that I got a chance
    to work with all my dream companies. I worked with Lucidworks, which was a pioneer
    in search consulting, and then OpenSource Connections two years ago as well. This
    is when I realized that search quality is more than matching the right content
    with the right user and providing a measurable aspect behind it as well. So it
    was definitely…
  sec: 558
  time: '9:18'
  who: Atita
- header: Atita’s experience with Lucidworks and OpenSource Connections
- line: Sorry for interrupting you. I really want to ask you about Lucidworks and
    OpenSource Connections because everyone who works with search knows the names
    of these two companies. Especially if you go to conferences like Berlin Buzzwords,
    you usually see a stand from Lucidworks. They're quite present there.
  sec: 689
  time: '11:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. They have their own conference as well, Solr Lucene Revolution, which
    was later called Activate, when AI really became a thing. I attended those as
    well, as an employee.
  sec: 712
  time: '11:52'
  who: Atita
- line: I'm just wondering, how did you manage to get into these companies? Is it
    because you… Did you need to do anything special, or was it kind of obvious where
    they said, “Okay, we see that you've been doing search for so long. Come work
    with us.”?
  sec: 722
  time: '12:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, it wasn't that simple, actually. [laughs] I mean, if I talk about Lucidworks,
    one of the support engineers was in my class – the course that I mentioned, the
    one that I designed and delivered for almost two and a half years. He was in my
    class, and he reached out to me, “Join this company. I feel like you would be
    a great fit because of the way you describe things. It would be amazing for our
    clients to know how things are really happening in the background.” It was a pretty
    long process, to be honest. It was something like eight long meetings, and they
    grilled me on every different aspect of Solr and Lucene in terms of performance,
    and the application level and everything. Finally, I got in. It definitely was
    a very accomplishing feeling.
  sec: 740
  time: '12:20'
  who: Atita
- line: So just having the credentials of teaching a course is not enough, because
    they really want to test that you know the ins and outs. [Atita agrees] Because
    they’re consultants, so they need you to know that. From what you said, it's very
    helpful to teach courses, because your students eventually join companies. They
    always remember their teachers and they can recommend them.
  sec: 787
  time: '13:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would be candid to tell you that when I started teaching the first course,
    in 2013 or 14, if I remember correctly… I mean, I started in 2008, and when I
    was teaching in 2014, it was really hard because there were people in my class
    who were pioneers of Java applications, and they were asking me really low-level
    questions about, “Okay, so you're describing faceting? Like, how exactly would
    it work? I mean, can you tell me the low level of how faceting really works in
    a disk or in RAM? What exactly do you mean by doc values?” “It's a columnar index,”
    is something that I cannot get away with. They used to grill me and I used to
    really be like, “Oh my god! This is really taking all my energy.” I used to prepare
    for almost two-three days before that three-hour class on the weekend.
  sec: 813
  time: '13:33'
  who: Atita
- line: I definitely think that really pushed me going too far with what I really
    needed and I was digging into the resources and definitely using Lucidworks for
    a lot of my content preparation. At that point in time, there was no Stack Overflow
    or popularity of such searches (or reading material on it). So I always looked
    up to Lucidworks for different content and I was like, “How is it that I could
    work with such an organization?” That definitely had all my dreams and I expected
    that I would work with this company. It was definitely a very accomplishing moment.
    I think it was similar for the OpenSource Connections as well. Because when I
    moved on, I realized that maybe achieving good search isn't enough, unless you
    can explain what “good” is. I mean, you need to describe “good” in the parameters
    of the business KPIs, and I think that's what I got to know from OpenSource Connections.
  sec: 813
  time: '13:33'
  who: Atita
- line: I also think I got a brilliant opportunity to contribute to a lot of open
    source tools and projects. I've been contributing to most of the projects that
    they have. They’re very welcoming as well, and I think they have a very structured
    approach to address the relevancy and the search quality aspect of the search.
    I think they are the people who coined the term “relevancy” and “irrelevancy”
    of engineers. And they have a lot of courses and loads of content around it. So
    again, great blog post, and I think I’m a contributor on that too. [chuckles]
    I am taking that legacy of what I learned from them and I'm trying to apply some
    of that to my new companies as well. I've started working with Qdrant recently
    as a Dev Relations Manager. Hopefully I could benefit from all my learnings in
    my new role. Because we're on the topic of search, I think one thing that stood
    out to me at Qdrant is that, if I have an existing search engine, I could still
    experiment with vectors – I definitely always say this out beforehand – don't
    be smitten by stuff because it looks cool. It has to be very much implied by your
    use case. Everyone doesn't need to use vectors, definitely. You need to have some
    sort of investigation into if your use cases fit for vectors. If yes, then…
  sec: 813
  time: '13:33'
  who: Atita
- header: Atita’s experience with Qdrant and vector databases
- line: Qdrant is a vector database, right?
  sec: 1021
  time: '17:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that's a vector database or a vector search engine, if we can say that.
    I think in the world of everything being SaaS-based, I think it's a pretty decent
    proposition to go for. They're pretty amazing, because I also worked on Rust in
    2017. I basically have a lot of trust in Rust. [chuckles]
  sec: 1024
  time: '17:04'
  who: Atita
- line: So it's written in Rust, right?
  sec: 1048
  time: '17:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's correct. Yes.
  sec: 1051
  time: '17:31'
  who: Atita
- line: We had a demo from Kacper. I think he's still at Qdrant, right? [Atita agrees]
    He gave a demo maybe a year ago. I asked him, “Okay, it's like Elasticsearch but
    for vectors?” And he was like “Yeah. And written in Rust.”
  sec: 1051
  time: '17:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would agree, actually. That was also my first occurrence when I started
    using Qdrant. I mean, the API's and the console are very driven by Elasticsearch
    – I'll be honest. If people love Elasticsearch, they will definitely love Qdrant
    – only that it's more scalable. And because I have always been the advocate of
    open source – all my previous projects, be it Solr or Lucene, Elasticsearch, or
    OpenSearch even, because that was the last project that I was working on – I've
    been the advocate of open source. Sometimes, because we used to work with the
    clients, people used to be confused as to, “Should I be using vectors inside Solr?”
    I think if we talk about putting vectors in your existing system, it definitely
    comes along with a lot of pain in terms of having to make changes into your config,
    and then iterations for ingesting your index items, and then obviously, configuring
    a wrapper around how these results would be served.
  sec: 1070
  time: '17:50'
  who: Atita
- line: It definitely all starts with what exactly you want to achieve with vectors.
    So if that is what you want to do, I would recommend that you check out Qdrant,
    because you don't need to touch your existing search engine, because it can stand
    parallel to any existing search engine. It can also natively provide firsthand
    support for vectors only. The nature of being scalable and very, kind of, plug-and-play
    for vectors – it doesn't really ask you to bring your text search into the stack.
    You can keep using your text search, whichever stack you prefer, and for vectors,
    use Qdrant in parallel. That's definitely one of the perks – your existing application
    isn't really disturbed. You don't need to process everything else, and you can
    already kind of bifurcate from your messaging queue and put your vectors into
    Qdrant.
  sec: 1070
  time: '17:50'
  who: Atita
- line: So I'm just wondering – I know that there is support for vector search in
    Postgres, for example. Then there is support for vector search in Elasticsearch.
  sec: 1197
  time: '19:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Also Solr, also OpenSearch – all of them have support for vectors.
  sec: 1208
  time: '20:08'
  who: Atita
- line: Lucene supports that and then automatically does all that…
  sec: 1212
  time: '20:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. It fans out to all the products that use Lucene.
  sec: 1215
  time: '20:15'
  who: Atita
- line: In the end, you can also have a standalone vector database.
  sec: 1220
  time: '20:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 1226
  time: '20:26'
  who: Atita
- header: Utilizing vector search
- line: Let's say we already have an existing Solr installation, it's one of the latest
    versions, and it supports vector search. When do we need to go with Solr or Elasticsearch
    or when do we need to book for a standalone database?
  sec: 1227
  time: '20:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that's a good question. I've given several talks about using vectors
    inside Solr, Elasticsearch before. OpenSearch supports vectors natively as well.
    That talk was basically oriented behind people needing to dump their existing
    systems and move to one of these vector search engines or vector databases. That
    was not really the case. I mean, in your case, for example, if you can afford
    to have reindexing...
  sec: 1244
  time: '20:44'
  who: Atita
- line: Because I've worked on some projects where reindexing is not really an option
    – there are businesses who cannot really reindex their dataset. I think this is
    a very classic use case where you could use Qdrant, because you're not really
    disturbing anything that's up and running – there would be no downtime for existing
    customers, they can still keep on using your existing solution – whereas for the
    experimentation with vectors and trying to figure out if that is what’s going
    to work for your solution, you need vectors. I think this is where Qdrant comes
    into the picture. I think there's a new blog post released today – Andre probably
    posted that on LinkedIn. I think it's a very apt description about when Qdrant
    comes into the picture and when it is not relevant.
  sec: 1244
  time: '20:44'
  who: Atita
- line: Definitely, if you're looking for ease of operations and you cannot reindex,
    I think Qdrant is one of the solutions to go for. I loved that it’s not even pushing
    customers to things like, “We can do tech search for you. We can do this for you.
    We can train models for you. We can do N number of things for you.” We just do
    vectors. They’re very focused, and in my understanding, when you focus on one
    thing – because I have been focused on one thing for the last 15 years – I would
    say you turn out really good. You're not really distracted by so many different
    things – you’re not distracted by supporting multiple languages, text search or
    so on, so forth. So I would say that's definitely worth trying.
  sec: 1244
  time: '20:44'
  who: Atita
- header: Major changes to search Atita has noticed throughout her career
- line: As somebody who has worked for 15 years in this area, you probably started
    with creating indices for Lucene in something similar to MapReduce without Hadoop
    in there. Now it has changed significantly since then. So now we’re talking about
    LLMs, vector databases. I'm just wondering, for you, in these 15 years, what were
    the major things that happened that you saw?
  sec: 1380
  time: '23:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, a lot. A lot. I mean, it sometimes feels nostalgic. Sometimes, if I look
    back at the stuff that I did at my first company, it feels like I probably did
    that in my previous life because it's so different now. Initially, my challenge
    was – I was working with Solr 1.2 and Lucene 1.7, I think. They were both different
    packages. Making sure they work together was a heck of a thing, because it literally
    drained me with, “What kind of configuration would I put in that these two start
    talking to each other and doing the stuff that I really need to do?” From there
    on, they became one project in GitHub, and now they're separate again. From the
    feature point of view, if we take a look, after the introduction of more of natural
    language processing sorts of application features, the focus was definitely more
    on understanding the queries, and then synonyms and stemming and lemmatization
    and then promoted searches – all of these later came into the picture as well,
    as part of that era.
  sec: 1410
  time: '23:30'
  who: Atita
- line: Then personalization was definitely another thing. Initially, personalization
    was limited to configured searchers or a configured brand inside the configuration.
    They were still very stagnant – not changing unless someone changed them. From
    there on people wanted them to be changing every week, or based on the customer
    demand, based on what's popular (popularity index). Things were becoming more
    measured and then applied to driven searches. Then personalization transformed
    into, “What two items were sold together? We have to promote this brand. We have
    to have recommendations that consider, ‘If this person is interested in this product,
    what is it that we should recommend more of?’.” Obviously, machine learning came
    into the picture, then Learning to Rank became a thing, so the ranking and sorting
    was affected by that. Now we see that it's all about large language models. If
    I was to say something on that, we're definitely moving towards more and more
    rich features with every passing day.
  sec: 1410
  time: '23:30'
  who: Atita
- line: Now with ChatGPT, which turned one year old now, I think things have changed
    even further, because everyone wants a chatbot or a search bot in their business.
    People don't want to be limited to token-based searches anymore, people are not
    satisfied with synonyms or rules or search management, per se. People want more.
    People want their search engine to talk like ChatGPT and be action-based and so
    many other things. I hope I was able to answer that  and cover some of the things.
    I might have omitted…
  sec: 1410
  time: '23:30'
  who: Atita
- line: It’s pretty difficult to kind of squeeze 15 years into five minutes, right?
    [chuckles]
  sec: 1603
  time: '26:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that’s true.
  sec: 1609
  time: '26:49'
  who: Atita
- line: But also, I remember, when word2vec appeared, I was at university. Everyone
    was like, “Oh! Have you seen that? King – Man + Woman = Queen!”
  sec: 1610
  time: '26:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, yeah! That's a very classic example. Yes. It's one of the examples that
    I saw in almost all the presentations that I saw. Even now, I think I saw the
    very latest presentation, which was…
  sec: 1629
  time: '27:09'
  who: Atita

    have this Gensim implementation.” How do you keep these vectors? How do you use
    it? And then you implemented locality sensitive hashing (LSH).

    appeared out of thin air recently. It's been a thing since the 1970s.
  sec: 1658
  time: '27:38'
  who: Atita

    Back then, you would think, “Okay, I have vectors. What do I do with them now?”
  sec: 1669

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Right, exactly.
  sec: 1679
  time: '27:59'
  who: Atita
- line: But yeah, I think they were around for quite some time. Right?
  sec: 1683
  time: '28:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, they've been around since… I mean, they're older than me, [chuckles]
    if I was to say. The concept is older than me. And I think maybe the limitation
    in terms of the infra was one of the things that kind of held them back. And now
    that we don't have any limitations in terms of infrastructure – we have GPUs,
    and whatnot – that has basically enabled and made them fast enough that they can
    be used in production today. That's definitely something that has enabled it.
    But the concept has been around. If you look at the inverted index, that is also
    a kind of vector – it's just that it's in the manner of zeros and ones. As far
    as index, that’s also a kind of vector, it's just that the dimensions are going
    to be dictated by the number of tokens in your index, but it's obviously kind
    of a vector. If you look at it, that's one way to picture it. I'm very photographic
    in terms of my imagination – it’s easier for me to think, “Okay, it's not a new
    thing that I'm doing. It's just that we’re putting emphasis on the vectors being
    generated through another model that has the understanding of these tokens, and
    how the context of these tokens together would dictate into a pattern or a vector.”

    on my data scientist researchy hat on, like, “What more can I find out about it?”
    I mean, I would completely agree. Yeah.

- header: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- line: But now we have these things like RAG that, that I mentioned at the beginning,
    when I was reading your bio. Maybe you can tell us what this is? What is RAG?
    Why do you care about it?
  sec: 1838
  time: '30:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. RAG is the abbreviated form RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
    As the name suggests, there are two important pieces in here – retrieval and generation.
    What we tried to do, as part of my previous project with the OpenSource Connections
    – we were working with a client, applying retrieval-augmented generation in production
    for a very big research company. The basic idea is, as I said before – everyone
    wants a ChatGPT assistant on their website now, retrieval-augmented generation
    kind of enables it. What it does is, if you're using plain LLM in your search
    – imagine your question being sent to an LLM, which has very limited knowledge
    based on the data it was trained on – it would respond and sometimes you will
    see that the responses are not correct. It would make up things and these are
    generally termed as “hallucinations,” or I would say, a more black-and-white term
    that this response is not correct. There is no basis to justify that this response
    was correct.
  sec: 1851
  time: '30:51'
  who: Atita
- line: That's when the augmentation of your data with the existing LLM was born.
    What we do is in this case, we are sending the query to the LLM, we provide the
    context with the client data. This was the augmentation of the context of the
    data. This basically helps the large language model, or, for example, the OpenAI
    model, to have the context of, “This is the question being asked. This is the
    context you need to answer this question with.” Then there are less chances of
    the answer being a hallucinated answer. So that is what I was working on. Because
    I've had a background of machine learning as well, one of the things was… We have
    measured everything, I think. In my opinion, this is kind of something that business
    folks also need – if there's something that you have worked on and cannot be measured,
    (it doesn't fit together) – I mean, you need to define the good. The good in this
    case was really hard, the evaluations of such systems are really hard because
    of the nature of the problem.
  sec: 1851
  time: '30:51'
  who: Atita
- line: We need to have the evaluation to justify so many different things, like a
    go/no-go decision, because there's the reputation of the company at stake. There
    is the effort of the team at stake, and we don't want to spoil all of that. So
    we definitely need to have the evaluation to make sure that whatever we are shipping
    out is worth shipping out. Evaluation definitely covers that part. We also need
    to evaluate things based on the business KPIs, because now that we have access
    to KPIs (key performance indicators), we need to see that it matches with the
    business matrix as well. The evaluation of that system kind of becomes really
    hard because the main, underlying feature of LLMs is the diversity of the responses.
    It's not simple like search evaluation because we don't know what it will respond
    with.
  sec: 1851
  time: '30:51'
  who: Atita
- line: One thing that I probably forgot to mention is that these 15 years, I've given
    that to ecommerce search, because that's where a lot of implementations and projects
    were coming up. I've had very rich ecommerce experience. I somehow love ecommerce,
    because the results are fast, you see the response and you see the customer adaptability
    to the new features very quickly. The response is very driven by certain query
    needs. What I was trying to say earlier was, in the case of ecommerce, we have
    a very clear structure in terms of, “This is the query. This is the response (or
    this is the response document). And this is how relevant this is.” So we had access
    to the trials, for example. We knew that this query would give a certain number
    of answers, there was a concept around precision and recall, but RAG is much more
    complicated. LLMs themselves need to give you diverse responses like a human being.
    So if you ask a question from a human being, there's a good chance that it would
    respond back in different words or in different ways to the questions. This is
    what we wanted with LLMs as well. And if something is not responding with fixed…
  sec: 1851
  time: '30:51'
  who: Atita
- header: Building a chatbot out of transcripts with LLMs
- line: I just want to try to summarize what RAG is before we go into evaluation.
    This is an interesting topic. So, let's say… We have a podcast. There are 16 seasons,
    9 episodes in each. It’s quite a lot of information, right? For each podcast,
    we'll have a transcript. And let's say that we want to build a chat application
    based on top of these transcripts. In Slack, we have a lot of questions about
    careers and other things. I'm sure for like 90%-95% of questions, there is an
    answer somewhere from one of the guests. It would be cool to build… That's actually
    a nice idea. Maybe we should do that.
  sec: 2149
  time: '35:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is what I actually built. My God. I never open-sourced it. I open-sourced
    a very small RAG demo, but yeah… I am definitely cooking something up, which will
    be about RAG evaluations and also a RAG application that you hopefully could use.
    Yes, that also involves Whisper from OpenAI. That also involved podcasts. Not
    spilling beans about it, but yes – I was using transcripts and storing the vectors
    of this podcast transcript into the vector database. But the point being that
    again, another…
  sec: 2196
  time: '36:36'
  who: Atita
- line: I'm just curious – with the podcast… So we can do it and then we can build
    a chatbot on top of that, right? [Atita agrees] But the problem with OpenAI –
    it has no idea about this podcast. Hopefully it does, but, if you ask a specific
    thing about search, for example, it might reply, but not necessarily with the
    information I want. I want to use, for example, our conversation right now. But
    it might just come up with some answer and we don't know if this answer is good,
    right?
  sec: 2236
  time: '37:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's also timed. It is timed for the time when it was trained. There is a
    block – there is a cut-off for the information, so it doesn't know about any recent
    events. For example, earlier, we used to see with OpenAI that my response set
    is limited until, I think, June 2021 – something of that sort. So anything that
    has happened after it has to be explicitly provided. But if you provide that to
    OpenAI, or ChatGPT, for example, it gives marvelous responses.
  sec: 2270
  time: '37:50'
  who: Atita
- header: Ingesting the data and evaluating the results
- line: So we need to find a way to actually tell ChatGPT (or GPT-3, 4, whatever),
    “Look, we have these podcast transcripts and this is the question from the user.
    How can we use the transcripts to answer the question?” Then our goal becomes
    (the problem we solve is), from all these transcripts, and each transcript has
    like 50 minutes of stuff there – how do we actually find the right thing? How
    do we find the answer to this question in this database? The answer is, we have
    a vectorizer and this is retrieval-augmented generation.
  sec: 2304
  time: '38:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's what I also figured out. There are different… I kind of wanted
    to save it for my blog, though – but it's four levels of the evaluation that we
    need in the RAG evaluation. What happens obviously depends on the model that you're
    using – the model has to be driven by, for example, how general it should be,
    or how domain-specific it should be. The second being, obviously, how the data
    has been ingested. There are several different statistics around it – how have
    you prepared the vectors for the podcast, for example?
  sec: 2346
  time: '39:06'
  who: Atita
- line: How would we go about preparing it? You can ingest the entire article right,
    or you can just ingest every sentence, you can go with paragraphs – how do you
    select this?
  sec: 2389
  time: '39:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. It depends on, again, the user experience. What do you want to deliver?
    If you don't want the user to be redirected to, “Oh, this is the podcast where
    you will find the answer.” That's definitely not the approach that businesses
    want – they want the exact thing to be given to the user, “This is where your
    answer is.” A very specific answer. This is where chunking comes into the picture,
    which is why you need to invest a little bit effort into how you ingest these
    podcasts transcripts.
  sec: 2401
  time: '40:01'
  who: Atita
- line: This is where it comes into picture – the model that you've used, what the
    context length or the token length it supports is. Definitely, we also need to
    provide when we're going to chunk the entire podcast transcript – how much overlap
    should it have? For example, I may be referring to a lot of things that I might
    have introduced initially as bold, and then I will be referring to it/them/they.
    Obviously, the LLM would not really know what exactly “it” is, or what exactly
    “them” is? The overlap is of very, very big importance in that case. How much
    overlap does it need? We need to have an experimentation platform for that. Similarly,
    we need to have a chunking strategy, some of that obviously, Langchain has enabled
    – a small demo chatbot that you can build with Langchain. People have been discussing
    that all over LinkedIn if Langchain is production-ready, though.

    if you've not seen it, but Langchain is...

  who: Atita
- line: I’ve heard the name. But maybe some people haven’t.
  sec: 2500
  time: '41:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, okay. I mean, from my limited view, and what I've used Langchain for,
    is that it provides you with different connectors in which your information can
    be retrieved, or information can be absorbed into your vector database or your
    search engine, for example. It also kind of sits between your retrieval and your
    generation stages in the architecture.
  sec: 2504
  time: '41:44'
  who: Atita
- line: So retrieval is when we ask the bot something and then it needs to find the
    answer. This is the retrieval part, right?
  sec: 2535
  time: '42:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: The retrieval part is more like… For example, if you visualize it – say there
    is a query, and there is a search engine in-between.
  sec: 2544
  time: '42:24'
  who: Atita
- line: A query is what we put in the chatbot. Right?
  sec: 2554
  time: '42:34'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 2557
  time: '42:37'
  who: Atita
- line: For example, “I am a product analyst and I want to become a data scientist.
    What should I do?” That's the query. That's the question that the user puts in
    the chatbot.
  sec: 2557
  time: '42:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct, correct.
  sec: 2566
  time: '42:46'
  who: Atita
- line: And what happens next with this?
  sec: 2567
  time: '42:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: What happens next is, obviously, this query would either go directly against
    the language model, or, in our case, we would want this query to be sent to our
    vector search engine. What this will do is, your query is going to be converted
    into a vector, and your entire query is going to be converted into a vector search
    query. This is going to be sent to the vector search engine of your choice. This
    vector database would have the chunks, based on the chunk strategy, based on the
    length of the chunks that you've used, based on how much overlap you need, how
    many chunks you want to retrieve, based on the number of responses you want to
    have.
  sec: 2569
  time: '42:49'
  who: Atita
- line: As you can see, there are a lot of different things that you can experiment
    with. As of now, we assume that we know whatever we want in this case, and we
    retrieve, for example, five chunks – five relevant pieces of information that
    would help ChatGPT to answer these questions. So what we do is – then comes our
    prompt – the prompt that you basically send to OpenAI, that you are probably a
    research analyst or research assistant. This is your context, and this is your
    query. Now can you answer this question and then you can define some guardrails,
    for example, “If you don't know the answer, please don't blabber. Please don't
    hallucinate. Just say that, ‘I don't know, I need more context to answer this
    question.’” And then you basically process an answer – a relevant answer, which
    is prepared by summarization of these chunks and is given to the end user. Obviously,
    you can also spice it up by providing references to the related documents where
    this answer was prepared from, which addresses the explainability of the response.
  sec: 2569
  time: '42:49'
  who: Atita
- line: People want the AI responses to be explainable, so by attaching the resources,
    we could always say, “This is where the relevant information would be found.”
    Then there would be some sort of trust from the user that is built into the system
    in that case. But, as I was saying, evaluating such responses is very difficult
    because a user could have several different questions. It could be about a particular
    domain, it could not be about a particular domain. Obviously, we are not blessed
    that we would have access to the golden set or the judgment data. This is where
    the evaluation becomes really important. We need to break it down into multiple
    layers of evaluation. You could individually evaluate the model that you're using
    to generate the embeddings that go into the vector database. You could individually
    evaluate the chunking strategy and all the factors that are related to how the
    content is going to be split.
  sec: 2569
  time: '42:49'
  who: Atita
- line: And then you can also evaluate the retrieval strategy – if four chunks are
    enough, or five chunks are enough, or we need ten, because the responses from
    the assistant are mostly, “I don't know, I need more context.”  All that drives
    us into a more metric-driven system. Obviously, we can also have end-to-end evaluation,
    if the responses were correct or not, maybe using something like NPS (Net Promoter
    Score – thumbs up or thumbs down), which could be used to broadly identify if
    the system is addressing its purpose – if you address and answer the questions
    from the users. A thumbs up stands for, “I was happy with the answer,” thumbs
    down, “I was not happy with the answer.” There are ways in which we would want
    it to be adapted into a pipeline (a chatbot pipeline) or we could also do it in
    an offline way. I think my blog is probably going to cover both of these strategies.
  sec: 2569
  time: '42:49'
  who: Atita
- line: I’m looking forward to that. I just want to go back to the example again about
    a chatbot for the podcast. Let's say we built that. We somehow split the article
    into chunks, then we ingest each chunk, we create a vector for this chunk, we
    store it in a database (Qdrant, for example), then the user comes with a question,
    then we turn this question again into a vector, and then we use the vector (query)
    to query the database. [Atita agrees] Then comes the retrieval part, which is
    a vector query, then there is the vector database.
  sec: 2811
  time: '46:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: We're going to retrieve the content, yes. Based on the vector similarity,
    we are going to retrieve the content and this populates the context of the prompt.
  sec: 2851
  time: '47:31'
  who: Atita
- line: So we include this in the prompt. So, “I am a data analyst, I want to become
    a data scientist.” This is the question, and then, “Answer this question using
    these chunks of content.”
  sec: 2860
  time: '47:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, “based on this context,” yes.
  sec: 2873
  time: '47:53'
  who: Atita
- line: That's the “augmentation” part. Right? [Atita agrees] First there’s the “retrieval”  –
    we retrieve it from the database – then we augment our prompt. And “generation”
    is – we send the entire thing to the LLM and then generates an answer.
  sec: 2875
  time: '47:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. That's correct.
  sec: 2887
  time: '48:07'
  who: Atita
- header: Keeping humans in the loop
- line: And then we were talking about evaluation because, right now, I have this
    RAG system with all the podcasts transcripts, but now I want to see if it's working
    fine. I can, of course, go ahead and test it – make 3, 4, 5 queries and then see,
    “Okay, it kind of makes sense.” But there are so many moving parts, right? [Atita
    agrees] I can use different chunking strategies, I can use different LLMs, I can
    use different databases – the number of combinations of these parameters is just
    insane.
  sec: 2889
  time: '48:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: But I need to somehow come up with an OK thing that works, right? [Atita agrees]
    Here, we were talking about four levels of evaluation, at each level… but, for
    example, if I want to build the same thing, what's the easiest way to evaluate
    that this system is kind of working ? Do I use something like crowdsourcing?
  sec: 2889
  time: '48:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think crowdsourcing could be one. It also depends on how big your team is.
    That's a major criterion. I was actually going to recommend a book like Human
    in the Loop because, ultimately, everything needs to go through a human. I think
    the systems aren't really well-equipped enough, although there are strategies
    in which it involves prompting to evaluate the responses as well. For example,
    what I found when I was preparing maybe 30 questions and the sample responses
    based on the different domains that my chatbot is going to be used for. All of
    these 30 questions would have one response. So what I could use is, as part of
    a more black-and-white matrix, the one that we prefer in search systems like precision
    recall, ECG, MRR, so on and so forth – we would use vector similarity like, “How
    much of my response was similar?” Again, we're using semantic similarity here.
    We can, again, use vectors for that. Based on these 30 questions, and 30 questions
    evaluated against my RAG pipeline, also they have fixed responses already given
    into the table, “How much of my response was similar to the response that I had
    set as the ‘good response’ to this question?” Again, we're still playing in the
    world of vectors.
  sec: 2954

    “Is there any application of vector databases for machine learning? For instance,
    could it be used for making the training of deep learning models faster? Maybe
    there are some other applications of databases for machine learning?”
  sec: 3127
  time: '52:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's actually a good question, I would say, because there is a feature…
    I'm not sure how much of the space you follow, but recommendation is one thing
    that is a machine learning feature. Vector databases are pretty amazing at addressing
    this. Again, we can use vectors in many different forms – we can use personas
    as a vector. We could have the recommendation and have the personas, and maybe
    based on the persona similarity of two people, we could have a recommendation
    of the products. One of the other things that I saw is something that has been
    a recent change – recommendation itself has a very changed meaning as you were
    discussing the changes.
  sec: 3147
  time: '52:27'
  who: Atita
- line: Now, people are more driven towards recommendation in a certain session, instead
    of storing the recommendations for each user, because a user is going to have
    several queries – 100 queries. So these recommendations have to be updated per
    session, and this is where vector databases, and especially Qdrant, (this is supposed
    to be launched today, or maybe in this week, there’s going to be one of the changes
    where we can build the recommendations based on every click that the person provides).
    This is where a vector database is going to be amazing, because these recommendations
    will be updated on the fly based on every single click of the user.
  sec: 3147
  time: '52:27'
  who: Atita
- line: Yeah, that’s really cool. I know there’s this classical approach to recommender
    systems, which is called collaborative filtering. You take all the users, you
    take all the items, then you have this large matrix, and you somehow reduce the
    dimensionality of this. In the end, what you have is – vectors for users, vectors
    for items – and then what you can do is just take all the vectors for items, put
    them in a vector database, and when the user comes… or maybe you can pre-generate
    it, where for each user, you basically query the vector database and then you
    get recommenders. [Atita agrees] There are many different problems with this approach,
    right?

- header: Collaborative filtering
- line: What you mentioned is… With collaborative filtering, we would need to re-do
    the whole thing, right? Then the vectors we do from another training will be super
    different from the first training. What you mentioned right now with clicks updating
    for sessions – there are other techniques you can use?
  sec: 3294
  time: '54:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: And it doesn't need any fine tuning, it doesn't need… In the case of the cross-encoder
    method for the ranking, I think you can completely skip that part and you can
    do it on the fly. That actually reminds me of something really funky from 2016.
    The first time when the recommendation was introduced by Amazon, I remember that
    there was a talk given by someone from Amazon, who apparently bought a toilet
    seat, and he wrote to Amazon that, “I had one toilet in my apartment. I bought
    one toilet seat. I don't need any more toilet seats. Just get this toilet seat
    recommendation out of my feed. I don't need any more toilet seats.” So I think
    the recommendations have also come a long way from then. I think it's session-based…
    For example, like TikTok users or any video platform users, the recommendations
    are basically built on the fly. That’s what the next big thing is.
  sec: 3314
  time: '55:14'
  who: Atita
- line: This means, “Okay, I bought my toilet seat. Now I'm searching for something
    else. You can see that in my last sessions, I was checking out pencils.” Then
    you see, “Okay, I have checked out this pencil, that pencil. This person is probably
    interested in pencils. Let's just show him a ton of pencils instead of the toilet
    seat that he bought earlier.” Right?
  sec: 3368
  time: '56:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. That's very, I would say, the sensible approach.
  sec: 3392
  time: '56:32'
  who: Atita
- line: I’m searching for pencils right now. That's what I'm focused on right now.
    So it makes sense to show me what I’m interested in.
  sec: 3399
  time: '56:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Context actually becomes the thing.
  sec: 3404
  time: '56:44'
  who: Atita
- line: Yeah, that makes sense. Amazon is probably doing something smarter so they
    can know, now, the things recurrently ordered, things that you ordered and never
    want to order again, like a toilet seat. For example, I like peanut butter and
    I use Amazon for ordering that. They know that I might run out of peanut butter,
    so they’re like, “Hmm… How about you buy it again?” So they know when I run out
    of peanut butter, so they can push the recommendation to my face. And when I just
    bought peanut butter, I didn't see this recommendation – there is something else.
    They are very smart – they know when I will need it. They probably have a ton
    of different vector databases.
  sec: 3408
  time: '56:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: For sure. There are a lot of different permutation combinations, which is
    why I love ecommerce. It's so happening all the time – there's something coming
    into existence. There's always a new user need. That really pumps me up about
    the field.

- header: Atita’s resource recommendations
- line: If somebody wants to learn about classic information retrieval, before all
    these vectors, would you say that Introduction to Information Retrieval is a good
    starting point? Is there something else?
  sec: 3470
  time: '57:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say so. I would highly recommend you read the Relevant Search book
    as well. That's definitely one thing. We have tons of blogs and whatnot.
  sec: 3481
  time: '58:01'
  who: Atita
- line: Relevant Search. Relevant Search covers… Is it about Elasticsearch or Solr?
    I don't remember. It's Elasticsearch, right?
  sec: 3495
  time: '58:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's very search engine-agnostic in terms of the book, which is why
    I recommend it. There would be examples that come along with the book, hopefully
    also Solr-driven as well. Mostly Elasticsearch. But I think the idea is to communicate
    the thought process and knowledge of the concepts, which I think are delivered
    pretty well with the relevancy guy himself. You know who the relevancy guy is?
    [chuckles]

  sec: 3528
  time: '58:48'
  who: Atita
- line: He gave a talk at DataTalks.Club at some point. It was pretty nice to have
    him, actually. When it comes to more recent developments, like all this RAG stuff,
    is there a good resource? You mentioned that you're working on a blog post? [Atita
    agrees] But is there something else you would recommend checking out if somebody
    wants to learn more about this stuff?
  sec: 3531
  time: '58:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: From the evaluation point of view?
  sec: 3558
  time: '59:18'
  who: Atita
- line: Just in general and also about RAGs?
  sec: 3562
  time: '59:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, well… I think Langchain (the site itself) has plenty of different things
    that they offer – different ways in which RAG could be achieved with different
    search engines. I would definitely recommend reading about it. Plus, there's a
    new resource where I will be contributing my blog on Vector Hub. That's another
    place that I can recommend you checking out – great content. We're working on
    a lot more interesting content as well. Nothing else comes to my mind.
  sec: 3566
  time: '59:26'
  who: Atita
- line: Relevant Search, Langchain documentation, then Vector Hub. Please send us
    the links. [Atita agrees] Whenever you publish something new, we're also interested
    to know that. I assume every time you publish something, you also make a post
    about that on LinkedIn, right? So we can follow you there.
  sec: 3601
  time: '1:00:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I try to do that.
  sec: 3621
  time: '1:00:21'
  who: Atita
- line: Yes. So please make a post when you publish that evaluation article. With
    that, I think, that's all we have time for today. Atita, thanks a lot for joining
    us today.

    think about that. [chuckles]

  sec: 3650

  who: Atita
- line: I wonder how many guests we had in the past with a palindrome name. I don't
    think we had any. I'll check that. [chuckles] It’s good that we had the first
    guest with a palindrome first and last name. I think that's all for today. Thanks,
    everyone, for joining us today. Thanks, Atita, for sharing your experience with
    us.
