short: The Unwritten Rules for Success in Machine Learning
title: The Unwritten Rules for Success in Machine Learning
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about the unwritten rules for success in machine learning,
    and many other things. We have a special guest today, Jack. Jack transitioned
    from software engineering to data science, and he worked as both an individual
    contributor and in leadership roles. He managed, at some point, teams of up to
    15 people – currently, he is the VP of data science and machine learning. And
    soon, (there's even a date, November 15) he plans to move to become an entrepreneur.
    Welcome to our podcast!

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Thanks, Alexey. Thanks for having me. Great to be here.
  sec: 53
  time: 0:53
  who: Jack
- line: The questions for today's interview were, as always, prepared by Johanna Bayer
    – thanks, Johanna, for your help. Let's start.
  sec: 56
  time: 0:56
  who: Alexey
- header: Jack’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of these unwritten rules, let's start with
    your background. Can you tell us about your career journeys so far?
  sec: 64
  time: '1:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I started out my professional career in 2015 as a full stack software
    developer. I was working in a company called Trunk Club. They're sort of like
    Stitch Fix – they're owned by Nordstrom (online retail). I started out as a software
    developer, worked there for a couple of years in that role, but then became interested
    in data science and machine learning, and made a transition within the company
    to data science.
  sec: 72
  time: '1:12'
  who: Jack
- line: Do you remember what made you interested in data science?
  sec: 102
  time: '1:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah! Actually, I had sort of always been interested in data science – going
    back to my undergrad days, when I was a physics major and took a lot of stats
    classes. But this was 10 years ago, so at the time, data science was not well-established
    – there was no Master’s degree, there was no Bachelor's degree – there was no
    clear career path.
  sec: 106
  time: '1:46'
  who: Jack
- line: So I decided to do software engineering (a Master’s in software engineering)
    intending to go into data science, but ended up just really enjoying software
    engineering, so I stuck with it for a couple of years. And then, at some point,
    though, I started to become interested in machine learning again, and a data science
    team was spun off at my company. I watched what they were doing and became very
    interested in that, so I made the transition into that team through an apprenticeship.
  sec: 106
  time: '1:46'
  who: Jack
- line: So there was an internal opportunity.
  sec: 158
  time: '2:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah – it was not easy. I had to be very assertive and ask a lot of times,
    and then, eventually, landed an informal apprenticeship opportunity within that,
    where I was doing a side project. But I was able to switch, and did data science
    at Trunk Club for a year. Then I moved on to a company called GoHealth, which
    is sort of like Orbitz, or Kayak, but for health insurance. I was a Senior Machine
    Learning Engineer… [cross-talk]
  sec: 161
  time: '2:41'
  who: Jack
- line: Orbitz or Kayak? Orbitz, I think… wait, wait, wait – I was in the States at
    some point, and I needed to buy an airplane ticket, and this is what you use for
    comparing prices, right?
  sec: 190
  time: '3:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly.
  sec: 200
  time: '3:20'
  who: Jack
- line: Yeah. Okay. It's like Skyscanner.
  sec: 201
  time: '3:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. So think about that, but for health insurance – at least in the United
    States, most of us get health insurance through our employer and you have like
    three plans to choose from. But for people who are not employed, or people who
    are self-employed – to choose a health insurance plan, it's complicated. So this
    platform was basically the selection process for that. In any case, I was a senior
    machine learning engineer there – started out in that role. The data team was
    also new at GoHealth. Quickly, I found myself informally managing that team because
    there was a data science team within GoHealth and the data organization itself
    was maybe 15-20 people, all being managed by one person.
  sec: 204
  time: '3:24'
  who: Jack
- line: Naturally, people stepped up as informal managers and that was me for the
    data scientists and the data analysts around me. I was formally promoted to manager
    after a year or two and then, again, I was promoted to director after another
    year or two after that, most of that was around having successful projects launched.
    After a big project launch – that would generate a bunch of excitement and demonstrate
    value to the company – leadership would want to invest in more data science and
    machine learning. And, naturally, that would come to me. [cross-talk]
  sec: 204
  time: '3:24'
  who: Jack
- header: Transitioning from IC to management
- line: Just curious, in retrospect, do you think it was a bit too fast, too quick?
    You worked for a few years as an individual contributor and then – boom – you
    became a manager. Now, when you look back, was it too quick or was it just the
    right pace?
  sec: 287
  time: '4:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's a good question. I'll give you two short answers to that. The first one,
    I'll say is that because I did a lateral move between software engineering and
    data science and machine learning, there's so much overlap between those skill
    sets and professional maturity that I would say…
  sec: 311
  time: '5:11'
  who: Jack
- line: I assume it helped a lot, right?
  sec: 328
  time: '5:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: It did, yeah. It wasn't like I had just one year of experience before management
    – it was more like I had four, before being promoted because, again, there's just
    so much overlap between the two. I would say that. The other part, though, I would
    say is that being promoted to manager, it almost always feels too soon – and it
    will always feel too soon, because there just is a shift that is very difficult
    to emulate a seamless transition. It's a new paradigm, it's a new thing to experience,
    and it is always going to be a difficult transition. That being said – Sure, it
    was fairly fast, both good and bad results came from that.
  sec: 330
  time: '5:30'
  who: Jack
- line: But you also learned a lot, I assume Right?
  sec: 369
  time: '6:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, yeah.
  sec: 371
  time: '6:11'
  who: Jack
- line: When you move fast, you also learn fast – because you have no choice.
  sec: 372
  time: '6:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. When I think about the pivotal years of my professional career, there
    were two time periods. The first was just my first couple of years at Trunk Club,
    being part of a strong technology organization, developing a lot of really good
    fundamentals, and you sort of get into your groove. Then the next phase was going
    from a senior IC role to director within a couple of years. That was just very,
    very different from the other part. But I learned a lot. That's where you learn
    a lot of things that are not really taught anywhere. It's very difficult to teach
    them because everything has a bit of nuance…
  sec: 377
  time: '6:17'
  who: Jack
- header: Lesson not taught in traditional school
- line: There’s no school for VPs of data science, right? [Jack agrees] So you just
    have to… How do you actually learn these skills?
  sec: 413
  time: '6:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, for me, it was trial and error. It was realizing what works and what
    didn't work. [cross-talk]
  sec: 420
  time: '7:00'
  who: Jack
- line: How do you even know what worked?
  sec: 427
  time: '7:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. A lot of that is what I'll share, in general – just what works, what
    doesn't work, why it works. In fact, that's a lot of the reasons why I started
    to be more proactive on social media. But yeah, that was a great learning period
    for me. You learn a lot of lessons around being able to convince people of value,
    knowing when and how to articulate accuracy versus something that may be less
    precise, but more compelling – things like that.
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Jack
- line: A lot of being a leader is, in some sense, being a salesperson to the rest
    of the business, where you have to be able to demonstrate value, you have to sell
    value, you have to translate, “Why is this needed?” Trying to convince a nontechnical
    stakeholder why you have to spend a month on cleaning up tech debt. You need some
    sales skills to do that. So there's just a lot of things that are very difficult
    to teach in any kind of technical curriculum, because they're so opposite of what
    needs to be emphasized early on in that career.
  sec: 429
  time: '7:09'
  who: Jack
- line: Do you have an engineering background? Engineering education – software engineering?
  sec: 496
  time: '8:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. My Master's degree was in software engineering and then my first couple
    of years were software engineer.
  sec: 503
  time: '8:23'
  who: Jack
- line: So I assume it's not a skill you picked up during studies, right? [Jack agrees]
    During software engineering classes, you are not taught how to sell things. You
    learn how to do Java and algorithms and databases and all that stuff – you're
    not learning how to sell things. So it was all trial and error, right? You just
    see how you approach a person and you try to kind of sell a project or something,
    and then you feel what works and what doesn't. Right?
  sec: 509
  time: '8:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I would say it's a mix of trial and error and it's also a mix of observing
    what works for others. Another thing that is not really taught very often in any
    kind of school environment is the importance of technical problem framing and
    understanding the business and user side of the applications you’re building.
    One story I like to tell is, when I was a young software developer (a couple years
    into my career) I felt like I was really strong technically. Then I would look
    around and look at the people on my team and think, “Okay, who's better at what?
    How do I make myself better?” And then I would go to my tech lead and see, “Okay,
    what makes them special?” And something I observed was that my tech lead, at the
    time, was strong technically – definitely stronger than I was, because they were
    more experienced. But relative to the people around him,  he was not necessarily
    that much stronger, but there was a clear difference in how much he could produce
    and the value that he provided.
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: Jack
- line: The difference was that he was really, really good at taking the time to deeply
    understand the applications that we were building and taking one-two hour meetings
    with stakeholders to ask them questions and really just understand the aspects
    of the product as well as anyone else in the business. Because once he understood
    that, he could then come back to the tech team and be able to transmit, “Okay,
    here's what we need to do. Here's what we need to prioritize. Here's why this
    is the way that it is.” That is something that's very difficult to teach.
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: Jack
- line: It's difficult to teach, because when you're learning software development,
    you're so overwhelmed by everything else that hearing someone try to explain that
    is like, “Well, that's obvious. I can focus on that later.” It's very difficult
    to sort of mentally allocate the right capacity to something like that, when you're
    getting crushed by all of this very difficult technical stuff. So that's sort
    of something that, even when I post on LinkedIn – if I post something about that,
    the amount of interest that I'll get relative to posting something very technical,
    is so much lower. Because most people don't feel like they're struggling with
    that right now – they feel like they're struggling with the technical parts, so
    that is the more valuable piece to them. These other parts that really do help
    differentiate people in their careers often go unnoticed and are not learned until
    trial and error several years later.
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: Jack
- header: The importance of people’s perception, trust, and respect
- line: One of these things that go unnoticed, as you mentioned, is understanding
    the applications on a deep level, and understanding what generates value. That's
    one of the things, as you mentioned, this tech lead had that other less senior
    people did not. Are there other hidden things that are not obvious when you focus
    on technical things that are actually very important at work?
  sec: 693
  time: '11:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. One thing that's extremely important is people's perception of you –
    another thing that is never taught in any courses I've ever seen. In order to
    be successful, especially in leadership, but really, in any role – people have
    to respect your opinion. When you ask for things, they give them to you. That
    is just an essential part of being a high-impact either IC or manager. And in
    order to do that well, people have to respect your opinion. Developing a reputation
    for respect and strong consideration is something that is difficult and is something
    that I just learned over time how to do.
  sec: 730
  time: '12:10'
  who: Jack
- line: One simple tip that I give to people is – anytime you're given an opportunity
    to do a presentation in front of an audience, spend way, way more time on that
    than you think you should. Anytime you have an opportunity to speak to people
    that you don't normally speak to, they will base their perspective of you very
    heavily on that discussion or that presentation because that's really their only
    perspective into you – that's their only interaction with you. So, if you're giving
    a presentation to leadership, or even just other teams – if those teams aren't
    working with you directly frequently, they don't know how good you are – they
    don't know any of that. You really have to make sure that any time you're given
    an opportunity to interact with others who you don't interact with on a day-to-day
    basis, you have to take advantage of that.
  sec: 730
  time: '12:10'
  who: Jack
- line: That's where the sales stuff comes into play. Maybe saying things as they
    are is not always the best thing. You want to sell them, you want to promote them.
    Really, what you should be thinking about is, “What is the ultimate action that
    I want to be taken?” If you're thinking about the month of technical debt cleanup
    – if you try and explain the exact reason why that's so important, you probably
    won't get what you need. So you need to be able to communicate in another way
    and you need to be able to put on a persona that is well-respected so that you
    get what you want. That's another aspect that is just more of a “softer skill,”
    but it's critical to success. Some people can get to the top through just technical
    skills, but they're very few and far between. Most people who get to the top are
    doing so through nontechnical means.
  sec: 730
  time: '12:10'
  who: Jack
- line: So look for opportunities to speak in front of people who you don't interact
    with regularly and when you get this opportunity, invest a lot of time into the
    presentation that you give. Right? [Jack agrees] And you should probably avoid
    technical things. Like in your example of technical debt, you shouldn't say, “We
    need to refactor a lot of code because our classes are too long.” Right? You should
    probably come up with a good metaphor. Instead of explaining the code, you should
    probably find a relatable idea from the real world, and then explain based on
    that.
  sec: 885
  time: '14:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, and even extending that –something that I like to do is to think through
    what people care about. If you're working professionally and – let's say, you're
    interfacing with marketing. Marketing will obsess over things cost per acquisition
    – all they care about is conversion and CAC, and things like that. So if you're
    trying to present to them something related to machine learning, data science,
    or whatever it is – if you can talk to them in terms of impact to CAC or something
    that they will care about, you'll get a lot more attention.
  sec: 925
  time: '15:25'
  who: Jack
- line: Impact to what, I’m sorry?
  sec: 962
  time: '16:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: CAC – cost per acquisition.
  sec: 964
  time: '16:04'
  who: Jack
- line: Cost per acquisition.
  sec: 968
  time: '16:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's the amount of money that marketing needs to spend to acquire a customer,
    on average. It's like their primary KPI or key metric.
  sec: 970
  time: '16:10'
  who: Jack
- line: So, when you speak with marketing people, you need to learn their vocabulary.
    You need to use words like cost per acquisition and so on, so that they can already
    relate to what you're talking about. Right?
  sec: 980
  time: '16:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Once you start using that terminology or vocabulary, now they’ll feel
    like you understand them, and will start to have more respect for you. Because
    what often happens is, technology people speak technology, marketing people speak
    marketing, and both sides feel like the other doesn't understand what they think
    is important, and therefore does not understand anything important. So you kind
    of talk past each other a lot. But if you're able to speak their language, you're
    able to get their respect, and now they'll actually start to listen to you more
    seriously, because they feel like you know what matters to them.
  sec: 1004
  time: '16:44'
  who: Jack
- header: How soft skills are relevant to machine learning
- line: Okay. We'll see how relevant it is – I hope it is relevant to the actual discussion
    we plan to have today, which is about the rules for success in machine learning.
    Probably it is related. I just want to summarize. If you want to be a technical
    leader, there are some qualities that are good to have, like understanding the
    application, and then there’s the important thing of people's perception of you
    – you need to gain respect from them. For that, you need to appear in front of
    other people and speak their language. You use their terminology and then they
    treat you as one of their own. This way, you get respect. These things that we
    discussed – they're pretty interesting to discuss. How related are they to successful
    machine learning projects?
  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Very, very well-intertwined, especially with machine learning. In any kind
    of project, but specifically machine learning – one of the challenges with machine
    learning is just how complex it is, and how much support you need from every part
    of the business for machine learning to work. Any software developer will tell
    you like getting support for a new project is difficult and that's absolutely
    true. But the level of support that you need to execute a machine learning project
    that actually works and provides value is – I'm going to pull out a number here,
    but – maybe X3 of what a typical software project does. And that's because there's
    so much level of care that needs to be involved with generating data, transforming
    it, setting up that pipeline, building the model, building the prediction pipeline
    – there are just so many things that can go wrong, and so much effort that needs
    to be taken, that, in order to allocate the resources for that, you have to have
    a lot of motivation and a lot of buy-in from stakeholders.
  sec: 1096
  time: '18:16'
  who: Jack
- line: Being able to sell is a very crucial skill of pretty much any machine learning
    person, because in order to gain enough support for your projects, you have to
    be able to get people excited about the potential of what you're going to build.
    That's something that I learned maybe a year or two into my career in machine
    learning – a lot of the projects I wanted to build were dead in the water because
    I couldn't get enough support. So what I started to do was figure out the ways
    in order to generate excitement and get that support that I needed. One example
    is being able to get a proof of concept that I can use in a demo very quickly,
    to show on a real sample dataset (like a prediction in real time). That is very
    effective at getting interest between people because they can see the potential
    value of it.
  sec: 1096
  time: '18:16'
  who: Jack
- line: But going back to your question of how these skills intertwine with successful
    machine learning or the rules of machine learning. You have to understand that
    you don't just get handed machine learning projects and your only task is to execute
    on it. That does not happen. A huge part of your role in machine learning is to
    be able to communicate back value to buy yourself the bandwidth and the resources
    that you're going to need in the future. That's a very often overlooked aspect.
  sec: 1096
  time: '18:16'
  who: Jack
- header: How to put on a salesman hat in machine learning management
- line: So you mentioned that machine learning projects are quite complex, and they
    acquire 3X (arbitrary number) – they require a lot more effort than a traditional
    (usual) software engineering project. This is not to mention that these projects
    often fail because you don't know in advance whether the project will succeed
    after you put so much effort into it. How do you sell that? By doing this POC
    and showing that it kind of sort of works?
  sec: 1248
  time: '20:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: So there are a couple of things going for you with machine learning that you
    can leverage to your benefit. Right now, this is actually the best time ever for
    this because large language models have generated excitement across the entire
    planet. At this moment, it is much easier to sell people on machine learning than
    it was four or five years ago.
  sec: 1277
  time: '21:17'
  who: Jack
- line: Because there’s this hype everywhere – open any website and you see GPT, LLM,
    whatever.
  sec: 1295
  time: '21:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's a double-edged sword, where there are benefits and negatives to that.
    However, even so, it is still difficult to sell projects, because, like you said,
    there is so much risk involved. The connection that people make with machine learning
    is that they want to automate their decision-making, or what they think is possible
    with decision-making. So a lot of people… you can play off of that.
  sec: 1302
  time: '21:42'
  who: Jack
- line: For example, if you wanted to build a model that was prioritizing incoming
    inbound leads for your sales process – there are people at your company, who spend
    their days trying to think through, “How do we ensure that we're properly handling  the
    highest quality leads, which are people who are actually going to buy and spend
    a lot of money? How do we ensure that they're treated well?” Well, if you can
    build and showcase a simple model that says, “We can detect which leads are going
    to be high value.” It is very, very easy for people to realize the potential impact
    or use for that. And if you can give them even just a little bit of evidence that
    you're capable of building that, then they'll buy into that.
  sec: 1302
  time: '21:42'
  who: Jack
- line: So really, you want to play to what they care about, and then give them some
    evidence of that and showcase it – usually, visuals are really good selling points
    here. And if you can give them that, you're much more likely to get that buy-in.
    If you have stakeholder support, you can typically get the engineering resources
    – all that stuff.
  sec: 1302
  time: '21:42'
  who: Jack
- header: The importance of visuals and building a POC as fast as possible
- line: You said visuals are important to them – what do you mean by that? Is having
    a demo with a user interface where they can play around important, or did you
    mean something else? Or did you mean planting a picture in their head or something
    else?
  sec: 1398
  time: '23:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a good question. Let me make another comparison using the domain
    from a different company I worked for. I worked for Wayfair a couple of years
    ago, and… I’m using this context, just because it's easy to understand furniture.
  sec: 1416
  time: '23:36'
  who: Jack
- line: They sell furniture, right?
  sec: 1432
  time: '23:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. The model that I'm going to describe, I didn't build, but here's a hypothetical
    model and here's two ways that you could pitch it. One would be effective and
    one would not be. So let's say you wanted to build a model that could detect someone's
    preferences for styles of furniture. Let's say that I like rustic furniture (farmhouse
    or something like that) whereas maybe you like modern furniture or something.
    Let's say that I built a proof of concept model and wanted to pitch this.
  sec: 1434
  time: '23:54'
  who: Jack
- line: I could show people the accuracy of items bought that were related to the
    style of furniture that I said they liked. So somebody purchases a couch – with
    70% probability I can predict which type of style it is based on my model. That
    is not a good way to sell your model. A better way to sell your model is to go
    and show three examples of stylistic preferences that a customer has (that they’ve
    purchased in the past) and then show them the next three items that they might
    purchase in the future because they have similar styles. This is a good way to
    visualize.
  sec: 1434
  time: '23:54'
  who: Jack
- line: So you pick a random customer and say, “Okay, this is person X and this is
    what they like – this kind of furniture. These are their preferences. Based on
    that, we think that the next three orders will be these things.”
  sec: 1510
  time: '25:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Right. What that does is give your audience (your stakeholders) – it shows
    them loosely how the model is thinking about things. Maybe two different coaches
    are the same material or something – they can start to mentally wrap their head
    around, “Oh, here's how the model is able to think.” And then they can take that,
    and they can generalize that to all these other things that they care about, where
    it would be useful to have an automated decision-making process that could detect
    that.
  sec: 1526
  time: '25:26'
  who: Jack
- line: So really, you're trying to get them to understand the model and what it can
    do and then let them take that notion and [audio cut off] using their own internal
    knowledge. Communicating things in accuracy… At the end of the day, those are
    the things that matter, but they're not great for selling, because that's not
    how your stakeholders are thinking about things.
  sec: 1526
  time: '25:26'
  who: Jack
- line: If you start talking about accuracy – you say, “Okay, this model is 70% accurate,”
    which may or may not be a good number, depending on the model, but to the stakeholders,
    it might sound scary like, “Ooh, 30% error rate. 30% of the time, it will make
    mistakes. Oh, that’s bad.” How do you handle that? Do you talk about that? [chuckles]
  sec: 1575
  time: '26:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's a good question. Actually, of the two problems, that is the easier problem
    – trying to communicate error rates and things like that. Typically, what I like
    to actually do is not communicate accuracy, because it is the easiest one to pick
    apart and say, “This is not good enough.” What I try and do is discuss precision
    and recall, because when you discuss… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1605
  time: '26:45'
  who: Jack
- line: They're quite technical, right? You need to give very good illustrations to
    people. Because even as a data scientist, I remember studying machine learning
    at university and I was always lost at precision recall. For me, it was super
    confusing – I always confuse the two. It took me some time to actually feel comfortable
    with these two metrics.
  sec: 1627
  time: '27:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I don't actually use the words “precision” or “recall”. But what I am
    discussing is precision recall and what I would do is show, for example, a sliding
    bar of and say, “How much of a threshold do you want to draw between over-guessing
    or under-guessing?” Typically, I'll use precision recall, and then discuss… The
    goal is not necessarily to give them exact numbers, but it's to inform them that
    we can control the trade-off that we're making and they're more comfortable with
    that, because it means “Oh, well – if we're over-predicting, we can just take
    that slider back.” They remember the slider, they remember that there is a threshold,
    and it gives them more comfort to know that they're in control.

- header: 1st Rule of Machine Learning – don’t be afraid to start without machine
    learning
- line: I see, I see. Interesting. Well, we still wanted to talk about the rules of
    machine learning and the unwritten ones. There is this famous article from Google,
    which is called the Rules of Machine Learning. You probably know about that. I
    remember that rule number one is, “Don't be afraid to start without machine learning.”
    That's my favorite one. It's kind of funny, because if you're a data scientist
    or machine learning engineer –  how can you advocate for not using machine learning?
    It's a bit counterintuitive. Then they talk about metrics and so on. So this is
    definitely a really good article to talk about. But since, today, we’re talking
    about the unwritten rules, I'm wondering what these rules are.
  sec: 1726
  time: '28:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, awesome question. There's a lot of them. Actually, let me touch on what
    you just mentioned really quickly. Because I think, regardless of if it's written
    or not written, it’s… Maybe let me expand on that, because the importance of that,
    which is often not written. I completely agree with that statement – it is critical…
    And I would even go beyond saying, “Don't be afraid to start,” and I would say,
    “Always try to start without machine learning.” And the reason for that is because,
    the most frequent reason that I see machine learning projects fail is because
    whatever you end up building doesn't actually solve any problems.
  sec: 1773
  time: '29:33'
  who: Jack
- line: So even if you build an accurate machine learning model, that does not necessarily
    mean that whatever it's doing is going to provide value to the business. So before
    you build machine learning [models], ensuring that whatever problem you're solving
    is actually worth solving, with or without machine learning – that should always
    be the first focus. I always emphasize, “You should do a proof of concept, heuristic,
    rule-based model first. Forget machine learning, forget all the complexities with
    that. Try to just spin up a manual process or a rule based process that emulates
    what a machine learning model is going to do, but does so at a much more basic
    level.” Honestly, nine times out of ten, if you can't make that work, the machine
    learning model is also not going to work. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1773
  time: '29:33'
  who: Jack
- line: Yeah, I have a story about that. A few years ago, we wanted to launch a model
    for predicting the quality of pictures. If a picture has a good quality… It was
    for an online classifieds site, where people would sell and buy cars. One idea
    was, to make listings more attractive, we can look at listings with bad quality
    pictures. And if there are bad quality pictures, we contact the sellers and ask
    them to improve the picture, which is probably a reasonable assumption – if they
    improve [the picture quality], then more people will probably become interested
    in that.
  sec: 1863
  time: '31:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Then we started building the model – a deep learning one, of course, because
    it’s images [chuckles]. A few months later, we were finally ready to test it.
    It turned out that nobody really cared – the thing that people mostly care about
    when looking at listings is price, not the quality of images. Plus the sellers
    weren’t really super reactive to these suggestions.
  sec: 1863
  time: '31:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: So what could have happened instead, I could have just sat down, taken a sample
    of images, and said, “This image is good, this image is bad.” We then send an
    email to the user saying, “Your image is bad. Do something about this.” And see
    how many people react. One day of work. And then we’d see, “Okay, nobody cares
    about that. Let's just put this idea aside for some time and focus on something
    else.” I love this story. I mean, it's something I experienced myself. One thing
    is somebody when somebody says, you just nod like, “Yeah.” But having experienced
    this firsthand, it’s a different thing.
  sec: 1863
  time: '31:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. That is exactly like the type of situation that occurs. Again, it
    is also evident in software engineering, where a lot of people ask for things
    – 10 years ago or whatever, the common thing [to ask] was, “Can you build me an
    app that does this?” That was the question everyone wanted answered, “I have an
    idea for an app.” Or, after, it’s, “I need a feature that does this.” Eventually,
    you realize that you have to start vetting who was asking that question and why
    they're asking it. Because oftentimes, people think they want something and then
    the reality is that they don't even use it.
  sec: 1973
  time: '32:53'
  who: Jack
- line: That's basically the same problem as that, but much more intense, because
    machine learning is so much more difficult and expensive – both in terms of actual
    monetary costs and development time – that making a mistake here is much more
    costly than in just a typical software development project, usually. So it's definitely
    very critical. I just wanted to highlight that point, because when you think about
    the unwritten rules of machine learning, you really have to understand the human
    nature of getting lost in the tactical details of machine learning projects that
    all of us [audio cuts out]
  sec: 1973
  time: '32:53'
  who: Jack
- line: Yeah, and then you establish a baseline. Well, you first prove if this idea
    is valuable at all, then you can establish a baseline and then you can iterate
    on top of that and you can see if this is actually an improvement over the previous
    iteration.
  sec: 2049
  time: '34:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Another concrete example with machine learning was – at one point
    in my career, I built a customer churn model. In a subscription-based company,
    churn is when they cancel their subscription. For the company in question (I won't
    mention which one it is, just to keep things somewhat private) we tried to build
    a churn prediction model, and I did, and it was actually pretty accurate. It could
    detect who was going to churn. The problem with that was there was nothing we
    could do about it.
  sec: 2066
  time: '34:26'
  who: Jack
- line: We thought that there was going to be something that you could do when we
    were able to identify someone who was about to churn, but in this case, there
    was really no action to take that was likely going to make them not churn. So
    because of that the whole model was useless. It didn't provide any value. And
    the reason for that, is because it wasn't actionable. Had we gone through a more
    heuristic-based approach, we would have saved ourselves several months of development
    time.
  sec: 2066
  time: '34:26'
  who: Jack
- line: Was it the case because when you try to approach people and prevent them from
    churning, they're annoyed even more?
  sec: 2127
  time: '35:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would guess that that is often the case. In this case, it wasn't. It was
    more so because… The reason that they were churning was not because they were
    unhappy, but because of external factors that were driving them to churn. [chuckles]
    Again, I don't want to get too into it… [cross-talk]
  sec: 2139
  time: '35:39'
  who: Jack
- line: Then you would give away the company, right? [Jack agrees] But in a hypothetical
    situation, let's say there is a telecom provider and people are churning, because
    there’s a different provider with better prices, and you cannot lower your prices.
  sec: 2154
  time: '35:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Exactly. That's a very good reason
  sec: 2168
  time: '36:08'
  who: Jack
- line: If you lower [the prices] then you’re kind of working… You don’t generate
    enough revenue.
  sec: 2172

  who: Alexey
- line: Right. Your margin will be off, yeah.
  sec: 2179
  time: '36:19'
  who: Jack

    we have transcripts. So, after this is transcribed, this rule becomes written?
  sec: 2180
  time: '36:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah. Well, most of this stuff I''m already posting on LinkedIn
    anyway. So I guess at this point, it is written.'
  sec: 2197
  time: '36:37'
  who: Jack
- line: Ah, it’s too late. So it’s “commonly unwritten rules” that Jack has written
    about. Right? [both chuckle] So the first rule is – we'll get caught up in technical
    details and we… What's the expression? We don't see the forest behind the tree?
  sec: 2204
  time: '36:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, we lose sight of the end goal.
  sec: 2224
  time: '37:04'
  who: Jack
- line: Yeah, we lose sight of the end goal and then we just get too interested (too
    invested) in the details. Because it's exciting to tune all these knobs of a deep
    learning model, for example – or any machine learning model. Anyway, that's one
    thing – we need to focus on the end goal and sometimes this means doing things
    manually. Right?
  sec: 2226
  time: '37:06'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 2252

- header: The importance of understanding the reality that data represents
- line: What’s the next one?
  sec: 2253
  time: '37:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: The next one? Here's another unwritten rule. And that is… Well, let me describe
    the more common, written rule and then let me describe what I think the unwritten
    version should be – or what the version should be, that is unwritten. The commonly
    told rule is, “You should be obsessing over data and obsessing over understanding
    the patterns and the distribution and the nuances to it.” And I agree. However,
    I think that that is somewhat misleading. I think a better way of phrasing that
    is, “You need to understand not only the data, but you need to understand the
    process for the things that the data represents.” That is really what you should
    be obsessing over. For example, if you are looking at customer buying patterns
    for an online retail company, you need to understand who your audience is, you
    need to understand how they like to buy – it's even better if you yourself are
    a customer. You need to really understand, “What is it that is producing this
    data that I'm looking at?” From every angle.
  sec: 2254
  time: '37:34'
  who: Jack
- line: Because it's very easy to, again, lose sight of what's actually happening
    when you're just focusing on numbers and data. All of this makes way more sense,
    and all of the directions you go with your analysis are much easier to do, if
    you focus first on just completely understanding the real-world process that the
    data represents. A quote that I've started saying more recently is, “You need
    to recognize that data is a shadow of reality, not reality itself.” Because data
    is just an artifact being produced by something. Inherently, it is always going
    to be an imperfect representation of something else, and if you have access to
    understanding that real representation of whatever it is, you should focus on
    that. Because the data will never tell you everything – it will only be a shadow
    of what you're actually trying to understand.
  sec: 2254
  time: '37:34'
  who: Jack
- line: So if you can understand customer buying patterns, because you yourself are
    a customer, if it's understanding the output of a machine at a machine shop –
    you should be able to deeply understand what the machine does, all of its parts,
    why it's doing what it's doing. If you can do that, all the data will start to
    make sense. One example of where I see people trip up with this is that people
    will find nuances or patterns or significant things in data that are actually
    just not real – they're just anomalies with how the data is being produced. People
    will think, “Oh! I just found this new hidden reason for why a customer churns!”
    when, in reality, it's just sort of because the process for logging the data is
    biased in some way. Nine times out of ten, if you observe some anomaly in data,
    it's probably not a real-world anomaly – it’s probably just something to do with
    either the way the data was stored, or your perspective of the data.
  sec: 2254
  time: '37:34'
  who: Jack
- header: The importance of putting yourself in the shoes of customers
- line: So you need to have this domain knowledge. Let’s say you work at Wayfair (or
    some other store that sells furniture) you need to understand the domain – let's
    say the customer journey from the moment they sign up, to the moment they receive
    furniture (hopefully in time? You need to understand this entire journey and all
    the problems that can happen on the journey? From the first step to the last step?
    And the best way of getting this domain knowledge is being a customer yourself,
    right? If you work at a company that sells furniture, go ahead and use that website
    to order some furniture for yourself.
  sec: 2437
  time: '40:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, absolutely. In fact, I've always… Once I realized this, I started looking
    for jobs only where I was a customer because I realized how important it was to
    understand… To put myself in the shoes of the people I was building stuff for.
    So I really wanted to be able to identify with the customers. My first job… Well,
    my first job was at Trunk Club, but that was only a year in data science machine
    learning.
  sec: 2483
  time: '41:23'
  who: Jack
- line: When I was at GoHealth, most of our customers were Medicare recipients, which
    is people who are 65 and older in the US, so I couldn't really identify with them.
    I always found that part difficult. But when I was at Wayfair, it was very easy
    because I was already a Wayfair customer – I already purchased furniture. We had
    just bought a house, so I was buying furniture all the time. It was just very
    relevant. And then the same thing…

  who: Alexey

    but a lot of the rest of the house is. [Alexey chuckles] Yeah. And it’s the same
    thing with Fi, my current company. We make smart dog collars. I think my dog is
    probably somewhere in my office but…
  sec: 2537
  time: '42:17'
  who: Jack

  sec: 2555

  sec: 2558
  time: '42:38'
  who: Jack
- line: Like a leash, of sorts?
  sec: 2564
  time: '42:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's more of a Fitbit, or a GPS tracker. So if a dog escapes, you can
    track them. But we also do stuff like, you know, step counts and movement and
    behavior tracking and things like that.
  sec: 2567
  time: '42:47'
  who: Jack
- line: Like a fitness tracker but for dogs?
  sec: 2580
  time: '43:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. You have an app where you can see that your dog took this many steps
    today, or, “I took my dog for 10 miles of walks the past week. That's five miles
    less than what it was a week before.” So for people who are dog owners and interested
    in fitness or data tracking, it's a fun thing. Dogs and data tracking and health
    tracking are all things that I'm interested in. So to me, it was like, “Oh, this
    is a product that I am very interested in. It will be very natural for me to put
    myself in the shoes of a customer because I am one, essentially.”
  sec: 2582
  time: '43:02'

    relate?

  sec: 2625
  time: '43:45'
  who: Alexey

    a dog. [chuckles]
  sec: 2628
  time: '43:48'
  who: Jack

  sec: 2634
  time: '43:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it's great.
  sec: 2635
  time: '43:55'
  who: Jack
- line: Okay. So the second rule is, “Understand how the data is generated.” The quote
    you gave was, “Realize that the data is actually only the shadow of reality.”
    So you need to remember that and make sure you understand the process – then the
    data will make more sense and you will be able to understand that the patterns
    you find are not actually real patterns, but more like anomalies. And if you don't
    have this domain knowledge, you will not be able to understand that.
  sec: 2638

- line: Well, I guess we have time for one or two more rules. I guess you have a bunch
    of them, right? What's the third one?
  sec: 2675
  time: '44:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. Another unwritten rule that I've written about many times [chuckles]
    is that there is a lot of emphasis, when teaching machine learning, on mathematics
    and algorithms and things like that, which are absolutely essential. However,
    one thing that I think is often under-addressed is that, to be successful in machine
    learning (or to be high impact) you really need software development skills. At
    the end of the day, machine learning is software – it is a specific type of software
    – but when you build machine learning, you are building software, and it is likely
    going to go into a production state. So being familiar… not just familiar, but
    actually intermediate to advanced in software development skills, is critical
    to being successful in machine learning.
  sec: 2683
  time: '44:43'
  who: Jack
- line: This is more of, I would say, sometimes a hot topic that I have, where not
    everyone agrees with me. But what I can tell you is that in the six years that
    I've been in machine learning, almost everyone who's been successful in machine
    learning has been successful largely due to their skills in software development,
    or that they will spend the time to get good at them. Because it's very difficult
    to have success, when you are only able to address one part of the machine learning
    funnel and you have to hand off everything else.
  sec: 2683
  time: '44:43'
  who: Jack
- line: Because it requires that you'll be in a position where there are others who
    are extremely competent, and can work with you to hand off a model in a Jupyter
    Notebook and hand it off and then deploy it – there are a lot of steps involved
    there. To be reliant on others to do that, well, is very limiting in terms of
    your own success. It also means that it's difficult to put you on projects where
    there are limited resources. I can't give somebody a full stack ML project if
    I know that I don't have enough MLOps resources, which is especially true in smaller
    companies.
  sec: 2683
  time: '44:43'
  who: Jack
- line: So you need to be some sort of full stack data science machine learning person,
    ideally. Right. If you can do that, then you can take a project end-to-end. You
    don't need to be an expert in all the areas, but just know enough to take the
    notebook and put it as a web service.
  sec: 2808
  time: '46:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I want to make a careful distinction that… Because a lot of times what
    people think that I'm saying is that you don't need to know machine learning that
    well, which isn't true. You do need to know machine learning. You also need to
    know software engineering or software development. So I would say it's more so
    that there is a strong balance. Typically, the emphasis is on learning the machine
    learning side.
  sec: 2829
  time: '47:09'
  who: Jack
- line: Again, because it's so difficult and it's very overwhelming that even understanding
    that part takes up all of your mental bandwidth, that thinking about software
    development too, just seems unnecessary. When, in reality, it is very important
    to understand, “Can you take a piece of code and put it into a web server on AWS?”
    If you can do that, and you can do it comfortably, you're in a really good spot
    to be able to deploy machine learning models and be a full stack ML developer.

- line: What we teach in our courses – what we say in our courses, “Your model can
    be super good, but if nobody can use it (if it's just in a Jupyter notebook) then
    it's not good. It's of no use.” You need to be able to do that. All these unwritten
    rules are already written, as you said, somewhere. You probably publish them on
    LinkedIn. So can you tell us more about where people can find this content – all
    these things we talked about.

- line: Yeah. As of right now, it's all on LinkedIn. I write one post every day. I
    post it every day at 6:15 AM, central time. For the ones that I think are really
    good and informative… [cross-talk]

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Well, I write it the day before, and then I schedule it to be posted
    at 6:15. But then I’m actually up at six to respond to people's comments. But
    I leave them in my featured section on LinkedIn. At some point, maybe I'll consider
    doing a newsletter. I know that's commonly what people do. At the moment, though…
    I only started writing on LinkedIn a few months ago. I started in late July, which
    was the first time I ever posted on LinkedIn. Even just now, I'm sort of figuring
    out what I want to say and how I want to say it. So, at the moment, that's where
    it is. But if you follow me there, you'll stay in touch with some other places
    that I'll be putting this data.

  who: Jack
- line: A good idea is – in LinkedIn, you can click on the bell icon, and the moment
    you do this, you'll get notified about the posts. Because the problem with LinkedIn
    is, you need to rely on the algorithm to make sure that next time I open it, I
    see your post. Meanwhile, in a newsletter, you don't have this problem. [Jack
    agrees] You actually deliver and then it's up to me to decide, “Do I have time
    to read it now or I'll have time to read it later?”

    a very good point. Yeah,
  sec: 3008
  time: '50:08'
  who: Jack
- line: I think you should start a newsletter. Because for me, if I really want to
    make sure I do not miss your content, I'd rather subscribe to a newsletter rather
    than rely on the algorithm to constantly show it to me. Because they, one day,
    might decide that “Okay, let's show more ads on them.”

    consider that now.

  sec: 3037
  time: '50:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: On November 15, that will be my last day at my company, Fi. I am leaving to
    start a new business in machine learning, data science, and more generally, data
    recruiting. There's an idea that I've been thinking through the last couple of
    years – I've known I want to do this, and I think now's a good time – which is,
    I think we are in a spot where we need a big shift in how technology hiring is
    done. I'm very unhappy for many reasons with the current state of hiring, both
    from an employer perspective and a candidate perspective.
  sec: 3040
  time: '50:40'
  who: Jack
- line: I think there's so much noise in the system that it is very subjective who
    is considered for a role. People don't feel like they have any control over where
    they get considered for a role. I don't think people are interviewing for all
    the things that actually matter in success. Think through all the things I discussed
    today in terms of what drives success – how many of those things are actually
    interviewed for well in technology? Very few. I have done hiring differently throughout
    my career. I've approached it in ways that I think makes sense.

  time: '50:40'
  who: Jack
- line: You know, you can take a look at the teams that I've built over the last five,
    six years, and they speak for themselves in terms of how strong they are. So what
    I want to do is take this and give it to other employers and other companies as,
    “Hey, here's a different way of thinking about hiring, where you can actually
    have a much clearer picture around what success looks like.” And for candidates
    – to be able to give them more control of, “Let's think through what your strengths
    are. How do we best showcase them?” Rather than putting you through arbitrary
    quizzes and questions that may not actually align well with your strengths.
  sec: 3040

  who: Jack
- line: So I'm going to start a business that is in technology, hiring, and recruiting
    and it's going to focus, in the short-term, on machine learning and data science
    and maybe some other data roles. But in general, I would like to extend it to
    any technology role. The idea is to be able to give people more ability to articulate,
    on the candidate's side, what their strengths are, and showcase that – make that
    available as opposed to just a traditional resume. And on the employer side, to
    be able to both understand what it is that they need to succeed, and be able to
    find that quickly instead of having to do many hours of interviewing on their
    own.

  who: Jack
- line: We will all subscribe – follow you on LinkedIn – and we will see all the updates
    about your new endeavor. I don't like saying good luck because you probably don't
    need luck – you need something like perseverance, more – but luck is also important.
    So have fun with your new project. And thanks a lot for coming, joining us today,
    sharing your experience – all these unwritten rules. And thanks, everyone, too.
    I unfortunately have to run. But it was a great pleasure talking with you. Have
    a great rest of your week!
