short: Using Data for Asteroid Mining
title: Using Data for Asteroid Mining
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about extracting space resources from asteroids. We
    have a special guest today, Daynan. Daynan and his co-founders created Karman+
    to mine near-Earth asteroids. Previously, he worked as a data scientist, so I
    thought it would be a great idea to invite him to talk about applications of data
    science for mining asteroids, specifically and for astronomy in general. Welcome.

  who: Daynan
- header: Daynan’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of astronomy, data, and mining asteroids,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so
    far?
  sec: 111
  time: '1:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. When I was younger, I was very interested in astronomy and science.
    As an undergrad, I took a heavy course load in physics and astronomy – and cosmology
    actually was one of my favorite classes. I also took some courses in neuropsychology
    and cognitive perception. I was interested in research and thought very heavily
    about going into a career in academics. But for a number of reasons, I just didn't
    feel that that was a path for me. I was also interested in public service. So
    when I graduated, I ended up doing work with a nonprofit here in New York City,
    where I live.
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Daynan
- line: That kind of spun my career into a combination of public service, finance,
    politics – I ran a congressional campaign, that's a whole other podcast I'll spare
    you. But I ended up working for the New York City Mayor's office under Michael
    Bloomberg about 10 years ago, after Hurricane Sandy hit the city. It was a very
    impactful job and I love the people I worked with. It was a trajectory where I
    could see a lot of possibilities in the future and interesting work, but my heart
    wasn't in it. I realized, when I thought back to the fork in the road – for me,
    that was leaving science. I wanted to get back to that. I wanted to work and problem-solve
    with data.
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Daynan
- line: And I went back to school at NYU to pivot my career and I got a degree in
    informatics. A couple of very close advisers of mine were actually astrophysicists
    that were practicing academics. Much of what I learned as a data science scientist,
    I learned from them and really appreciated it. After I graduated, I ended up working.
    I thought about getting a PhD, but at that point, it was just not feasible economically
    or otherwise. And I also wanted to jump in and get my hands dirty. So I ended
    up working in industry. I worked for a great company called GeoPhy, I worked with
    The World Bank, I worked with the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency,
    with a company called New Light Technologies – mostly working with remote sensing.
    And so over the last several years, I've been able to do a lot of work with data
    analysis and machine learning related to remote sensing and making sense of that
    data.
  sec: 193
  time: '3:13'
  who: Daynan
- line: About a year ago, I got a call from a former colleague of mine who said, “Hey,
    I'm starting an asteroid mining company. Resources are important. We want to go
    find them on asteroids. Do you want to help me build the science and engineering
    team?” And I said, “Sure. I’m in.”[chuckles] It was maybe a little bit of a longer
    conversation than that. But it basically kind of came down to that. So a few months
    ago, I quit my job full time and have been doing this, and building the team out,
    and helping design our strategy. Some things are the same – on my best days, I
    still work with data. It's a big messy soup and I'm looking for patterns. Some
    things are different. As a co-founder, I now have to think about the business
    a lot more. And we're looking for asteroids – that's a new thing for me. So yeah,
    that's what brings us here.
  sec: 193
  time: '3:13'
  who: Daynan
- header: Astronomy vs cosmology
- line: You mentioned a couple of interesting things. I want to go way back when you
    said you studied astronomy and also cosmology. Are there any differences between
    the two? Aren’t they the same thing?
  sec: 292
  time: '4:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, good question. Well, I guess one big difference is that the timescales
    in astronomy are pretty massive – you can even think about it in millions of years.
    Whereas with cosmology, we are talking billions of years. My sister is an academic
    – she's a philosopher and in physics, and she looks at things like quantum field
    theory in cosmology. There, you're really pushing the edge of theory because you're
    thinking about things that… we don't even know how well our physical laws hold
    up in certain states or what we can know about them. It gets interesting. You
    certainly aren't able to do experiments in the same way. Whereas astronomy is
    at least a little bit more focused (in my mind, I guess) on what you can observe
    immediately. So they're very closely related. Cosmology is, I don't know – it’s
    fascinating to think about our universe in that broad perspective. Very related,
    of course, and one drives the other, for sure.
  sec: 304
  time: '5:04'
  who: Daynan
- header: Applications of data science and machine learning in astronomy
- line: The next question I wanted to ask you was about applications of data science
    and machine learning for astronomy. But before that – are there applications for
    cosmology in data science and machine learning?
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I think whenever you're looking at massive amounts of data – and we're
    getting more data – the answer is always ‘yes’. If you have a lot of data that
    you need to understand, I think data science is directly applicable there and
    cosmology is probably in need of it. I love talking about LIGO  (Light Interferometer
    Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and the detection of gravitational waves, which
    are traveling across billions of light years. That is pretty fascinating. There's
    so much we can learn about the creation of our universe, I believe, and how it
    exists, and how it's moving. Obviously, parsing that data, as with the Large Hadron
    Collider, you're dealing with a pretty massive amount of data information. How
    much of that is noise? How much of that is signal? What is the signal telling
    us? I think from a cosmological perspective, there is certainly a need for data
    science and machine learning. I'm sure someone could speak more intelligently
    about that than I. But yeah, it's there.
  sec: 378
  time: '6:18'
  who: Daynan
- header: Determining signal vs noise
- line: Yeah, so gravitational waves. I'm wondering how much we (people from Earth)
    can observe with these gravitational waves. How much signal is there? How much
    noise is there?
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well there's enough to actually make some pretty interesting discoveries.
    So the fact that we're now, with some regularity, detecting not only black holes
    crashing into each other, (which is a thing that happens, by the way, if you didn't
    know that) but neutron stars. So it's pretty fascinating. There was even an anecdote.
    I know a few years ago, in 2017, they had detected what they thought were neutron
    stars colliding. There are two detectors in the US – in Washington State and in
    Louisiana – one of them detected this unmistakable signal, or so they thought.
    The other detector did not. So by their own rules, they thought, “Well, this is
    an anomaly or it's not a true detection.” But it was confusing, because it was
    so clear. There's a third detector in Italy that also didn't detect it. Well,
    it turned out, the one in Louisiana had what they call a ‘glitch’, which is a
    noise.
  sec: 453
  time: '7:33'
  who: Daynan
- line: They’re very sensitive instruments and so maybe a jackhammer was going off
    or something. And they scrub the noise at just the right time that the signal
    happened – which is a low frequency probability, but it can happen. Sure enough,
    when a postdoc went back and looked at the data, they saw that that glitch was
    there. When they were able to mask around it, they were able to see the signal.
    So indeed, it had been there. And I use this as an anecdote for why you need science
    in addition to machine learning – the automated pipeline obviously didn't detect
    it and didn't understand that that was a signal.
  sec: 453
  time: '7:33'
  who: Daynan
- line: What's also fascinating about the story is that third detected Italy also
    didn't detect it. And the reason there is likely because, as gravity is oscillating
    through space in three dimensions (four if you include time) – the detectors are
    actually two lasers that are optimized for two dimensions. So if they're oriented
    in just the right spot, there's a blind spot. So it just so happened that this
    Italian detector was in the blind spot of where the gravity waves were coming
    from. So you have this combination of coincidences and physics and all kinds of
    things around the story that I find quite fascinating. Not to go on a tangent,
    but to answer your question – yes, as humans, we can detect gravity. That's pretty
    cool.
  sec: 453
  time: '7:33'
  who: Daynan
- line: Going back to astronomy, there are applications of machine learning and data
    science there as well. Can you tell us how it's used?
  sec: 579
  time: '9:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. So, data science, I look at it like data analysis, information theory
    – there's a lot of things related to that. And so generative processes are an
    important part of how I think about data science. If you're an astronomer, your
    proximate generative processes usually involve some detector – a sensor, a camera
    or maybe a radio antenna. You're measuring energy that's been collected and how
    that energy is measured and put it into numerical arrays is critically important
    for you to understand. So understanding those generative processes – even beyond
    that, what are you observing? What natural phenomenon? Obviously, deep space astronomers
    are looking at quasars, galaxies, black holes, pulsars – all kinds of things –
    exoplanets.
  sec: 589
  time: '9:49'
  who: Daynan
- line: In Solar System astronomy, we're looking at objects moving around the Sun,
    so we're seeing light reflected from the sun off an object and that can tell us
    a great deal about that object. Certainly for asteroids, that's a big part of
    what we're interested in. How you pull these things together across different
    platforms takes on more of the data engineering need, because there are a lot
    of complex science and data pipelines built around these observatories that you
    have to really understand and structure.
  sec: 589
  time: '9:49'
  who: Daynan
- line: Signal processing is a major component, certainly, of the data science side.
    Exploratory data analysis, I think, is pretty underrated. I love doing exploratory
    data analysis – you can see patterns and things and in the data you're looking
    at. Then, in machine learning, there are so many different tasks that are applicable,
    but I think a lot of it can come down to – machine learning labels things. There
    are a lot of things to label in astronomy. If you're looking at computer vision,
    you want to find sources, “Is this pixel part of a source? Is the adjacent pixel
    part of the same source? How do you know?” Exercises related to that. Signal processing,
    again, when you're trying to figure out how to denoise an image and make some
    choices about what noise is – because everything's information, some information
    you can ignore.
  sec: 655
  time: '10:55'
  who: Daynan
- line: Machine learning is great for scaling those tasks out. Time series analysis
    is a major one. Clustering of all kinds of things – spectral data, you name it.
    Dimension reduction is something I've used quite a bit. Probably a lot of people,
    data scientists at least, are familiar with principal component analysis. It's
    a bit finicky – you have to have data that's fairly well normalized, that's well-conditioned.
    I like looking at auto-encoders, which have been very popular in terms of techniques
    for dealing with dimension reduction, among other things. So I think there's a
    lot of opportunity there.
  sec: 655
  time: '10:55'
  who: Daynan
- line: Super resolution using generative adversarial networks, I haven't worked with
    myself directly, but I see a lot of promise there to artificially sharpen low-res
    images and see some structure. Any tasks where you need to scale things out. You're
    talking about petabytes worth of data, so you need to scale a lot of tasks out.
    It could be a task where an astronomer might be able to identify some artifact
    or something that's of interest, can that be scaled out? And I think that's a
    call for machine learning and deep learning. So there's a lot of promise there.
  sec: 655
  time: '10:55'
  who: Daynan
- header: What the data looks like in astronomy
- line: I'm just wondering what the data looks like. Is it not the usual JPEG images
    with three channels? RGB? It's something different, right?
  sec: 765
  time: '12:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Great question. Yeah, if you think about even just an image, right? What is
    an image? Well, it's usually organized in pixels. Or if you want to think of it
    as a matrix – you have cells of data. As you mentioned, most images used to have
    three channels – red, green, and blue. If you just look at an image, the combination
    of those, at a pixel level, will give you a lot of information visually. If you
    were doing image analysis, you also know that looking at the histogram of those
    channels, that is incredibly helpful information – seeing what the distribution
    of red, green and blue is. Well, if you're thinking about hyperspectral imagery,
    which is fairly common in Earth observation that I've been working on, as well
    as in astronomy, you're looking across a number of channels.
  sec: 777
  time: '12:57'
  who: Daynan
- line: It's hard for us as humans to visualize something like that. That's where
    data visualization takes on an importance. Again, you might look at things like
    histograms, or other ways to show that data – that are not just image data. That
    takes on a lot of importance and then that might be something that you're trying
    to optimize with some machine learning algorithm to look for patterns in that
    sense. At the end of the day, they're really just numerical matrices – if you
    want to think of it that way. But the amount of information packed into these
    images is pretty intense. And don't forget, time is a factor here as well. So
    special-temporal images are a pretty big factor in astronomy.
  sec: 777
  time: '12:57'
  who: Daynan
- line: And with these hyperspectral Imager images, (I hope I pronounced that correctly)
    I guess there are more than three channels, right? So what are these channels
    usually? Are they infrared channels, or?
  sec: 864
  time: '14:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah! They certainly can be. When I was in grad school, we worked with a camera
    that had 172 channels across mostly the visible spectrum and a little bit into
    the infrared. So you're getting into 800-900 nanometers. The visible spectrum
    – the colors that we see – I think are something like 350 or 400 nanometers to
    about 800, or something in that range. Infrared then goes beyond that. If you
    have spatial resolution, you can think of a high-res image as having pixels that
    represent a much, much more precise amount of information spatially. Well, you
    can also have that with spectral images. So, a red, green, and blue resolute image
    is obviously not very resolute – you just have three general channels. If you
    have a hyperspectral camera, you can divide that electromagnetic spectrum, (which
    is continuous, of course) into much, much smaller segments. In which case, you
    have a lot more information that you're looking at, just as you would with a high-res
    image. That certainly can extend into the near-mid or even long infrared. That's
    actually fascinating for us in astronomy, because we're looking (I’ll get into
    this more later), but we're looking for water, actually.
  sec: 880
  time: '14:40'
  who: Daynan
- line: It turns out, if you understand the physics of it, that hydroxyl bonds (hydrogen,
    oxygen) absorb water at about three microns, which is way beyond what we can see
    visually. If you look at the spectra of an object that's got water in it, you'll
    see an absorption line or some feature at about three microns. That's certainly
    useful for us, if we're looking at spectral signatures to say, “Hey, there's potentially
    water in the material that's reflecting sunlight that we're looking at.” And that's
    useful information. Of course, stellar astronomers are interested in stars and
    all kinds of things, where you’re looking at emission lines and all manner of
    information that you're seeing across the spectrum. Certainly, radio waves are
    in the spectrum as well, they’re just much larger – way down the road. But yeah,
    it's fascinating.
  sec: 880
  time: '14:40'
  who: Daynan
- header: Determining the features of an object in space
- line: Maybe we'll get into that a bit later. But from what I understood – there
    is an object in space, like an asteroid, and it reflects the Sun. The sun is shining
    on it, the light is there, and then it reflects light. So the light goes towards
    the Earth, where we capture the light. And different objects in space reflect
    the light differently. Depending on how they reflect, you can understand what
    this thing is made of, and if there is water or if there is something else. Is
    that correct?
  sec: 1004
  time: '16:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Absolutely. Yeah. Photometry is basically the analysis of the flux
    of light – photons. That can help give you a sense of brightness and potentially
    size. But if you think about it, size is important because it's variable. You
    could have a very small, but a very bright object. You could also have an object
    that's very bright that's very close to you. Or if it's very dim – is it far away?
    Or is it dim because it's small? Or is it dim because it's just darker material?
    You have to know these things. So if we're looking at asteroids, it's really,
    really important for us to know where that asteroid is – meaning we have an understanding
    of its orbit. If we know where it is relative to us, as the observer, and we know
    the angle of the Sun and us, that gives us some sort of constant at least. And
    then if we look at the brightness of the object, we can start to derive things
    like the size of the object, as well as the reflectiveness of the material of
    the object. Because we don't know one of those for sure, there has to be some
    level of estimation that goes into that. And that can be interesting.
  sec: 1045
  time: '17:25'
  who: Daynan
- line: You also can see even, in some instances, the rotational speed of the asteroid
    as it's tumbling based on the light curve. If you look at the changes in the light
    over a period of time – and now we're talking minutes or hours, really – you can
    see that light curve and infer rotational speed and potentially even the shape
    of the object. The polarization of light polarimetry is another potentially underestimated
    tool, I think, in terms of understanding how the reflected light can tell us about
    the shape of the object. And, of course, spectroscopy, obviously, if you're looking
    at what the material is, that's being reflected. Of course, that doesn't necessarily
    mean that's the material inside the objects. To do that, you might want to look
    at muons or magnetoscopes, or all kinds of interesting things that are possible,
    but potentially expensive. [chuckles] We're not necessarily doing that right off
    the bat, but those are things that we might look at down the road.
  sec: 1045
  time: '17:25'
  who: Daynan
- line: So the features in this case are the rotational speed, how light reflects
    from the object also over time, polarization of light, and all these things. I
    guess, if we think about classical machine learning, these are the features and
    then the target is – one if there is water, zero if there is no water.
  sec: 1175
  time: '19:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think there's another angle to this that's also interesting from the
    machine learning context. When you're looking for water, you can't really look
    at it from a telescope on the surface of the Earth. The reason is, you have to
    look through the atmosphere, which, as we know, is full of water. Therefore most
    of the telescopes don't even have a filter at that wavelength. If they did, you
    would just see a bunch of white noise. So unfortunately, there's not a lot of
    data we can get in the three micron range from Earth. However, we've noticed that
    there's a high correlation of features around 700 nanometers that may represent
    iron oxides or something (I don't know if the top of my head) but there's a high
    correlation of those with water-bearing objects.
  sec: 1196
  time: '19:56'
  who: Daynan
- line: There's a potential opportunity to think about classifying an object based
    on features of its spectral signature – its spectral signature is sequential data,
    similar to a time series. So you do have to be careful because you're not looking
    at individual dimensions that are independent, as you would maybe in other scenarios.
    If you know about time series, you know that there's a lot you have to think about
    in terms of how one component relates to the preceding and following components.
    But if you do that, to some degree, you can classify objects using spectral signatures.
  sec: 1196
  time: '19:56'
  who: Daynan
- line: That's a big area that we're looking into. Because there's only a small relative
    sample size of objects that we have spectral signals for, and some of those are
    sparse. Depending on the object's location relative to us, they might also look
    differently. So there's an opportunity for us to use machine learning to help
    identify and classify those patterns in a way that may be more challenging for
    humans to do. And can we extrapolate that against objects that we don't have spectral
    data for? But we may have other data in terms of their albedo or even their orbits
    will give us information about where they're coming from. So pulling that all
    together and making some inference around it is a big part of the job. And I think
    a lot of it can be supplemented and enhanced quite a bit by some machine learning
    techniques.
  sec: 1196
  time: '19:56'
  who: Daynan
- header: Ground truth for space objects
- line: Where do the labels come from? Do you actually go there and check if there
    is water?
  sec: 1320
  time: '22:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Another great question. So ground truth – very difficult to find in astronomy.
    If you're looking at objects that are measured in millions of kilometers, which
    is a pretty short distance when you're in a domain that measures things in light
    years. So yeah, ground truth is not something we have a lot of, but it's not zero.
    We do have some. As a matter of fact – and some folks don't know this – the Japanese
    Space Agency has sent a couple of missions (the Hayabusa missions) that have collected
    samples from asteroids. Recently, an asteroid called Ryugu – they brought back
    samples and they published some analysis on that. So we've actually been able
    to look at material they brought back from an asteroid. And it's really fascinating,
    because you can see some subtle differences in the material, not only from what
    we're looking at from telescopes on the ground, but even the spacecraft itself
    that was hovering around the asteroid for a couple of weeks and doing remote characterization
    work, there were even things that we're finding from the sample that were slightly
    different than what we would have anticipated there. So there is ground truth.
    There's also the Osiris Rex, which is a NASA mission that's returning, and we'll
    get that sample sometime later this year. So there actually is data that we can
    look at to compare, but a sample size of 2-3 is pretty small.
  sec: 1327
  time: '22:07'
  who: Daynan
- line: The other thing that we can actually look at are meteorites. Meteorites are,
    of course, asteroids that made it through and impacted the Earth. There's a lot
    we can learn from that. Of course, if you have a physical sample – and there are
    tens of thousands of samples that we have so far – you can analyze that in any
    manner of ways with very, very intense laboratory instruments. There's a lot of
    that work that's been done. You can potentially use that to extrapolate to the
    families of asteroids that we think are out there in space. We have to be aware
    of some very important things like, if it came through the atmosphere, that intense
    process has changed the chemistry of that object or potentially changed it, so
    it's not a direct comparison. But there is some way that you can look at that
    detailed data on a meteorite and link it to asteroids. Actually now that more
    people are watching the skies, we're able to, in fact, see trajectories of meteorites
    as they're entering the atmosphere. And then if we actually find that object,
    because we have videotaped it, we can actually see its orbit and that gives us
    more information about where this thing is coming from.
  sec: 1327
  time: '22:07'
  who: Daynan
- line: So yeah, ground truth is very difficult. Also, a big part of my job is really
    thinking about how we can validate our models when we are absent that information.
    Debiasing the models based on what observational data we have is critical. But,
    candidly, understanding bias in our models is a major challenge. We can find consistency
    in terms of spectral classification, for example. We may find a classifier that
    very consistently produces results and therefore reduces variance. Well, that's
    great, but as many know, reducing variance is only okay, as long as you're not
    increasing bias – or if you're not paying attention to bias. We don't want to
    be more certain about something that's wrong. That is not an easy thing to answer.
    It's also an emphasis why we're thinking about cheaper ways to send spacecraft
    to analyze these objects – to get more ground truth data – because that's really
    the best way we think to understand these mysterious beasts that we're after.

- line: I think many of us are wondering now – why would you care about water in asteroids?
    The first time I heard about what you do, I thought, “Okay, mining asteroids.
    You probably want to extract some precious metals and then sell them here on Earth.”
    Why water? We have a lot of water on Earth, why should we care about this?
  sec: 1542
  time: '25:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, very good question. Well, scientifically, water is really interesting.
    Water is so important, obviously, to life and may contain other things, including
    organic compounds or other things that tell us about how the solar system is generated.
    But from a commercial standpoint, water is important for a concept that I think
    is really important that not many people have heard about, which is ISRU (in situ
    resource utilization). The idea with this concept is that the space economy itself
    is real. It exists and it is growing. So when we think of space, we think satellites,
    which are of course important. If the satellites failed, our life would come to
    a halt. The infrastructure that they produce in terms of communication and infrastructure
    of the internet is immense, among other things.
  sec: 1567
  time: '26:07'
  who: Daynan
- line: These satellites are starting to potentially crash into each other, figuring
    out how to clear the debris, how to service the satellites – this is becoming
    an industry in and of itself that's incredibly important. But even related to
    that is the idea of how to refuel these satellites, how to do more manufacturing
    and activities and research and space. There are currently, I believe, four private
    space stations being planned in the coming years. They will be up there. As we
    know, the International Space Station's end of life is in the next few years,
    and there's no government plan to replace it.
  sec: 1567
  time: '26:07'
  who: Daynan
- line: All these commercial activities are in process and manufacturing of certain
    things – fiber optic cables, you name it – may benefit from low gravity. Not even
    to mention activity on the Moon or Mars, if we think about expanding as a species.
    None of this happens without resources – resources that we currently have to bring
    from the Earth. This includes water, which is a terrible cargo to lift from the
    ground. It's heavy, it takes up a lot of space. Rocket fuel is dependent on oxygen
    – of course, water can be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen. I don't know the
    exact numbers, but something like for every one part of rocket fuel, you need
    several parts of oxygen.
  sec: 1567
  time: '26:07'
  who: Daynan
- line: These rockets that are launching – the weight – a lot of it is oxygen itself.
    If we can find a way to get water from asteroids – that are actually pretty accessible
    in terms of gravity – if we can find them and go to them, the delta V (the change
    in velocity) required to do that, is maybe less so than even going to the Moon
    and coming back from the surface of the Moon, just given gravity. Then, we think
    we have a viable option in terms of finding water and bringing it back. It costs
    several thousands of dollars to get a liter of water up into orbit right now.
    Way more to get it beyond that. So if we're able to bring that to the space economy
    and deliver it to customers who use it for various things – that's the business
    model we're working towards.
  sec: 1575
  time: '26:15'
  who: Daynan
- line: Of course, the long term view is certainly resources writ large. If we come
    up with the flywheel that allows us to find these asteroids, bring back material,
    refine it, and deliver it – we can do that scalability – yes, now we're looking
    at other materials. Rare earth elements, precious metals. There's something that
    we can think about there. The sensation is, “Oh, we're gonna find an asteroid
    full of platinum.” Yeah, they certainly have those resources, we believe. Most
    of the material we're digging up in the Earth's crust came from asteroids,  we
    also believe. Or at least that's a heavy source of that. But I think the infrastructure
    has to be in place, there has to be an ability to actually sustainably get that
    stuff, not to mention how you would bring that back to Earth.
  sec: 1575
  time: '26:15'
  who: Daynan
- line: There are big, big challenges – even in the economics of it. What's the cost
    of platinum now versus what it'll be in 15 years? I don't know. It's a good question.
    I know diesel engines are a big driver of platinum. Are we going to be driving
    diesel engines as much? Maybe, maybe not. So there's sort of an economics question
    there that we don't want to have to tackle if we know that there's an immediate
    need for certain resources, like water, that are more attractive to customers
    that currently exist, actually. So that's kind of our focus.

- header: Other useful resources that can be found in asteroids
- line: What else can you find on asteroids? You mentioned platinum, but I think it
    was a good example of an expensive thing on Earth that can potentially sell, but
    it's just too difficult to extract. But what is there in addition to water that
    could immediately be useful?
  sec: 1818
  time: '30:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. There's a lot of unknowns there. I think that's the big question – what
    materials really are available. This isn't an asteroid that we're gonna go after
    – it's in the main belt, so it's too far away for us. But there's a mission that's
    going after Psyche, which we believe is potentially a planetesimal core – it might
    be the core of a planet, or a planetesimal object, where the rocky layer was smashed
    away and it's full of metal. So iron and all kinds of metal that you can think
    of. There may be other asteroids that are components of that. So any type of metal
    that you're interested in, including precious metals, are certainly to be found
    there.
  sec: 1838
  time: '30:38'
  who: Daynan
- line: From a scientific perspective, the idea of organic compounds is pretty intriguing.
    You can think of these asteroids as essentially fossil records of the solar system.
    They're essentially as old as the solar system. But unlike the Earth and other
    planets, they have not been… Well, they've experienced space weathering and collisions
    and other things, but they're probably more of a pure record of compounds. That
    is more of a scientific value than anything else. But I think rare earth elements
    and precious metals, which are all things that we’re excavating from the earth
    right now, are assumed to be embedded in these objects. But we just don't know
    for sure. So that's part of the impetus to us going and finding out.

  sec: 1932
  time: '32:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah. One of the first things we did was hire a planetary scientist
    – an astronomer. One of the reasons we did is that he''s been working with the
    modeling that answers that question. Most people, I think, are familiar with the
    main belt of asteroids - it''s beyond Mars. There are a lot of theories about
    the source of that material – was it a planet that was broken up? Is it just a
    collection of stuff? If you think about the solar system being a sort of chaos
    for much of its early state, then eventually, as things collected into planets
    and they found their groove – I love to think about the solar system in terms
    of resonances. Everything is just sort of resonating and as the planets are going
    around, they''re creating these resonance patterns, which are critically important
    for us. Jupiter is a massive animal – as it''s revolving around the Sun, it''s
    creating resonances with the other planets.'
  sec: 1942
  time: '32:22'
  who: Daynan
- line: Every so often, in this asteroid belt there may be a collision or something,
    or maybe some something will get perturbed, but an asteroid will get thrown into
    an area of resonance, where, because of the gravity of the planets, it will basically
    continue to shape the orbit of this asteroid such that it'll bring it into a near-Earth
    orbit. So when we're looking at near-Earth asteroids, our assumption is that their
    original source was from elsewhere in the solar system – the main belt or even
    beyond that. In the outer regions, there's a region around Jupiter called the
    Trojans, based on Lagrange points. There may be a collection of items there that
    we think for some reason or other were thrown into the near-Earth space. We think
    there may be 300-400 million asteroids in near-Earth space, ranging in the very
    small (so that people don’t get concerned about that). But we think the source
    of those is all coming from the main belt. So our modeling is basically trying
    to understand those gravitational dynamics. There are other dynamics too – solar
    wind is a dynamic to pay attention to, and collisions of other asteroids, of course.
    But we think that's actually the source.
  sec: 1942
  time: '32:22'
  who: Daynan
- line: NASA's JPL has cataloged something like 29,000 near-Earth asteroids. If we
    think there are 300-400 million of them, we're only scratching the surface. Thankfully,
    I think most people should feel assured that anything that's large enough to maybe
    do any damage, we've mostly seen those. There is a pretty intense effort to document
    more of the largest one, so most of the ones I’m referring to are fairly small
    objects. But yeah, finding them exactly – statistical modeling is really helpful
    for us, but as I like to tell our team, we're not able to statistically mine an
    asteroid. So we do need to find an actual anomaly that we can get.
  sec: 1942
  time: '32:22'
  who: Daynan
- line: We think probabilistically and I think we're comfortable with that. That helps
    us, I think, make choices and decisions about where we're sending spacecraft and
    what we're going to find when we get there. But the real question is, “What are
    we going to find? Is it going to be there? What is it going to be?” We'll have
    to start with a sample of asteroids that we have observed and that we do have
    some information on. That's probably the easiest way to do this. But there's hopefully
    going to be, in the near future, more telescopes. We know of a couple that are
    going to be coming online that will be able to see a lot more of these objects.
    That will be very useful for everybody, including ourselves.
  sec: 1942
  time: '32:22'
  who: Daynan
- line: So as I understood, your business model is as follows. There is this main
    belt of asteroid asteroids and then Jupiter passes by and pushes some of the asteroids
    towards the Earth. So you want to detect “On this asteroid that is coming towards
    us or somewhere in the area…”
  sec: 2148
  time: '35:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: The process that I described – that can happen over many, probably millions
    of years. The timescales of astronomy are much larger. So we're looking at the
    asteroids that that's already happened to. They're already here – they're in the
    neighborhood. Now, if you think about the Earth going around the Sun, and it's
    following its orbit, a certain velocity finds a groove, like in a record groove,
    where it's going around. We have reason to believe that there are a lot of other
    asteroids that are also in that same groove, and they're going around the Sun
    in that orbit. But we don't see them because we're on the surface of the Earth.
  sec: 2169
  time: '36:09'
  who: Daynan
- line: If you think about and if you can visualize the orbit coming around the Earth
    – if we were to look at an object that's on the line of that orbit, that means
    you're looking at an object, that is… you've got the sun right here. So in order
    to see that object, if you're looking at it dead on, it's going to have to be
    during dusk or dawn, and the light conditions are not good for seeing faint objects.
    Or if you're looking in the middle of the night when it's a lot darker, you're
    gonna have to look really near the horizon just because of the angles. Then, of
    course, you're looking through a much larger column of air and that's also not
    great for when you're trying to find things. So it's hard to see these objects,
    but for gravitational reasons, we think that there's a lot of them in that orbit
    going around the Earth. Most of the things that ended up making it to Earth are
    probably in this sort of debris pile floating around.
  sec: 2169
  time: '36:09'
  who: Daynan
- line: I think the question is not necessarily that we're looking at asteroids coming
    to us from the main belt – we're looking for asteroids that are already here.
    It's helpful for us to look at the main belt to understand those asteroids and
    what they're made out of. Because a lot of them are larger, we have more data
    on that. And because we theorized that a lot of the smaller asteroids are just
    fragments or pieces of the larger ones, if we know about the larger ones that
    are in the main belt, can we extrapolate what we think the smaller ones in near-Earth
    space are? That's maybe an open hypothesis in some senses. But that's the working
    hypothesis that we're dealing with.

    data. So we are actually talking about a data department, right? A team that does
    all that. Can we talk about that a little bit? What does your data team look like?
    Who is there in the team? And what do they do?
  sec: 2293
  time: '38:13'
  who: Alexey

    working with the data. We have two research scientists. One, as I mentioned, is
    an astronomer or planetary scientist focusing on asteroid characterization. So
    “Where are these? What do they look like?” Then we have another research scientist
    who's a mission design specialist. As an engineer, she's thinking about the spacecraft
    mission that we will need to help develop to actually access these. And then myself,
    of course, looking at the data modeling overall. One of the reasons that we're
    looking to hire a data engineer is because – I've been in many organizations where
    I've lamented that we didn't put enough emphasis on data engineering. That should
    really be one of the first data team members hired. I'm in a position now to do
    something about that. So we are looking to bring someone in. We have someone who's
    helping us with some really important work, but we're still open for interested
    folks. I think this person hopefully will help us think about the architecture
    and the vision of how we're doing this.
  sec: 2319
  time: '38:39'
  who: Daynan

    Planet Center, NASA JPL, ESA (European Space Agency), there's a lot of public
    agencies that have done an incredible job organizing this data, even doing some
    derived attributes, including orbit determination and other characteristics. But
    it still is a field of a lot of specialists. You have astronomers who are focusing
    on one component of astronomy, and they're working with data that’s related to
    that, in contrast with, say, Earth observation, which is the world that I was
    in before. You've seen the market explode in terms of consumers of the data, which
    has helped make a lot of that data a little bit more usable – more analysis-ready,
    if you will. I haven't seen that in the astronomical community yet. Not that there's
    not a lot of open collaboration, but a lot of the data that is provided is in
    fairly complicated file structures, produced by fairly complicated processes,
    as I've mentioned before.
  sec: 2386
  time: '39:46'
  who: Daynan
- line: If we're going to look at analyzing things across these platforms, there's
    a real need for some folks who are used to working with data in more complicated
    file structures. Obviously, image data is a pretty big part of that. But there's
    a lot of catalog data where the statistics of images and other detectors has been
    pretty methodically and comprehensively laid out as table data. So thinking about
    the architecture for how this comes together, and how we can have a really big
    view. I mean, we're building a Bayesian engine, really. The more information we
    can get, helps improve our understanding of the asteroids that we're looking at.
    And all the pipelines related to that – the analytical pipelines related to getting
    that data and being able to analyze it, as well as, of course, the infrastructure
    to support the machine learning modeling that we're going to need to be doing
    and already have started doing. It's all part of that.
  sec: 2386
  time: '39:46'
  who: Daynan

    right now. That's what I'm hoping to change very quickly. I mean, we're all working
    with data, but someone who's really focused on helping us build the pipelines
    for that. And Karmanplus.com is our website and we have a job posting there. So
    obviously, I'll make a pitch for people who are interested as data engineers.
    We’ll also be looking for data scientists and machine learning engineers in the
    future, for sure. Everyone interested, please let me know. I’ll give you my contact
    info. But data engineering, specifically, is the key focus.

    Google Cloud. I'm not as familiar with Microsoft. But yeah, we are going to be
    – I want to say, as close to cloud native as possible. We'll probably still be
    doing some prototyping locally. It's just easier to play around with some of the
    exploratory stuff. But the big emphasis is on Cloud for many, many good reasons.
    We don't want to have to do infrastructure that we don't need to do. We don't
    want to have to deal with the security InfoSec issues that are going to be very
    important to understand. So if we're able to use the infrastructure that is provided
    by a service company like that, that's very useful. On the other hand, we need
    people and we'll need DevOps and our cloud architects who can help us when we're
    implementing to make sure that this is set up correctly.
  sec: 2553
  time: '42:33'
  who: Daynan
- line: Especially when you're dealing with image data, which is similar to the Earth
    observation scenario, the scientific mindset that I've seen, at least in astronomy,
    is – you're doing some kind of analysis, you download all the data that you might
    potentially need locally. So that's a massive amount of data. It takes forever
    and now you're in the data management business on your laptop or your computer,
    if you can even do that. Unless you're lucky enough to have access to a high powered
    computing cluster, you're going to have to be doing some kind of analysis with
    that. Or if that data is in the cloud, then you still have communication costs
    where you're having to move that data when you need it. I think Cloud-Optimized
    Geo tips in the Earth observation domain are incredibly useful, I think. Watch
    for that to grow. And STACC (spatio temporal asset catalog convention) makes it
    a lot more user-friendly for analysts to query certain tiles of satellite data
    without having to download the whole file. That way, they can do analysis in a
    much more precise manner.
  sec: 2553

    the incentive isn't there, but the ability to query some of these dense files,
    as opposed to having to process this in a server where the images are cut to spec
    by some user in a process that's queued up and may take quite some time and it
    also puts a pretty big burden on the data provider. Or you download all this information
    and do it yourself, which is a challenge too. Hopefully we will see more conventions
    like COGs and STACC take off in the astronomical community. But for our perspective
    as a company, absolutely – cloud infrastructure is critical.

    I believe is probably the database of records of asteroids –and comets too. So
    if there's an observation that's reported, that's the place that people report
    it to, and it’s tabular data. They have records of all the asteroids that we know
    of – there's over a million of them, including, as I mentioned, the near-Earth
    asteroids, of which there's about 30,000. Then there's some attributes based on
    the orbital elements that we know from those objects, as well as the brightness
    and absolute magnitude. There's also an archive of all the observations. For some
    of these asteroids, we have observations going back to the 1800s. Those are being

    tour around in Python, which is a popular language for astronomers because of
    the open source nature. There are even a number of packages that are developed.
    I'll follow up with you, Alexey, just to link some of these. There are packages
    that allow you to query the Minor Planet Center – you can even propagate orbits
    and you can do all kinds of interesting stuff with them. If you're interested
    in digging into the data itself, there's a satellite called WISE (Wide-field Infrared
    Survey Explorer). It was a satellite platform that has infrared bands that it's
    capturing. It was reactivated several years ago to actually look for near-Earth
    optics. So the NEOWISE dataset is cataloged in something called the IRSA (Infrared
    Science Archive) . I'll send these links. [cross-talk If you want to go and query
    the source table for single exposures of known objects – not just asteroids, but
    a lot of other stuff, too – that's a pretty fun catalog to play around with.

    start with the Minor Planet Center, if you're interested in understanding specifically
    asteroids, and just getting a feel for it. The JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory)
    Horizons System – they've recently spun up a few API's that make interacting with
    that data very useful. They are also providing additional information, including
    diameter, or maybe some other attributes that they're deriving about these asteroids.
    Their source data is largely still the Minor Planet Center, but there's additional
    information that you can get that people have provided. Again, they have a nice
    API and it's very well-documented. I know they’ve put a lot of work into that
    – the solar system dynamics group at JPL did a tremendous job pulling a lot of
    stuff together there.

    find some stuff there.
  sec: 2926
  time: '48:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, if you're interested in getting into some of the more interesting machine
    learning stuff, tracking orbit determination is a challenge. If you think about
    looking at observations of an object over time, being able to link them together
    and say, “Well, these aren't separate objects. These are the same objects I'm
    seeing. Not only is it the same object, but I can now determine what its orbit
    is.” The process of linking those, traditionally you need several observations
    and you can verify it's the same object, but there are synthetic tracking techniques.
    There are things that people are looking at and exploring where you're basically
    shifting images in different directions and different magnitudes and trying to
    see if you can identify objects that have shifted in a consistent way that indicates
    that they're moving in a direction. As you can imagine, doing that over the scale
    of many, many, many millions, or even billions of images is not a human problem.
    That's a machine problem.

    interested in playing around with this data, Google “scholar”, put in some terms
    and see what's being done. I personally find it fascinating to look up papers
    of things that people have done and try to replicate their methods and then try
    to experiment with maybe some more enhanced probabilistic models or throw in some
    interesting ways to do what they did and see if that changes anything. That's
    a great place to start. If you find anything, let me know – maybe we'll hire you.

- line: You also mentioned that one of the people on your team is taking care of mission
    design. There is a question from Matt, “How do you plan to interact with the folks
    going to get asteroids? Are you going to do this yourself? Is the person doing
    the mission design going to come up with a rocket? Or are you going to partner
    with somebody? What are the options there?”

- line: Yeah, that's a very good question. Thankfully, there has been such an interest
    in space activity in general, that there are quite a few commercial companies,
    in addition to the public agencies, that are building spacecraft. We know famous
    examples like SpaceX and Blue Origin building rockets that are launching things
    into space. They're doing other things as well. But there's a whole ecosystem
    of companies that are building. We're pretty interested in Cubesats. They're usually
    fairly small satellites. Those are being deployed to do a number of different
    things. But everything from the instrumentation, to the propulsion, to the computing
    systems – there's a lot of companies that are assembling and building that.
  sec: 3081
  time: '51:21'
  who: Daynan
- line: We don't find that we're going to need to build anything ourselves in the
    sense that we don't want to be in the business of creating hardware. But we would
    certainly want to work with suppliers and vendors who are. What we need to do
    is set up our mission profiles so that we understand what it is that we need to
    develop. Some things will be off the shelf. So COTS (commercial off the shelf)
    technology is our philosophy as much as we can use that. It's cheaper, flexible.
    There's probably a lot you can do by flying your cell phone through space. But
    there are certain things, especially related to the idea of actually extracting
    material from an object.
  sec: 3081
  time: '51:21'
  who: Daynan
- line: We certainly have some very smart people at JAXA, NASA and ISAS who have done
    that, and we want to learn from them as much as we can. But there are also some
    aspects that we're going to have to R&D ourselves and we’re working with a couple
    of research universities to do just that and develop that. But, in general, if
    it exists as somebody making something or doing something that we can partner
    with or use, that's our preference. And in that sense, we're developing the architecture
    for the mission that's needed. If we have to, we'll look at developing ourselves,
    but that's the idea.
  sec: 3081
  time: '51:21'
  who: Daynan
- line: This mission would not only involve thinking about how to get to the asteroid,
    but also how to actually drill the hole in the asteroid and extract the water,
    right?
  sec: 3202
  time: '53:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely, yeah. I would say that really, for most of what we're looking
    at, drilling is a problematic way to look at it because you don't really have
    gravity. You also don't have a very solid material that you're drilling into.
    You really need to think of a lot of these asteroids as being rubble pots. So
    if any of you are familiar with McDonald's restaurants, at least in the US, they
    used to have ball pits, where they had just these plastic balls that you could
    jump into and play around. You might need to think of these asteroids as being
    somewhat like that. It'd be more of a matter of scooping or scraping or somehow
    collecting that material. That's a major engineering challenge. It's something
    that we're really trying to think about. Maybe we'll find a larger boulder that
    we’ll pluck. I don't know, there's a lot of things that we're looking at that
    are related to that. But yeah, that's part of the overall R&D processes – how
    we get the material and return it. It's a major challenge.

    to pull it.

  who: Alexey
- line: We're not there yet, Alexey. I would like to think that we can be. If we are
    doing our job to build space infrastructure, God willing, we'll be doing things
    like that at some point in the future. [chuckles]

  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] We still got some time, yeah. You know, warp engines is a big
    one. We''re already behind the ball on that one, I think. If I''m not mistaken,
    we''re only a couple decades from needing to actually pioneer some early spaceflight
    according to Star Trek lore. So we gotta get on it.'

    an astronomer currently researching a multi-wavelength counterpart.” There are
    some words I don''t understand. “Good to know that there is a business case for
    asteroids.”'
  sec: 3323
  time: '55:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. One of the things that I find really most satisfying about this
    work is that there are so many people, including the people we've hired, who are
    really interested in bringing the skills to use. Not to deride other domains.
    If you're looking at energy trading, or other things that are very, very quantitative
    fields, sometimes people that I spoke to have found that their skill sets in working
    with derivatives or doing this modeling – they don't have a home in the applied
    science areas. They apply them in other areas. Hopefully, we can be a home for
    people that are looking to put their skills to use in astrophysics and scientific
    computing, looking at some of these challenges. It's a need that we have, for
    sure.

  sec: 3396
  time: '56:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Good question. We should talk about that. We obviously are doing a lot of
    collaborations. At this point, it’s mostly with research universities and there
    are a couple of commercial organizations that we're partnering with, in terms
    of mission design. New Light, I'll make a pitch – you have a lot of really incredible
    DevOps data engineers, and some folks that are really used to working with enterprise
    data modeling. So yeah, let's talk. There may be an opportunity there.
  sec: 3404
  time: '56:44'
  who: Daynan
- line: There are quite a few things we didn't cover, so I'm just taking what else
    we missed. Here’s an interesting one, “What kind of mathematical models do you
    build?” I remember we talked a bit about that before this.
  sec: 3436
  time: '57:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mentioned, I would say, that our overall approach to understanding
    asteroids is taking on the form of a Bayesian engine of sorts. That's a very general
    way to describe it. But we’re trying to understand how each additional piece of
    data or new methods that we use to improve – whether we're trying to understand
    the albedo, the reflective nature of these asteroids, or their orbital elements,
    or the spectral classification – there might be independent models that we're
    using to derive that. But overall, we want to be able to understand “Well, how
    does each new piece of information affect our overall understanding of this?”
    And the Bayesian framework is really well-suited for that. That can also help
    us quantify things a little bit more.
  sec: 3456
  time: '57:36'
  who: Daynan
- line: In terms of the individual modeling, some things are simple. If you look at
    the size/frequency distribution of asteroids, it generally seems to follow a power
    law pretty closely. With basic polynomial linear regression, you can model the
    size/frequency distribution fairly well. Other things like looking at albedo,
    for example, are more complicated because you're looking at sunlight being radiated
    from a body that is not necessarily a sphere. So thermal models are being used
    to do that and there are certainly folks that are doing that research and thinking
    about that. Some things there are getting more complex. People don't know this
    – there's something called the Yarkovsky effect, which essentially states that
    the thermal radiation from an asteroid, based on reflected sunlight, is enough
    to actually push that asteroid. It’s over the course of many years, of course,
    but if it's a small enough asteroid, that's a meaningful force that's being pushed
    on that asteroid. How the asteroid’s rotating and what its surface looks like
    has a lot to do with that.
  sec: 3456
  time: '57:36'
  who: Daynan
- line: I touched on a couple of deep learning and machine learning techniques, certainly
    in terms of vision and object detection. Spectral analysis is really, really big.
    It's gonna be very important for us to try and understand the composition of these.
    And as I mentioned, there's just not a lot of observed data. We're really going
    to need to think about where we can extrapolate the known data and apply it to
    objects that we may know something about, but we don't know their spectroscopy,
    for example. There's certainly some modeling that's going to need to go into that.
    Yeah. We're dealing in probabilities here. A lot of it is just how we can define
    those probabilities in ways that make enough sense for us to make decisions. That’s
    the name of the game, right?
  sec: 3456

- line: '[laughs] Jupiter, yeah. Takes on a new meaning when you''re using Jupyter
    notebooks to model Jupiter orbits, right? Yeah. Well, I don''t know if you have
    a joke there. I mean, I use notebooks. They''re useful for telling the story of
    data. I don''t develop in them because I think it teaches bad habits for developers,
    myself included. It takes on a little bit of different meaning.'

    us today, for sharing your expertise and a couple of stories. So thanks for sharing
    all that you shared with us today. Thanks, everyone else, for joining us today,
    for watching us, for asking questions. I guess you will give me some links and
    I will post them in the description.'

    want to talk to you. As we're growing our team, there are a lot of areas there.
    Certainly we're looking for data engineers, as I mentioned. We'll be looking for
    some other data-focused folks, for sure. But, hey – let's talk and see what happens.
