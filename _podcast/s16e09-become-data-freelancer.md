title: 'Launch Your Data Freelancer Career: Pricing, Outreach, Contracts & Risk'
transcript:
- header: Podcast Introduction
- line: This week, we'll talk about doing data freelancing. We have a very special
    guest today, Dimitri. Dimitri is an independent data consultant. He has worked
    for both corporate and startup companies, in six countries across Europe, before
    he made the transition to becoming a full-time freelancer in 2019. Since then,
    he has worked with over 40 clients, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500
    [companies]. Today, we will talk about his journey, and he will share everything
    he learned – well, not everything because we only have one hour, but the most
    useful parts. Welcome to our interview.
  sec: 91
  time: '1:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Alexey, thank you for having me.
  sec: 131
  time: '2:11'
  who: Dimitri
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks,
    Johanna, for your help.
  sec: 133
  time: '2:13'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Path: From Marketing to Data'
- line: Before we go into our main topic of becoming a freelancer and surviving as
    a freelancer, let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career
    journey so far?
  sec: 140
  time: '2:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I started off studying business administration and marketing. I got
    my first job in a marketing position, but it turned into a data position very
    fast. After that, I joined…
  sec: 152
  time: '2:32'
  who: Dimitri
- line: How did it actually turn into a data position? Well, I imagine that in marketing,
    you have all these paid marketing campaigns – all these different campaigns –
    and you need to effectively measure that. This is how you ended up in data, right?
  sec: 168
  time: '2:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. [chuckles]
  sec: 181
  time: '3:01'
  who: Dimitri
- line: No, okay. [laughs]
  sec: 183
  time: '3:03'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Startup Experience: Translation, SQL & User Analysis'
- line: Very simple. It was a French startup, and they just wanted to translate their
    website into different languages. So I translated the website for them. My goal
    was to then, after the translation, attract users and customers to the platform.
    I have done the translation and, let's face it, I wouldn't call it marketing,
    I would call it more spamming. After I've done this for a month, more or less,
    my big question was, “Who did I attract? Who’s using our platform now?” And everything
    like that. It was a startup for people.
  sec: 184
  time: '3:04'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I was the only marketer, besides the founder. So my goal was basically to
    learn SQL, make the first requests, do some analysis (cohort analysis and so on)
    and that's basically how I did it. I built some very nice infographics. We actually
    used those later on to get featured in some newspapers (French newspapers). That
    was pretty successful. The founder was basically very happy with that, so he asked
    me to keep digging into the data instead of doing marketing.
  sec: 184
  time: '3:04'
  who: Dimitri
- line: You’re originally from France?
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I'm half German, half Italian.
  sec: 266
  time: '4:26'
  who: Dimitri
- line: And now you live in Spain. And before that, you lived in France.
  sec: 270
  time: '4:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. And before that, I also lived in Malta and the UK. Yeah, a little
    bit everywhere.
  sec: 275
  time: '4:35'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That's amazing. Okay, so you joined the company (the French startup) as a
    marketing person. You became a data person because the founders really liked the
    results that they saw (the dashboards) so they told you, “How about you do this
    full time?” Right?
  sec: 281
  time: '4:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Again, I was there full time, but in that sense, yes.
  sec: 299
  time: '4:59'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I mean just data.
  sec: 302
  time: '5:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Because they started learning about their own users, what they have done
    – about the French market, because the French market was their main market. They
    never thought about… Again, if you start a business, most of the time, they have
    the one priority – to survive, get clients. But they never had time to look at
    the data. Again, they actually had pretty good data at the time and that was enough
    to learn more about the clients, about their behavior, so we could build more
    and better customer profiles.
  sec: 304
  time: '5:04'
  who: Dimitri
- line: And then?
  sec: 342
  time: '5:42'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Corporate Analytics: Hewlett Packard Sales BI & KPIs'
- line: And then, after that experience, I wanted to see the opposite side of the
    startup world, so I joined Hewlett Packard – the corporate world. I joined their
    data department in Barcelona. That was basically a data department of their sales
    team. They had 140 people on the sales team – they had regional managers, a big
    head of that, and I was directly reporting to that head, and I was basically supervising
    those 140 people of the sales team.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That was pretty interesting, because we did a lot of… There was a lot of BI
    involved, but also some analysis – we did specific campaigns where even the salespeople
    had to compete against each other. So it was their phone activity, their CRM data,
    combining everything together, specific performance KPIs that they had to hit,
    and we had data about it – sales data. We put it all together and it was great
    fun. That was basically my corporate experience at that time.
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Do you need to speak Spanish to work there?
  sec: 410
  time: '6:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, at that time, my Spanish was very basic. It was basically speaking Italian
    and just adding an S to the end [chuckles] and making it sound Spanish. But in
    the team, everything was in English.
  sec: 412
  time: '6:52'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Okay. Because sales, Hewlett Packard, clients – it sounds like something that
    requires the language that is spoken in the country.
  sec: 426
  time: '7:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely, if you're part of the sales team. But again, it was a European-wide
    sales team, so they had German speakers, Italian speakers, Norwegian, Swedish
    people – it was a big team, again, 140 salespeople covering all of Europe.
  sec: 437
  time: '7:17'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Then did you become a freelancer after that, and you had a few others?
  sec: 454
  time: '7:34'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Education & Transition: UCL Master''s to Data Scientist'
- line: That was the time, basically, where I was a business person, let’s say, and
    I had very rudimentary technical skills – I just learned SQL, basically. I had
    done tons of online courses around programming and reading up on Big data and
    Data science at that time. At that moment, I said to myself, “I really want to
    learn more about this world. I can’t do it only by myself, and I can’t do it only
    after work. I need to dive deep, full-time, into this.”
  sec: 458
  time: '7:38'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I decided to do a Master's program that basically covered data science topics
    such as supervised learning, NLP – various statistical classes. I did this at
    University College London. It was a very challenging year, but I learned a lot.
    Basically, that year led me to my next position, where I earned the title of a
    data scientist, which I was very proud of at the time. Then I joined something
    between a startup and a corporate – I call it a scale-up. At that time, it was
    an online casino based in Malta.
  sec: 458
  time: '7:38'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That’s how you ended up in Malta, after the UK.
  sec: 534
  time: '8:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, correct. Are you trying to map out my journey? [chuckles]
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I think it's quite common for online casinos to be either in Malta or Cyprus,
    right?
  sec: 542
  time: '9:02'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Consulting Exposure: Google Partner & Consulting Foundations'
- line: Yes, correct. Due to legislation and the whole ecosystem overall. Yeah, so
    I basically joined them. There, the goal was, again, connected to marketing, connected
    to data science. It was the first more data science-y project. The marketing basically
    evolved. It was, again, not any smaller data team – it was already a bigger team
    – we were 12 people with 4 data engineers, several data scientists, statisticians,
    and some BI specialists. We were all supporting each other and learning from each
    other, so that was a very great experience. But it was a short experience because,
    at the time, my now wife moved to Germany and I wanted to follow her. In that
    case, I switched and made my last move (my last step) before becoming a freelancer.
  sec: 548
  time: '9:08'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That was a Google partner consulting firm. So now I'm at the Google partner
    consulting firm. They were basically specialized in digital analytics and conversion
    optimization. They were working with all the Google Marketing Cloud, and that
    was basically their core business. But as they had very good ties to their clients,
    and they learned a lot through them, they basically didn't want to stop the relationship
    once those Google products were implemented. But now they wanted to offer additional
    services. That's why they started building up the small data science team, which
    I was part of. While I was there, I basically learned everything to start off
    my freelancing business. Again, it was my first touch point with the world of
    consulting.
  sec: 548
  time: '9:08'
  who: Dimitri
- line: This company – the Google partner consulting firm – they were already doing
    consulting and you thought, “Hmm. Interesting. I can do this myself, too.” Then
    you saw how it actually works, and you made the switch, right? This is how it
    happened?
  sec: 670
  time: '11:10'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Motivation to Freelance: Frustration, Freedom & Purpose'
- line: More or less. I mean, the switch also happened because of, let's say, who
    I am and my nature. I enjoyed all the places where I worked – I made great friends,
    which I'm still in touch with today – but I have this nature, where I always thought
    that it could go better. I was often, sometimes loudly, and sometimes just internally,
    complaining about how businesses should use data. I saw things that I thought,
    “This doesn't add any value to the business. These are just Ivory Tower, fun projects,
    but have no value.” After you complain to your wife for many nights, she will
    tell you to basically do it better and “Do it yourself, then.”
  sec: 685
  time: '11:25'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That was basically the motivator after so many years, because I felt like
    I was in the short range, I was jumping around from one company to another. On
    the one hand this was great, because I learned a lot, but on the other hand, your
    corporate CV doesn’t look that great, because every time you interview, companies
    ask, “Are you going to stay here or are you going to move on?” Which is, of course,
    a totally expected question.
  sec: 685
  time: '11:25'
  who: Dimitri
- line: For a freelancer, they kind of know the answer, right? [Dimitri agrees] Because
    they hire you for a short amount of time, so they don't even ask that.
  sec: 759
  time: '12:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, and I think the value of a freelancer is exactly that – you have seen
    lots of different scenarios, or very similar scenarios at different companies.
    That's exactly the reason why they hire you, because you've seen it more than
    once.
  sec: 768
  time: '12:48'
  who: Dimitri
- line: You were complaining to your wife about not liking certain things and she
    said, “Do it better yourself.” And then you were like, “Okay, I'm becoming a data
    freelancer.” Correct? [Dimitri agrees] What happened after that? What were the
    steps you took after this discussion? So your wife kind of approved. [cross-talk]
  sec: 784
  time: '13:04'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Making the Leap: Resignation, Outreach & Early Leads'
- line: Yes. I mean, there was not one discussion, but multiple. At some point, I
    told myself, “Now, it's about time.” I resigned from the company. I had, if I
    remember right – four months, six months (I don't remember exactly the notice
    period). In that period, basically, I started reaching out to anyone I could think
    of or find…
  sec: 809
  time: '13:29'
  who: Dimitri
- line: So you resigned, but you did not have a client yet.
  sec: 840
  time: '14:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I just resigned because I was a little bit frustrated at that time. I
    thought, everything starts off by basically pulling out the bad tooth. That was
    basically the reason.
  sec: 844
  time: '14:04'
  who: Dimitri
- line: You needed to make the jump. [Dimitri agrees] I had this conversation with
    a recruiter – it was like four years ago, maybe. I remember I had a business trip
    to Amsterdam, and then in Amsterdam, they called. What he told me was, “Hey! I
    have a bunch of amazing clients and your data science expertise will be very helpful
    for clients.” And he said that they give something like 1000-1500 per day, which
    is an insane amount of money. And I was like, “Okay, okay – where do I sign?”
    Then he said, “What's your notice period?” And I'm like, “Yeah, four months.”
    And he responded, “We actually need somebody next week.” I started asking him,
    “How can I become a freelancer?” Because this particular client who would not
    wait for me for four months, right? And he's like, “Yeah, you first quit, then
    you wait for your notice period, then give me a call. Maybe we'll have another
    client for you.” And I'm like, “Uhh… I'm not so sure about that.” [chuckles]
  sec: 856
  time: '14:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sounds risky, right?
  sec: 929
  time: '15:29'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Yeah – because I already had a job and this was a well-paid job. I liked my
    job. Quitting it and waiting for four months for something that might be available
    or might not be – it's not clear… There is so much unknown there, right?
  sec: 931
  time: '15:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, definitely.
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Dimitri
- line: And you made that leap, right?
  sec: 951
  time: '15:51'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Market Research: Cold Outreach to Established Freelancers'
- line: Yeah, I made the jump. I just jumped into the cold water, basically. I handed
    in the resignation. I was already swallowing down a big something that I thought,
    “Okay. Now, I have four months to get ready for this. What should I do next?”
    I did my research, I reached out to, first of all, people in my network. At the
    time, this was the startup network that I've met. I told them that I was going
    freelance, but, of course, I didn't hear anything back from those people.
  sec: 953
  time: '15:53'
  who: Dimitri
- line: The next step was, I reached out to other data freelancers that I could find
    on LinkedIn, for example. Unfortunately, I couldn't find that many – I found some,
    but not as many as I was hoping for. Those that I found were kind enough to jump
    on a call. Basically, I asked them a bunch of questions on how they started off
    and any advice they could give me and…
  sec: 953
  time: '15:53'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Those were people you already knew, or?
  sec: 1020
  time: '17:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: No.
  sec: 1023
  time: '17:03'
  who: Dimitri
- line: So you did cold outreach. [Dimitri agrees] They have a “freelancer” in the
    title, then you would probably craft a welcome message [Dimitri agrees] – a connection
    message, when you connect with somebody on LinkedIn, “Hey, I want to start freelancing.
    Can I ask you a few questions?” Something like that?
  sec: 1024
  time: '17:04'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Practical Setup: Mentors, Registration & Logistics'
- line: Correct. Exactly that. I always like to use my little Google trick, where
    you write things site:LinkedIn/in, so whatever you type afterwards, you only get
    LinkedIn profiles. Then I just wrote down “data freelance” or “data scientist
    freelancer” and different terms like this. Then I got a couple of profiles – I
    was making sure that they are, at that time, based either in Germany or in Europe,
    because I was still in Germany at the time and I had to register as a freelancer
    in Germany. I wanted to make sure that their experience and their advice was relevant
    to my field.
  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That’s why you moved to Spain, right? Because it's so difficult to register
    in Germany as a freelancer. [chuckles]
  sec: 1081
  time: '18:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't remember that it was that difficult, but I made it. I made it in the
    end.
  sec: 1086
  time: '18:06'
  who: Dimitri
- line: There are companies who you can pay to do this for you because it's not easy.
  sec: 1094
  time: '18:14'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Recruiter Channels: Engaging Agencies Before Launch'
- line: Yeah, indeed. But in the end, I made it. I got some great advice from the
    few people that were kind enough, at the time, to talk to me. The last thing that
    I was doing was similar to what you just said – you talked to a recruiter who
    told you that your experience is relevant. I had some reaching out to me before,
    which also kind of encouraged me that there's a need for me out there as a freelancer.
    That's why I thought, “Hey, let me reach out to that recruiter, and not only him,
    but also all others that I could find, and tell them ‘Hey, on this date, I will
    be a freelancer. Find me a project’” That was how I started before I actually
    started, officially.
  sec: 1100
  time: '18:20'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Was it just one recruiter? Or multiple?
  sec: 1147
  time: '19:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Multiple. Again, I had four months, so…
  sec: 1148
  time: '19:08'
  who: Dimitri
- line: '[cross-talk] …DBT, right? You can be with multiple recruiters.'
  sec: 1151
  time: '19:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: You can be with multiple recruiters. But if you apply for a project, you should
    apply only through one. Otherwise, you eliminate yourself – because two recruiters
    will present your profile and they kind of have a conflict, so they will have
    to eliminate you. That's why you can only go with one recruiter if it's for the
    same position.
  sec: 1156
  time: '19:16'
  who: Dimitri
- line: So there is a company, and you know that this company is looking for a freelancer.
    With the recruiter – you select the recruiter who you like more and then ask them
    to represent you?
  sec: 1182
  time: '19:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: More or less. Again, just to make it clear for the listeners – what we’re
    talking about now, I would call this “contracting” and it's a part of freelancing.
    But again, I think it's a specific route that I think just needs to be addressed.
    Contracting is usually when a company says, “I need to hire someone, but this
    person is not a full-time employee but a freelancer that I can hire for 3, 6,
    12 months. After that period, I can basically let go of that person.” And you
    don't…
  sec: 1195
  time: '19:55'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That’s called contracting, right?
  sec: 1235
  time: '20:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's contracting. Again, you have a specific contract with them and
    sometimes it can also be that you are working 40 hours a week for them. So you
    are kind of a full-time employee, but you're not. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1237
  time: '20:37'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Your contract is limited, right? It's only for a certain amount of time. I
    guess both sides can end this contract sooner, right?
  sec: 1251
  time: '20:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Correct.
  sec: 1261
  time: '21:01'
  who: Dimitri
- line: You don't need to wait till the contract is over – you don't need to have
    this notice of four months. I assume it's much faster.
  sec: 1262
  time: '21:02'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Contracting Risks: Dependent Contractor & Legal Considerations'
- line: Correct. There are also things tied to that – you have to be careful as a
    freelancer if you go through this route. There are things like “fake freelancer”
    – different countries have different names for it. Basically, it's like a fake
    freelancer, where the company saves lots of money because they hire someone external
    and they basically just pay them the project fee. You, as a freelancer, basically
    only depend on the salary of one client. Actually, the client (the company) should
    pay the typical legal contribution to healthcare and so on, but in this case,
    they don't. That's why the freelancer needs to be careful not to tap into this
    fake freelancing thing, once they do their tax declarations. Just throwing it
    out there, for those who have thought about it. It's always important to have
    multiple clients. And if one is interested in going that contracting route, it's
    just something to be aware of. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and focus
    too much on this contract.
  sec: 1270
  time: '21:10'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Going back to the recruiter situation, because I am a bit confused. Let's
    say you get a call from one recruiter, they get your CV, and then you get a call
    from another recruiter, and you also share your CV with them. They kind of both
    represent you, right? There is a company where you want to work – I understand
    this is called contracting. But how exactly do you deal with this two recruiters
    situation?
  sec: 1347
  time: '22:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, the way it usually works is – it starts off with a company that wants
    to hire a data analyst or a data scientist or a data engineer, let’s say. Especially
    in the corporate world, most of the companies that reach out to recruiters have
    their own recruiter network. They basically send them out an email to all the
    recruiters saying, “Hey, recruiters! We are looking for this type of profile.
    Find us someone.” So now the recruiters get that profile and they basically send
    it to their network, where there could be a freelancer like me. I could be in
    the network of two different recruiters. Now both of them send this profile to
    me and say, “Are you interested in applying for this profile?” I can talk either
    to one of them, or both of them, and ask them who the client is and get some information.
  sec: 1375
  time: '22:55'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Once I have this information, I could either decide to go with one of them.
    But I should also, for example, in the past, apply to one client – another recruiter
    approached me and I told them, “Hey, I already applied for this position through
    another recruiter.” They will know that, of course, you won’t apply because you
    don't want to eliminate yourself.
  sec: 1375
  time: '22:55'
  who: Dimitri
- line: By “eliminate yourself,” it means that the company sees that there are two
    recruiters who have the same person and they do not consider this person?
  sec: 1451
  time: '24:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct.
  sec: 1461
  time: '24:21'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Why?
  sec: 1462
  time: '24:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Good question. I can't give you an exact answer. I should ask a recruiter.
    But I only know that they always tell me that. Also, they usually ask if you have
    applied to this project through another recruiter, or they warn you saying, “Hey,
    if someone else approached you about this project, don't apply through them.”
    Maybe it's a fake myth. Maybe it's the way that they increase their chance of
    placing you with the client.

  who: Alexey

  sec: 1508
  time: '25:08'
  who: Dimitri
- line: How do you know what to charge when you first start out? Say I quit my full-time
    job and I’m waiting for the notice period. There is a potential client, and they
    ask, “How much do you charge?” What do I tell them?
  sec: 1509
  time: '25:09'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Pricing Strategy: Platforms, Recruiters & Rate Benchmarking'
- line: Again, there are different ways of getting clients. And I have to mention
    that because that depends on how I charge. Let’s just go through very typical
    ways of how I could get a client first, and then I’ll answer that question if
    that's okay. Usually, there are four types of channels where freelancers usually
    get clients, the first one are online freelancing platforms such as Upwork, for
    example. There are clients that put the project on, you can create a profile and
    then directly apply to them.
  sec: 1524
  time: '25:24'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Here, the pricing I charge depends on my experience, my profile, if I'm new
    on a platform like Upwork, and I don't have any star rating, for example. Then,
    of course, it's hard for me to charge very high prices because the client will
    see my profile and think “Oh is this person actually real? They've never done
    anything on here.” So, of course, it's very hard to get into that. But it also
    depends on the nature of the project. If you need some very specific LLM skills,
    and things that are very new, and only some people are very specialized in that
    – maybe you can come in at a higher price because then there's not as much competition
    out there. In this case…
  sec: 1524
  time: '25:24'
  who: Dimitri
- line: In this case – I just want to make sure I understood you correctly. So there
    are these online freelancing platforms like Upwork, and if somebody needs some
    work, they can create a listing. Then you, as a freelancer, and other freelancers
    see these listings. [Dimitri agrees] They think, “Okay, this is the job. I can
    do this job. This is how much I want to charge for my services.” [Dimitri agrees]
    In the job, you see what kind of things they need, so you can set the price higher
    if they require something unique that not many people have. Or if it's a typical
    data science project, and you haven't done many projects in the past on Upwork
    – you don't have any ratings – then you probably should go for a lower price so
    they pick you up. [Dimitri agrees] Then you get the project, and you get the reviews.
  sec: 1602
  time: '26:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. For every channel (every situation) that depends on the client (and depends
    on you) needs to have their specific strategy on how you approach it. In this
    case, for example, if I'm new to a platform like Upwork, and let's say I’m a very
    average analyst – I can create dashboards, I can create some analysis, but you
    can’t say, “I have 10 years of special experience,” or “I'm very good, with outstanding
    experience (or something)” – sometimes you have to compete on price to get started.
    Because your goal is to increase your reputation, get five-star reviews on those
    platforms, and that could be one way.
  sec: 1650
  time: '27:30'
  who: Dimitri
- line: How do you find your rate for this type of channel? Usually, it’s by checking
    out other freelancer profiles on Upwork, seeing what they usually charge. I believe
    platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, there's a premium subscription as a freelancer
    – so you get a little bit more insights about the project. How many other people
    have applied to it? What bids did the other Freelancer give? What range of projects
    did they apply for?
  sec: 1650
  time: '27:30'
  who: Dimitri
- line: The specific bids? I see.
  sec: 1728
  time: '28:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. You can see, “Okay, for this project (let’s just invent a number) people
    bid $1,000 as a minimum, and maybe the maximum was $3000.” And now you come in
    with $500 as an example. But again, it's not just price – there's so many other
    things going on. But I mean, that's how I would approach those platforms. Then,
    the second channel we just discussed – it's contracting and it's basically talking
    to recruiters. Here, I would, again, do some research. There are some platforms
    such as Freelancer Map. I think freelancer.com if I'm not mistaken.
  sec: 1730
  time: '28:50'
  who: Dimitri
- line: There are directories where freelancers have their profile, and you can go
    and scout those freelancers, compare yourself to them, figure out what they charge
    by hour, by day, for example. You can get a good feeling for that. And when you
    talk to the recruiters, usually the recruiter knows exactly what this client is
    willing to pay. Usually they tell you, “We have a range between 80-100 euros an
    hour,” or “100-120”. I mean, usually the client has to tell the recruiter, otherwise
    the recruiter can’t find a suitable candidate for that. So you can ask the recruiters,
    “Do you know what the client is willing to pay?” Then, based on that, you can
    basically pick your number.
  sec: 1730
  time: '28:50'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Here, it's more like give or take – you don't really have a lot of negotiating,
    right?
  sec: 1818
  time: '30:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's sometimes the good part of it, because as long as you tick the boxes
    and you have the skills that the client is requesting, usually the recruiter has
    the interest of placing you there. So they just tell you what the client is willing
    to charge and you can basically say, “Yes, fine with me,” or not.
  sec: 1822
  time: '30:22'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Usually, from my experience with interacting with these recruiters – even
    though I did not lend any contracts in the past – usually they give the sum up
    front, and usually it's quite a good one. The one I told you about, it was like
    1000 or more – it's quite large. I think most of them were lower, but still, they
    would just tell you upfront, “Okay, it's 800 per day. This is what the client
    has money for.”
  sec: 1847
  time: '30:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct, that's why. Their goal is basically to make money out of you or other
    candidates that they are able to place. They will be very transparent with you.
    Their goal is to give you good feedback so that your application basically has
    an impact on the client. The best thing to do is, if you talk to them – be open,
    be upfront, and ask them the questions. Usually they don't have a reason to hide
    things. Sometimes they want to be careful at the beginning to – tell you who the
    client is and things like this. But regarding the application part, they are pretty
    open about that. As I mentioned before, there are more channels to get clients.
  sec: 1883

  who: Dimitri
- line: Two more, right?
  sec: 1926
  time: '32:06'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Client Relationships: Building Referrals & Long-Term Pipeline'
- line: Yes, the third one is usually your network. Often, how I see it, and how other
    freelancers that I talked to, with the network, we usually don't just mean LinkedIn.
    People always think that a network is equal to LinkedIn. But usually your network
    is the companies and the people that work in companies that you actually know
    and have a very close relationship with, or at least hold a regular relationship
    with. With those clients or companies that are in your network, if you have a
    close relationship, you hear what they work on, you hear if they're looking for
    someone. A network like this, you don't have it from day one, you build it up.
    It can even start, like what I did. I started out on Upwork, got to know the first
    few companies there, had very small projects with them – nothing that I'm really
    proud of mentioning, in terms of making a lot of money, but it helped to get to
    know the people, get to know the industry, and the business they are in. After
    delivering good projects, it helped to ask them if they knew other people that
    needed my services. Basically those people then referred me to other friends or
    colleagues or other departments – depending on the client. Basically, that was
    how I built up my network and other freelancers built up their network and got
    more projects through them.

- header: 'Proactive Outreach: Creative Self-Marketing Tactics'
- line: And the fourth one is basically the magic of marketing. Here, I think, it
    really depends. Some people try different approaches. Some try the cold approach
    – emailing people. Others are very innovative. The other day, I read from some
    other freelancer that they tried to scout data profiles on LinkedIn that are kind
    of not realistic. We probably have all seen them, where a company is looking for
    someone that has only one year of experience but knows tons of tools and that
    type of stuff. The [freelancer] was pretty sure that they wouldn't be able to
    fill that position, so they reached out to the company and told them, “As long
    as you are looking for someone, maybe I can help you.” I mean, again, there are
    different marketing channels, tactics, and tricks, but for me, that’s the first
    channel where people are very creative.
  sec: 2024
  time: '33:44'
  who: Dimitri
- line: So if you would, say, post regularly on LinkedIn, and, among other posts,
    also kind of advertise your services that would be the fourth channel, right?
  sec: 2084
  time: '34:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. For example, self-marketing, let's call it this.
  sec: 2093
  time: '34:53'
  who: Dimitri
- line: It's also called outreach. And if somebody finds you through… I guess if it's
    your friend or another company, then that would be the third approach – network.
    And if they find you through your LinkedIn post, that would be the fourth one,
    right?
  sec: 2099

  sec: 2115
  time: '35:15'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Okay. 20 minutes ago, you said that there is a distinction (there is difference)
    between contracting and freelancing? [Dimitri agrees] Contracting is the second
    approach where we have recruiters, but what is freelancing? How is it different?
    What's the difference between these two?
  sec: 2117
  time: '35:17'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Independence & Offerings: Freelance Business Model Explained'
- line: Well, I would say that, first of all, as a freelancer, you are a business
    entity. Basically, this means that you are independent – independent from other
    companies. You're not an employee, you work at the time you want, you work for
    the rate you want, you work at the place you want – no company can tell you where
    to work from. So that's the first thing. Contracting is just one sub… It's part
    of freelancing, but it's one, I think, bucket below it, basically, where you can
    say as a freelancer “Yes, I’m freelancing on Upwork and doing some projects there.
    I have my network. Maybe I have a contracting project going on with a client.”
    So there are different ways. But the important part is that a freelancer is independent,
    in all senses, basically. It's their own business entity.
  sec: 2137
  time: '35:37'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Let's say that with Upwork, you don't necessarily have any strict contracts
    that are 12-20 pages long that you sign, like you do in Germany, right? It's more
    through the platform. Right?
  sec: 2191
  time: '36:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Well, you sign the terms and conditions.
  sec: 2204
  time: '36:44'
  who: Dimitri
- line: But it's not… I guess the contracts there are different from what you would
    get, let's say, if you worked on-site with a client for only four months, right?
    That would be the contract. While online freelancing in Upwork, it's remote, more
    flexible and maybe the contract is different, right?
  sec: 2208
  time: '36:48'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Contract Formats: Platform Terms vs Direct Agreements'
- line: Yes, correct. It all depends on the contract and the nature. Also, each channel
    has their own nature of projects. As you can imagine, Upwork has tons of projects,
    which are very small and limited in terms of quick ones to turn around. Yes, sometimes
    they outsource – smaller companies or even large companies are on there looking
    for, similar to contracting, where they try to hire you for a long period of time.
    But the goal is usually – that's the good thing about Upwork – it kind of tries
    to keep down in terms of a project. Whereas, if you signed through a recruiter,
    there's usually a very defined contract made through them, between you, the contractor,
    and the end client.
  sec: 2230
  time: '37:10'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Let's say you find a company through your network. Let's take Zalando as an
    example, which is a large online ecommerce platform. There are freelancers who
    might represent Zalando and there are people in the company who you know – who
    can tell you, “Okay, we're looking for a freelancer.” In one case, with a recruiter,
    you have the recruiter who helps you with the process, who probably knows what
    the contract should look like and all that. And in the other case, there is nobody
    in-between – it's just you and the company, right? [Dimitri agrees] Is it still
    called contracting?

- header: 'Direct Client Work: Project Pricing, Subcontracting & Cutting the Middleman'
- line: Good question. I never thought about it this way. You caught me off guard.
    [chuckles] In that sense, that's the beauty. If you go through a middleman, which
    is the agency or the recruiter, the relationship is very much defined by them
    – by them and Zalando. Basically, you're just a service provider. If I have a
    contract at Zalando, and I can work directly with them, I usually have a whole
    way of framing the whole project. It might be completely different – maybe they
    need a marketing data scientist for their media mix modeling, for example. Now
    they say, “Hey, we need for four months some data scientist that can help us through
    that.” Then they talk to the recruiter, the recruiter finds me, and I can work
    with them.
  sec: 2330
  time: '38:50'
  who: Dimitri
- line: But if they would have talked to me directly, I might have said “Yes, I can
    build that with you, but I can also bring on maybe some subcontractors that I
    work with.” Instead of selling my time by the hour, I could have used different
    pricing models for that. I could have framed those more as a project, for example.
    So that's the freedom that you have when you can talk directly to the end client.
    That's why I wouldn't call that contracting that much, compared to the first approach
    with a recruiter.
  sec: 2330
  time: '38:50'
  who: Dimitri

    option with the recruiter is better? Or which one is better?
  sec: 2418
  time: '40:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you start out and you have a contact at Zalando, and you know exactly how
    to deliver everything, why go with a recruiter? You already know what you're gonna
    deliver. But most people who start out don't have the network yet. Usually, going
    with a recruiter is the easy way in. To be honest, yes, the recruiter will take
    part of the budget, basically. But you also have kind of a secure first project
    with a nice contract. Usually, it's a safe way in. At least, it gives you some
    money for the beginning. The agency or the recruiter has their agreement with
    the end company on how they get the money, and you, as a freelancer, get the money
    from the agency. Sometimes you have a contract where they pay you out every two
    weeks, every four weeks, or every month. That could be kind of a small salary,
    especially at the beginning, I think that could be a nice way in.
  sec: 2429
  time: '40:29'
  who: Dimitri
- line: With agencies, I assume they have some sort of agreement – “noncompete” or
    how it's called – where after your contract for four months ended, let's say,
    and somebody from Zalando, says “Psst. I have a project here, but don't tell your
    recruiter.” It's probably not going to work. You still need to work through the
    recruiter.
  sec: 2507
  time: '41:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, you don't have to. Contracts are there to be broken. It really depends.
    If there's such a case… There's also an incentive for both parties to skip the
    recruiter, because they pay less, you earn more. You basically meet in the middle,
    because now what the recruiter was taking up, that's what you basically split
    in half. So there's a benefit for both of you. Usually companies like Zalando
    also have a strategic interest of having a long-term relationship with those recruiters
    and that's why they go by these rules and stick to that. They already have their
    process set up – they're not that easily corruptible. It's a similar thing on
    Upwork, where you're supposed to do all the projects on Upwork. But who says that
    after your project, you can’t take the client and you both go outside of Upwork?
    Now you know each other, you trust each other, and it’s a different thing. That
    one is also possible, for example.
  sec: 2534

- header: 'Vetting Clients: Ratings, Company Research & Payment Assurance'
- line: There is another question. I think you've partly answered it, but maybe there
    is something else you want to say about that. “How do you go about looking for
    freelance jobs? Do you have any favorite websites to vet the requestor? Is there
    any way to vet the requestor to make sure that they actually pay after the project
    is done?” There seem to be two questions in one. We can start with the first one.
    “How do you go about looking for freelance jobs?” And I think you kind of gave
    the answer with the four channels. Is there anything you want to add?
  sec: 2621
  time: '43:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. I mean, I can repeat them for the listener. Basically, again, there are
    online freelancing platforms such as Upwork, Toptal… I don't know, there are different
    ones. Then there’s going through recruiters, which are basically already connected
    to the end client. Then there’s your own network that you build up with any self-marketing
    that you can do – maybe write your blog, promote your knowledge, have a portfolio
    online that people can see. That's basically the typical way of getting clients.
    The second question I think was about…
  sec: 2655
  time: '44:15'
  who: Dimitri
- line: It was about how good the clients are – their reputation. You want to make
    sure that they will actually pay, so how can you do that? Is there any website
    like Google Maps, where you can see reviews from other freelancers? [chuckles]
  sec: 2696
  time: '44:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I mean, if you go to online freelance platforms, as mentioned before
    – Upwork – you, as a freelancer, but also the client, both get the typical star
    rating after every project. When you apply to a new project, you can basically
    see how good the other party is (the client that you apply for). If you go through
    recruiters –usually, they are real businesses and they often have their Google
    business account Google Maps, so you can also get feedback about them. That basically
    concludes it.
  sec: 2717

    many people had bad experiences with that. I've been working with clients from

    I've had other types of problems, but not that they don't pay me.

    the problem is not that they don't have money, the problem is that it's very bureaucratic.
    You often need to wait until you actually get paid, especially in big companies
    where there is the procurement department, there’s the finance department – they
    need to talk to each other. Then if somebody goes on vacation, they forget about
    you, then you need to constantly ping them. Did you have this sort of experience?
  sec: 2785
  time: '46:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not that much. Maybe I haven't worked with too many large companies. But even
    so, I've worked, I'd say probably at least around 10 of them. Again, so far, they
    have been good clients – they paid on time, were very simple to work with. But
    again, very large clients – there are only a few of them. There are tons of medium-sized
    businesses that do a lot of data work and that have very attractive budgets, and
    they don't have those strict processes. With them, you can very easily… I mean,
    you have a project with someone and there could be a chief marketing officer,
    you send them your invoice at the end of the project (or upfront, depending on
    how you charge them) and they just forward it to the finance department and they
    pay it out. Very simple.

    ways of transitioning into freelancing. Some people do what I call “the weekend
    freelancer,” let's say. “Hey, let me test the waters.” They usually do it with
    online freelancing platforms, because there are small projects on them. They only
    get that small picture of how the whole freelancing world is, because they only
    spend a small amount of time. But at least they can have very good experiences
    and find some attractive weekend projects there. Then there's, basically, the
    transitioning phase where people say, “Hey, I have a part-time job. I need additional
    income.” So, of course, they have more time to dedicate to freelancing.
  sec: 2905
  time: '48:25'
  who: Dimitri
- line: There's also the full-time jump into the cold water – the plunge that I did,
    basically. And there are people that basically try to hustle their way in and
    every time they’re off work, they have an extra hour – they try to get a client
    and they try to build this freelancing gig up on the side, until they say “Hey,
    it's enough to cover my bills. Now I will quit my job and I will move into it.”
    So there are different ways that lead to Rome. Some are more dangerous than others.

    – if you do your work properly, it's like eight plus eight hours per day. Or,
    I don't know, it's 80 hours in a week or whatever – depends on how you distribute
    these hours throughout the week. But it's difficult for your brain to do all that.

    the first place. For me, it was basically a little bit of frustration on how data
    has been used in different companies. But also, I always had this, let's say,
    entrepreneurial urge, where I always wanted to be my own boss and have freedom
    and free time. Again, I have families in different countries – I don't want to
    take vacation days to visit them. I just want to go there and work from their
    place. I think getting into freelancing starts off with a purpose or motivation.

    a way where you can make a very nice living. But it's not guaranteed, because
    you're your own business – there's a risk. One month, you earn a lot of money,
    and you're very happy and very proud – another month, something happens, and everything
    is gone, and you have to start from the bottom up again. Again, you’re your own
    business and I think running a business involves risk. Everyone needs to be aware
    of that.

    this experience?

  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, totally. Totally. The first year I was anxious, “Will I survive? Will
    I make this work?” This year, basically, my first son was born, I took four months
    off on parental leave and I basically stopped all my projects until then and I
    thought, “How is life going to be when I’m back?” I got back and I had tons of
    requests again because I have good client relationships. I have so many other
    ideas that I want to implement and I feel like, I don't know… I always like this
    example – when you learn something new, this new mental mind map kind of starts
    appearing.
  sec: 3119
  time: '51:59'
  who: Dimitri
- line: It's like when you used to play Super Mario Brothers and you finish one level
    – now there's a whole new map opening up, and you start from level one again.
    It's the same thing with being a freelancer. You don't just work on your data
    skills and delivering data services, but you do marketing, you do accounting –
    you do different things. It's never-ending. I mean, if you enjoy that part, it's
    very fulfilling. I couldn't imagine being part of a company, at least not for
    now. There are too many things that I want to try out that I enjoy.
  sec: 3119
  time: '51:59'
  who: Dimitri
- line: The reason I asked this question is – let's say I want to make this leap.
    I quit my job and then started freelancing. But then in a year, I found out that
    it's not working the way I imagined. Then, I guess, you kind of still don't lose
    these skills – you get extra ones, like marketing and accounting and all that.
    But then, you can still go get back to a full-time job. And like you said – you
    don't need that because even after a four-month break, you still had a ton of
    requests, right? [Dimitri agrees] Okay. Interesting.

  who: Alexey
- header: 'Financial Planning: Recommended Runway Before Quitting'
- line: But again, maybe for other people, it's different when you start out. That's
    why when people want to get into freelance, I always advise them to put money
    aside. When I started out, I think I had like around eight months that I gave
    myself time for. It’s an odd number but I told myself, “If you don't make any
    money by then, then you have to get a job again.” Luckily, I made it work.
  sec: 3251
  time: '54:11'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Yeah, I'm just looking at the outline of the things we wanted to talk about.
    There’s one that says “typical mistakes”. Maybe it's worth covering as well. What
    are the typical mistakes people make when they want to become a freelancer – or
    in general, while freelancing?
  sec: 3280
  time: '54:40'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Common Pitfalls: Mispositioning, Mispricing & False Expectations'
- line: First of all, if they’re in it for the wrong reasons – they have the expectation
    that they can earn a lot of money. That's usually the number one that I often
    hear. They maybe have – I just want to point out some cases that I've seen – maybe
    they have a PhD, and they feel they're very educated, they have very good skills
    in a particular field. And now just because they have this skill, they think they
    can command high prices, they don't know anything about how to position themselves
    as a freelancer or how to have a project line, but they still think that their
    value is… They ask way too much, basically. Then, of course, there's this delusion
    when they don't land any project and, in the end, they blame it on Upwork. “Upwork
    is a platform where there are only small projects,” or “Upwork has too many freelancers
    bidding with a small hourly fee. I cannot compete on this level.” Again, those
    people are in it for the wrong reasons, because they don't want to understand
    the whole freelancing game.
  sec: 3301
  time: '55:01'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That's usually the first mistake that I see. I think another very obvious
    mistake that I often see is, generally, positioning. “I want to be a freelancer.
    How do I position myself? Do I want to focus on a specific niche and a specific
    problem that I want to solve? Or am I this generalist that knows some things very
    well, out of all the different ways that I can connect things?” But again, I’m
    not saying one way is better than the other. Some people just say, “You always
    have to find a niche.” That's not always true. It's really about the positioning.
    Even as a generalist, you can find your way into freelancing – that's just a way
    how you deliver yourself to the client. What is the value that you provide to
    them? You have this spectrum of knowledge as a generalist. Maybe you want to go
    in there at the beginning, compete on price, compete on time to delivery – do
    you want to give any guarantees to the client? There are so many ways on how you
    can compete. It's not just the price. Your offering really depends on who you
    talk to, who your audience is, and just overall positioning. That's something
    that I see lots of other freelancers that don't survive, let's say, even in the
    first month.
  sec: 3301
  time: '55:01'
  who: Dimitri
- line: How can I learn more about this positioning? Are there resources or do you
    just learn by doing?
  sec: 3446
  time: '57:26'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Learning Resources: Marketing Courses, Mentors & Newsletters'
- line: I mean, you always learn by doing, especially the hard way. But that sometimes
    can take too long. I was lucky that I studied business and marketing, where I
    learned a lot about that. But there are, I think, overall, different resources
    one could take. First, I think there are some pretty good online marketing courses
    one could take. The problem is, often those people are also very much motivated
    into technical data skills, so instead of investing the time in business or marketing
    skill set, they prefer to do the ChatGPT online course or something like this
    – prompt engineering.
  sec: 3454
  time: '57:34'
  who: Dimitri
- line: There are, I think, also lots of mentors to find out about. Even me – I run
    a newsletter for freelancers, where I try to give advice and try to make sure
    that the advice is always very diverse. It’s not only on finding clients, but
    also on mental health, how to stay motivated, how to organize your work, and so
    on. There's information out there and there are also probably people out there
    that want to help. But I think it starts with the mindset and the purpose of why
    you're in it.
  sec: 3454
  time: '57:34'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Speaking of skills, what you mentioned is, “If you want to start freelancing,
    you shouldn't just focus on technical skills (on hard skills, so to say – data
    analysis, ChatGPT, whatever, these sorts of skills).” You also need to think about,
    in our example, positioning, and this is a concept for marketing. So then, it's
    a good idea to go and get a marketing course, right? [Dimitri agrees] Where they
    say, “How do you position a product on the market?”
  sec: 3532
  time: '58:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Just to name one – because I do them myself, occasionally, just to stay
    updated. There's this new online platform out there – I think it’s called Domestika
    – they basically have pretty nice online courses. Now it's Black Friday. You can
    find them, and they have some online courses for $8 or €8. I think there's one
    or two very good ones on positioning. I've done one of them and I've done several
    ones in the past. I always like to update myself. I like to also see who the instructors
    are who teach those courses, what type of business they have, and how they position
    themselves. Even though they might be in a completely different industry – they
    could be a graphic designer, or other industries. I mean, in the end, we are freelancers,
    and we all try to be our own business.

intro: 'How do you move from corporate data roles into a sustainable freelance data
  career while setting rates, winning clients, and managing legal risk? In this episode
  Dimitri Visnadi — an independent data consultant who has advised brands like Unilever,
  Ferrero, Heineken and Red Bull, worked in HP’s data teams and a Google‑partner consulting
  firm, and holds an MSc in Business Analytics from UCL — walks through the practical
  steps he used to launch The Data Freelancer. <br><br> We cover the full arc of transition:
  career pivot and early outreach, market research and recruiter channels, pricing
  strategy across platforms vs direct clients, subcontracting and cutting out middlemen,
  and the contract risks around dependent contractor status. Dimitri also breaks down
  client vetting, handling corporate payment delays, recommended runway before quitting,
  and common pitfalls like mispositioning and mispricing. Listeners will leave with
  concrete tactics for freelance data consulting — outreach scripts, benchmarking
  approaches for rates, contract checkpoints, and resources (courses, mentors, newsletters)
  to reduce risk and build a reliable pipeline. Ideal for aspiring data freelancers
  seeking practical guidance on pricing, outreach, contracts and risk.'
