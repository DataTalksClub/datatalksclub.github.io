title: Become a Data Freelancer

transcript:
- line: "This week, we'll talk about doing data freelancing. We have a very special\
    \ guest today, Dimitri. Dimitri is an independent data consultant. He has worked\
    \ for both corporate and startup companies, in six countries across Europe, before\
    \ he made the transition to becoming a full-time freelancer in 2019. Since then,\
    \ he has worked with over 40 clients, ranging from small businesses to Fortune\
    \ 500 [companies]. Today, we will talk about his journey, and he will share everything\
    \ he learned \u2013 well, not everything because we only have one hour, but the\
    \ most useful parts. Welcome to our interview."

  time: '1:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Alexey, thank you for having me.
  sec: 131
  time: '2:11'
  who: Dimitri
- line: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks,
    Johanna, for your help.
  sec: 133
  time: '2:13'
  who: Alexey
- header: "Dimitri\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go into our main topic of becoming a freelancer and surviving as
    a freelancer, let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career
    journey so far?
  sec: 140
  time: '2:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Sure. I started off studying business administration and marketing. I got\
    \ my first job in a marketing position, but it turned into a data position very\
    \ fast. After that, I joined\u2026"
  sec: 152
  time: '2:32'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "How did it actually turn into a data position? Well, I imagine that in marketing,\
    \ you have all these paid marketing campaigns \u2013 all these different campaigns\
    \ \u2013 and you need to effectively measure that. This is how you ended up in\
    \ data, right?"
  sec: 168
  time: '2:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. [chuckles]
  sec: 181
  time: '3:01'
  who: Dimitri
- line: No, okay. [laughs]
  sec: 183
  time: '3:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Very simple. It was a French startup, and they just wanted to translate their\
    \ website into different languages. So I translated the website for them. My goal\
    \ was to then, after the translation, attract users and customers to the platform.\
    \ I have done the translation and, let's face it, I wouldn't call it marketing,\
    \ I would call it more spamming. After I've done this for a month, more or less,\
    \ my big question was, \u201CWho did I attract? Who\u2019s using our platform\
    \ now?\u201D And everything like that. It was a startup for people."
  sec: 184
  time: '3:04'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I was the only marketer, besides the founder. So my goal was basically to
    learn SQL, make the first requests, do some analysis (cohort analysis and so on)
    and that's basically how I did it. I built some very nice infographics. We actually
    used those later on to get featured in some newspapers (French newspapers). That
    was pretty successful. The founder was basically very happy with that, so he asked
    me to keep digging into the data instead of doing marketing.
  sec: 184
  time: '3:04'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "You\u2019re originally from France?"
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I'm half German, half Italian.
  sec: 266
  time: '4:26'
  who: Dimitri
- line: And now you live in Spain. And before that, you lived in France.
  sec: 270
  time: '4:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Correct. And before that, I also lived in Malta and the UK. Yeah, a little
    bit everywhere.
  sec: 275
  time: '4:35'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "That's amazing. Okay, so you joined the company (the French startup) as a\
    \ marketing person. You became a data person because the founders really liked\
    \ the results that they saw (the dashboards) so they told you, \u201CHow about\
    \ you do this full time?\u201D Right?"
  sec: 281
  time: '4:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Again, I was there full time, but in that sense, yes.
  sec: 299
  time: '4:59'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I mean just data.
  sec: 302
  time: '5:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. Because they started learning about their own users, what they have\
    \ done \u2013 about the French market, because the French market was their main\
    \ market. They never thought about\u2026 Again, if you start a business, most\
    \ of the time, they have the one priority \u2013 to survive, get clients. But\
    \ they never had time to look at the data. Again, they actually had pretty good\
    \ data at the time and that was enough to learn more about the clients, about\
    \ their behavior, so we could build more and better customer profiles."
  sec: 304
  time: '5:04'
  who: Dimitri
- line: And then?
  sec: 342
  time: '5:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "And then, after that experience, I wanted to see the opposite side of the\
    \ startup world, so I joined Hewlett Packard \u2013 the corporate world. I joined\
    \ their data department in Barcelona. That was basically a data department of\
    \ their sales team. They had 140 people on the sales team \u2013 they had regional\
    \ managers, a big head of that, and I was directly reporting to that head, and\
    \ I was basically supervising those 140 people of the sales team."
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "That was pretty interesting, because we did a lot of\u2026 There was a lot\
    \ of BI involved, but also some analysis \u2013 we did specific campaigns where\
    \ even the salespeople had to compete against each other. So it was their phone\
    \ activity, their CRM data, combining everything together, specific performance\
    \ KPIs that they had to hit, and we had data about it \u2013 sales data. We put\
    \ it all together and it was great fun. That was basically my corporate experience\
    \ at that time."
  sec: 343
  time: '5:43'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Do you need to speak Spanish to work there?
  sec: 410
  time: '6:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, at that time, my Spanish was very basic. It was basically speaking Italian
    and just adding an S to the end [chuckles] and making it sound Spanish. But in
    the team, everything was in English.
  sec: 412
  time: '6:52'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "Okay. Because sales, Hewlett Packard, clients \u2013 it sounds like something\
    \ that requires the language that is spoken in the country."
  sec: 426
  time: '7:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Definitely, if you're part of the sales team. But again, it was a European-wide\
    \ sales team, so they had German speakers, Italian speakers, Norwegian, Swedish\
    \ people \u2013 it was a big team, again, 140 salespeople covering all of Europe."
  sec: 437
  time: '7:17'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Then did you become a freelancer after that, and you had a few others?
  sec: 454
  time: '7:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That was the time, basically, where I was a business person, let\u2019s say,\
    \ and I had very rudimentary technical skills \u2013 I just learned SQL, basically.\
    \ I had done tons of online courses around programming and reading up on Big data\
    \ and Data science at that time. At that moment, I said to myself, \u201CI really\
    \ want to learn more about this world. I can\u2019t do it only by myself, and\
    \ I can\u2019t do it only after work. I need to dive deep, full-time, into this.\u201D"
  sec: 458
  time: '7:38'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "I decided to do a Master's program that basically covered data science topics\
    \ such as supervised learning, NLP \u2013 various statistical classes. I did this\
    \ at University College London. It was a very challenging year, but I learned\
    \ a lot. Basically, that year led me to my next position, where I earned the title\
    \ of a data scientist, which I was very proud of at the time. Then I joined something\
    \ between a startup and a corporate \u2013 I call it a scale-up. At that time,\
    \ it was an online casino based in Malta."
  sec: 458
  time: '7:38'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "That\u2019s how you ended up in Malta, after the UK."
  sec: 534
  time: '8:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, correct. Are you trying to map out my journey? [chuckles]
  sec: 538
  time: '8:58'
  who: Dimitri
- line: I think it's quite common for online casinos to be either in Malta or Cyprus,
    right?
  sec: 542
  time: '9:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, correct. Due to legislation and the whole ecosystem overall. Yeah, so\
    \ I basically joined them. There, the goal was, again, connected to marketing,\
    \ connected to data science. It was the first more data science-y project. The\
    \ marketing basically evolved. It was, again, not any smaller data team \u2013\
    \ it was already a bigger team \u2013 we were 12 people with 4 data engineers,\
    \ several data scientists, statisticians, and some BI specialists. We were all\
    \ supporting each other and learning from each other, so that was a very great\
    \ experience. But it was a short experience because, at the time, my now wife\
    \ moved to Germany and I wanted to follow her. In that case, I switched and made\
    \ my last move (my last step) before becoming a freelancer."
  sec: 548
  time: '9:08'
  who: Dimitri
- line: That was a Google partner consulting firm. So now I'm at the Google partner
    consulting firm. They were basically specialized in digital analytics and conversion
    optimization. They were working with all the Google Marketing Cloud, and that
    was basically their core business. But as they had very good ties to their clients,
    and they learned a lot through them, they basically didn't want to stop the relationship
    once those Google products were implemented. But now they wanted to offer additional
    services. That's why they started building up the small data science team, which
    I was part of. While I was there, I basically learned everything to start off
    my freelancing business. Again, it was my first touch point with the world of
    consulting.
  sec: 548
  time: '9:08'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "This company \u2013 the Google partner consulting firm \u2013 they were already\
    \ doing consulting and you thought, \u201CHmm. Interesting. I can do this myself,\
    \ too.\u201D Then you saw how it actually works, and you made the switch, right?\
    \ This is how it happened?"
  sec: 670
  time: '11:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: "More or less. I mean, the switch also happened because of, let's say, who\
    \ I am and my nature. I enjoyed all the places where I worked \u2013 I made great\
    \ friends, which I'm still in touch with today \u2013 but I have this nature,\
    \ where I always thought that it could go better. I was often, sometimes loudly,\
    \ and sometimes just internally, complaining about how businesses should use data.\
    \ I saw things that I thought, \u201CThis doesn't add any value to the business.\
    \ These are just Ivory Tower, fun projects, but have no value.\u201D After you\
    \ complain to your wife for many nights, she will tell you to basically do it\
    \ better and \u201CDo it yourself, then.\u201D"
  sec: 685
  time: '11:25'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "That was basically the motivator after so many years, because I felt like\
    \ I was in the short range, I was jumping around from one company to another.\
    \ On the one hand this was great, because I learned a lot, but on the other hand,\
    \ your corporate CV doesn\u2019t look that great, because every time you interview,\
    \ companies ask, \u201CAre you going to stay here or are you going to move on?\u201D\
    \ Which is, of course, a totally expected question."
  sec: 685
  time: '11:25'
  who: Dimitri
- line: For a freelancer, they kind of know the answer, right? [Dimitri agrees] Because
    they hire you for a short amount of time, so they don't even ask that.
  sec: 759
  time: '12:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, and I think the value of a freelancer is exactly that \u2013 you have\
    \ seen lots of different scenarios, or very similar scenarios at different companies.\
    \ That's exactly the reason why they hire you, because you've seen it more than\
    \ once."
  sec: 768
  time: '12:48'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "You were complaining to your wife about not liking certain things and she\
    \ said, \u201CDo it better yourself.\u201D And then you were like, \u201COkay,\
    \ I'm becoming a data freelancer.\u201D Correct? [Dimitri agrees] What happened\
    \ after that? What were the steps you took after this discussion? So your wife\
    \ kind of approved. [cross-talk]"
  sec: 784
  time: '13:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. I mean, there was not one discussion, but multiple. At some point, I\
    \ told myself, \u201CNow, it's about time.\u201D I resigned from the company.\
    \ I had, if I remember right \u2013 four months, six months (I don't remember\
    \ exactly the notice period). In that period, basically, I started reaching out\
    \ to anyone I could think of or find\u2026"
  sec: 809
  time: '13:29'
  who: Dimitri
- line: So you resigned, but you did not have a client yet.
  sec: 840
  time: '14:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I just resigned because I was a little bit frustrated at that time. I
    thought, everything starts off by basically pulling out the bad tooth. That was
    basically the reason.
  sec: 844
  time: '14:04'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "You needed to make the jump. [Dimitri agrees] I had this conversation with\
    \ a recruiter \u2013 it was like four years ago, maybe. I remember I had a business\
    \ trip to Amsterdam, and then in Amsterdam, they called. What he told me was,\
    \ \u201CHey! I have a bunch of amazing clients and your data science expertise\
    \ will be very helpful for clients.\u201D And he said that they give something\
    \ like 1000-1500 per day, which is an insane amount of money. And I was like,\
    \ \u201COkay, okay \u2013 where do I sign?\u201D Then he said, \u201CWhat's your\
    \ notice period?\u201D And I'm like, \u201CYeah, four months.\u201D And he responded,\
    \ \u201CWe actually need somebody next week.\u201D I started asking him, \u201C\
    How can I become a freelancer?\u201D Because this particular client who would\
    \ not wait for me for four months, right? And he's like, \u201CYeah, you first\
    \ quit, then you wait for your notice period, then give me a call. Maybe we'll\
    \ have another client for you.\u201D And I'm like, \u201CUhh\u2026 I'm not so\
    \ sure about that.\u201D [chuckles]"
  sec: 856
  time: '14:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sounds risky, right?
  sec: 929
  time: '15:29'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "Yeah \u2013 because I already had a job and this was a well-paid job. I liked\
    \ my job. Quitting it and waiting for four months for something that might be\
    \ available or might not be \u2013 it's not clear\u2026 There is so much unknown\
    \ there, right?"
  sec: 931
  time: '15:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, definitely.
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Dimitri
- line: And you made that leap, right?
  sec: 951
  time: '15:51'
  who: Alexey
- header: The first steps of transitioning into freelance
- line: "Yeah, I made the jump. I just jumped into the cold water, basically. I handed\
    \ in the resignation. I was already swallowing down a big something that I thought,\
    \ \u201COkay. Now, I have four months to get ready for this. What should I do\
    \ next?\u201D I did my research, I reached out to, first of all, people in my\
    \ network. At the time, this was the startup network that I've met. I told them\
    \ that I was going freelance, but, of course, I didn't hear anything back from\
    \ those people."
  sec: 953
  time: '15:53'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "The next step was, I reached out to other data freelancers that I could find\
    \ on LinkedIn, for example. Unfortunately, I couldn't find that many \u2013 I\
    \ found some, but not as many as I was hoping for. Those that I found were kind\
    \ enough to jump on a call. Basically, I asked them a bunch of questions on how\
    \ they started off and any advice they could give me and\u2026"
  sec: 953
  time: '15:53'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Those were people you already knew, or?
  sec: 1020
  time: '17:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: No.
  sec: 1023
  time: '17:03'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "So you did cold outreach. [Dimitri agrees] They have a \u201Cfreelancer\u201D\
    \ in the title, then you would probably craft a welcome message [Dimitri agrees]\
    \ \u2013 a connection message, when you connect with somebody on LinkedIn, \u201C\
    Hey, I want to start freelancing. Can I ask you a few questions?\u201D Something\
    \ like that?"
  sec: 1024
  time: '17:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Correct. Exactly that. I always like to use my little Google trick, where\
    \ you write things site:LinkedIn/in, so whatever you type afterwards, you only\
    \ get LinkedIn profiles. Then I just wrote down \u201Cdata freelance\u201D or\
    \ \u201Cdata scientist freelancer\u201D and different terms like this. Then I\
    \ got a couple of profiles \u2013 I was making sure that they are, at that time,\
    \ based either in Germany or in Europe, because I was still in Germany at the\
    \ time and I had to register as a freelancer in Germany. I wanted to make sure\
    \ that their experience and their advice was relevant to my field."
  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "That\u2019s why you moved to Spain, right? Because it's so difficult to register\
    \ in Germany as a freelancer. [chuckles]"
  sec: 1081
  time: '18:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't remember that it was that difficult, but I made it. I made it in the
    end.
  sec: 1086
  time: '18:06'
  who: Dimitri
- line: There are companies who you can pay to do this for you because it's not easy.
  sec: 1094
  time: '18:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, indeed. But in the end, I made it. I got some great advice from the\
    \ few people that were kind enough, at the time, to talk to me. The last thing\
    \ that I was doing was similar to what you just said \u2013 you talked to a recruiter\
    \ who told you that your experience is relevant. I had some reaching out to me\
    \ before, which also kind of encouraged me that there's a need for me out there\
    \ as a freelancer. That's why I thought, \u201CHey, let me reach out to that recruiter,\
    \ and not only him, but also all others that I could find, and tell them \u2018\
    Hey, on this date, I will be a freelancer. Find me a project\u2019\u201D That\
    \ was how I started before I actually started, officially."
  sec: 1100
  time: '18:20'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Was it just one recruiter? Or multiple?
  sec: 1147
  time: '19:07'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 1148
  time: '19:08'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "[cross-talk] \u2026DBT, right? You can be with multiple recruiters."
  sec: 1151
  time: '19:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: "You can be with multiple recruiters. But if you apply for a project, you\
    \ should apply only through one. Otherwise, you eliminate yourself \u2013 because\
    \ two recruiters will present your profile and they kind of have a conflict, so\
    \ they will have to eliminate you. That's why you can only go with one recruiter\
    \ if it's for the same position."
  sec: 1156
  time: '19:16'
  who: Dimitri

- line: "So there is a company, and you know that this company is looking for a freelancer.\
    \ With the recruiter \u2013 you select the recruiter who you like more and then\
    \ ask them to represent you?"
  sec: 1182
  time: '19:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "More or less. Again, just to make it clear for the listeners \u2013 what\
    \ we\u2019re talking about now, I would call this \u201Ccontracting\u201D and\
    \ it's a part of freelancing. But again, I think it's a specific route that I\
    \ think just needs to be addressed. Contracting is usually when a company says,\
    \ \u201CI need to hire someone, but this person is not a full-time employee but\
    \ a freelancer that I can hire for 3, 6, 12 months. After that period, I can basically\
    \ let go of that person.\u201D And you don't\u2026"
  sec: 1195
  time: '19:55'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "That\u2019s called contracting, right?"
  sec: 1235
  time: '20:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's contracting. Again, you have a specific contract with them and
    sometimes it can also be that you are working 40 hours a week for them. So you
    are kind of a full-time employee, but you're not. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1237
  time: '20:37'
  who: Dimitri
- line: Your contract is limited, right? It's only for a certain amount of time. I
    guess both sides can end this contract sooner, right?
  sec: 1251
  time: '20:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Correct.
  sec: 1261
  time: '21:01'
  who: Dimitri
- line: "You don't need to wait till the contract is over \u2013 you don't need to\
    \ have this notice of four months. I assume it's much faster."
  sec: 1262
  time: '21:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Correct. There are also things tied to that \u2013 you have to be careful\
    \ as a freelancer if you go through this route. There are things like \u201Cfake\
    \ freelancer\u201D \u2013 different countries have different names for it. Basically,\
    \ it's like a fake freelancer, where the company saves lots of money because they\
    \ hire someone external and they basically just pay them the project fee. You,\
    \ as a freelancer, basically only depend on the salary of one client. Actually,\
    \ the client (the company) should pay the typical legal contribution to healthcare\
    \ and so on, but in this case, they don't. That's why the freelancer needs to\
    \ be careful not to tap into this fake freelancing thing, once they do their tax\
    \ declarations. Just throwing it out there, for those who have thought about it.\
    \ It's always important to have multiple clients. And if one is interested in\
    \ going that contracting route, it's just something to be aware of. Don\u2019\
    t put all your eggs in one basket and focus too much on this contract."

    \ world is, because they only spend a small amount of time. But at least they\
    \ can have very good experiences and find some attractive weekend projects there.\
    \ Then there's, basically, the transitioning phase where people say, \u201CHey,\
