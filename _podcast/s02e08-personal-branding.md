  and monetize with online courses—publishing best practices, course design, growth
  tips.'
intro: How do you build a personal brand that actually attracts an audience and turns
  into revenue? In this episode, Admond Lee Kin Lim — data scientist, writer, speaker,
  and Data Science Instructor at Hackwagon Academy — breaks down a practical path
  from first posts to monetizing with online courses. Drawing on his experience at
  Micron and as an independent consultant and communicator featured in KDnuggets and
  Medium, Admond defines personal brand purpose and positioning, then walks through
  the first steps and mindset to start publishing on LinkedIn and Medium. <br><br>
  You’ll get concrete guidance on formats and best practices for LinkedIn and Medium,
  idea generation and content frequency, and the tools he uses (BuzzSumo, Feedly and
  alternatives). We also cover when to add podcasting or audio, offline networking
  (Lunchclub, 1x1s), conference speaking, and overcoming imposter syndrome. Finally,
  Admond explains monetization strategies for selling online courses, course design
  focused on student outcomes, aligning content with your values, balancing frequency
  vs. quality, and metrics for iteration. Listen for actionable tips, tools, and resource
  recommendations to grow your audience and monetize your expertise.
