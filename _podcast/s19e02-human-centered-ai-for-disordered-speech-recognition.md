- header: Using data to create livable cities
- line: This week, we'll talk about using data to create livable cities. We have a
    special guest today, Rachel Lim. Rachel is an urban data scientist dedicated to
    creating livable cities through the innovative use of data. Welcome, Rachel!
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you! I'm happy to be here today. I've benefited greatly from the DataTalks.Club
    courses, and I'm excited to share my experiences.
  sec: 151
  time: '2:31'
  who: Rachel
- line: We're happy to have you. Before diving into our main topic, could you tell
    us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 161
  time: '2:41'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Rachel''s career journey: from geography to urban data science'
- line: Yes, I'm currently working as a data engineer in Singapore, focusing on creating
    livable cities using data. My background is in geography — I have a bachelor's
    degree in geography and a master's in urban data science. I blend qualitative
    and quantitative analysis to tackle urban challenges.
  sec: 172
  time: '2:52'
  who: Rachel
- line: I began my career in data science, applying analytics and machine learning
    to various transportation projects, such as bike-sharing analytics to address
    indiscriminate parking and road defect detection using computer vision. These
    projects allowed me to make a tangible impact in cities. Seeing my work lead to
    real-world solutions motivated me to become a transport scientist. I focus on
    analyzing travel patterns to support long-term planning in Singapore. Recently,
    I transitioned to data engineering after completing the DataTalks.Club data engineering
    course. By diving into data foundations and building data platforms, I aim to
    optimize AI applications for creating livable cities.
  sec: 172
  time: '2:52'
  who: Rachel
- line: That sounds amazing! How was the course?
  sec: 242
  time: '4:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was really good. It covered a lot about building data pipelines and using
    tools like Apache Kafka, which was quite an eye-opener. The course was very relevant
    and helpful in my transition to my current role.
  sec: 245
  time: '4:05'
  who: Rachel
- header: What does a transport scientist do?
- line: You mentioned you were a transport scientist. That’s an interesting title.
    What exactly does a transport scientist do, and what types of organizations need
    this role?
  sec: 260
  time: '4:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Transport scientists are usually needed in the public sector, especially in
    government agencies involved in transportation planning. The role involves applying
    data science in a practical way to public transport and transportation planning.
    Another sector where transport scientists are valuable is transport consultancy,
    such as firms like Sam Schwartz. It's essentially about applying data science
    within an urban context to improve transportation systems.
  sec: 287
  time: '4:47'
  who: Rachel
- line: So, is it about planning where to put bus stops, how often buses should run,
    and similar things?
  sec: 323
  time: '5:23'
  who: Alexey
- header: Short-term and long-term transportation planning
- line: Yes, that’s part of it. We separate our work into short-term and long-term
    planning. In the short term, we look at bus routes, service frequencies, travel
    patterns, and how well services are meeting users' needs. In the long term, we
    use travel pattern data to make projections and plan for future infrastructure
    needs, such as additional roads or rail lines and their alignment.
  sec: 334
  time: '5:34'
  who: Rachel
- header: Data sources for transportation planning in Singapore
- line: I guess each bus in Singapore has sensors to track its location and passenger
    load, right? This data helps you see if certain routes are overcrowded and need
    more frequent service?
  sec: 374
  time: '6:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. We use a combination of data sources. Buses are equipped with GPS
    transponders, allowing us to track their locations and times at each bus stop.
    This helps us identify issues like bus bunching, where multiple buses arrive at
    the same stop simultaneously. Ideally, buses should be spaced out to optimize
    service.
  sec: 407
  time: '6:47'
  who: Rachel
- line: On the demand side, we look at fare card data to understand where passengers
    are tapping in and out, giving us a clearer picture of travel demand.
  sec: 407
  time: '6:47'
  who: Rachel
- line: What do you mean by "tapping in and out"?
  sec: 456
  time: '7:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: In Singapore, we use a fare card system similar to London's Oyster card or
    New York's MetroCard. Passengers tap their card when they enter and exit public
    transportation, like trains and buses.
  sec: 460
  time: '7:40'
  who: Rachel
- line: So there's a card and a reader? That makes sense. In Berlin, people can just
    hop on a bus without any interaction. Sometimes there's a fare check, but it's
    not consistent.
  sec: 479
  time: '7:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that approach makes it more challenging to collect travel data. You’d
    need to rely on video surveillance and computer vision to analyze passenger flow,
    which is more complex than just processing fare card events.
  sec: 500
  time: '8:20'
  who: Rachel
- header: Rachel's motivation for combining geography and data science
- line: Definitely. So, what motivated you to work at the intersection of geography
    and data science?
  sec: 518
  time: '8:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Growing up in Singapore, I was fascinated by the systems shaping our cities.
    I witnessed firsthand how the city rapidly expanded its MRT (Mass Rapid Transit)
    network and developed new housing estates. This sparked my interest in urban planning
    and geography.
  sec: 535
  time: '8:55'
  who: Rachel
- line: I did an internship at the Center for Livable Cities, which deepened my understanding
    of sustainable urban environments. During this time, I attended the World City
    Summit, where city leaders from around the world shared ideas on improving urban
    spaces.
  sec: 535
  time: '8:55'
  who: Rachel
- line: This inspired me to study geography, focusing on urban design, geocomputation,
    and geospatial analytics. Eventually, this led me to pursue a master's in urban
    informatics at New York University, specializing in applying data science in urban
    contexts. This combination of experiences has shaped my current role.
  sec: 535
  time: '8:55'
  who: Rachel
- header: Urban design and its connection to geography
- line: That's interesting. My knowledge of geography is mostly from school, where
    we learned things like capital cities and natural features. I didn't realize geography
    could involve urban design. Is urban design about planning new districts, including
    schools and parks?
  sec: 619
  time: '10:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, but it goes beyond just planning where things go. It’s about designing
    environments that are livable. This involves making streets walkable, deciding
    on the width of streets, placing sidewalks, and using elements like planter boxes
    to separate pedestrians from traffic. It's also about creating safe, welcoming
    spaces where people want to linger and interact, fostering a sense of community.
  sec: 686
  time: '11:26'
  who: Rachel
- line: I see. Why is this field still called geography when it covers urban design
    and other aspects?
  sec: 726
  time: '12:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Geography isn't just about physical features like mountains or rivers. It
    also includes human geography, which focuses on people, migration, and population
    changes. It’s about how these factors interact with physical spaces. Geography
    is fascinating because it’s connected to the real world — what we study directly
    influences how we live and interact with our environments.
  sec: 740
  time: '12:20'
  who: Rachel
- header: Defining a livable city
- line: So far, we’ve talked about what makes a city livable — parks, pedestrian zones,
    traffic management, and fostering community. How would you define a livable city?
  sec: 792
  time: '13:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: A livable city is one where people feel connected to their community and have
    opportunities to thrive. In terms of the built environment, this can include efficient
    public transport with a well-connected network of buses, trains, and bike-sharing
    programs. It also means safe, pedestrian-friendly streets with dedicated bike
    lanes and walkways.
  sec: 829
  time: '13:49'
  who: Rachel
- line: Other aspects are affordable housing, proximity to essential services, and
    green spaces. Beyond physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure plays a role
    too. This includes online access to government services, digital safety, and platforms
    that connect residents, recognizing that people spend a lot of time in digital
    spaces now.
  sec: 829
  time: '13:49'
  who: Rachel
- header: Livability of Singapore and urban planning
- line: How livable is Singapore, in your opinion? I've never been there, but it's
    on my list.
  sec: 930
  time: '15:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Singapore has made significant progress. Initially, we focused on developing
    housing estates, but now there's a greater emphasis on placemaking — creating
    spaces where people can gather and enjoy. We're also converting certain streets
    into car-free zones, improving walkability and cycling infrastructure. It's a
    journey; some parts of the city are more livable than others, but we're working
    to expand these spaces.
  sec: 948
  time: '15:48'
  who: Rachel
- line: Singapore is geographically small and densely populated, so I imagine land
    use has to be very efficient.
  sec: 995
  time: '16:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Absolutely. Singapore practices a process called Master Planning, which involves
    planning 15 years ahead. This ensures that amenities and infrastructure are effectively
    integrated over time.
  sec: 1015
  time: '16:55'
  who: Rachel
- line: Interesting. I live in Berlin, and I think the city is fairly livable. It
    has good public transport, though cycling infrastructure could be improved. In
    Moscow, it's harder for people with disabilities to get around, whereas Berlin
    is more accommodating. It’s fascinating to see the practical application of geography
    and data science. Could you share more about what you do as a transport scientist
    and now as a data engineer?
  sec: 1036
  time: '17:16'
  who: Alexey
- header: Role of data science in urban and transportation planning
- line: Planning a city requires deliberate effort, and data science plays a critical
    role in improving livability by offering insights and supporting data-driven decision-making.
    By analyzing data collected throughout the city, we can optimize services, enhance
    public safety, and promote sustainability.
  sec: 1104
  time: '18:24'
  who: Rachel
- line: In Singapore, we collect a lot of public data, which we share on open data
    platforms. This enables collaboration with citizen developers, students, and research
    institutions. Our data sources include transportation data like fare card usage,
    as well as census and survey data. This helps us understand travel patterns and
    conduct transport modeling to plan future infrastructure, such as rail lines.
  sec: 1104
  time: '18:24'
  who: Rachel
- line: We're also increasingly using data from the private sector, like mobility
    data from ride-sharing apps. This gives us additional insights into how people
    move around the city, beyond just public transportation.
  sec: 1104
  time: '18:24'
  who: Rachel
- header: Predicting travel patterns for future transportation needs
- line: That's interesting because you mentioned predicting where people will move.
    If I understood correctly, for instance, if more people start moving from one
    part of Singapore to another, you can anticipate this trend. Maybe a district
    is becoming more popular, so it's gradually getting more populated. You want to
    predict these patterns to plan accordingly, right? Like adding a new bus line
    or increasing the frequency of existing buses?
  sec: 1231
  time: '20:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that's right. Singapore is quite small, so we actively plan how housing
    estates will develop. This could involve building new housing estates or renewing
    and rejuvenating existing areas. By doing so, we can estimate how many people
    will live in a particular district. From there, we use past travel patterns and
    data on new modes of transport to predict future movements. This helps us plan
    ahead for necessary transportation services, such as adding new bus lines or stops
    to ensure these areas are well-connected to the rest of Singapore.
  sec: 1269
  time: '21:09'
  who: Rachel
- header: Data collection and processing in transportation systems
- line: I see. As a data scientist, you can't do much without data. You mentioned
    various data types, like sensor data, movement patterns, and ride-hailing information.
    All of this needs to be collected, processed, and analyzed. This must involve
    having sensors on buses and other physical means of data collection, right? Then,
    this data needs to be sent to a platform, aggregated, processed, and perhaps stored
    in a data warehouse for data scientists to use. As a data engineer, you're probably
    involved in these steps. Can you tell us more about what happens behind the scenes?
  sec: 1322
  time: '22:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, we work with a combination of data sources. We gather GPS data from ride-hailing
    companies and public transport, along with fare card information about when and
    where people are tapping in and out. In our data pipelines, we have an end-to-end
    system that aggregates this information, stores it in a data warehouse, and processes
    it so that it's suitable for downstream data analysis. We don't just need real-time
    data; we also require historical data to do projections. Long-term data allows
    us to track patterns over time, which is crucial for providing stable and reliable
    insights.
  sec: 1381
  time: '23:01'
  who: Rachel
- header: Use of real-time data for traffic management
- line: Are there situations where you actually need real-time data as well?
  sec: 1442
  time: '24:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, real-time data is often needed for managing operations. For example,
    to monitor the reliability of services, real-time data is essential. Another use
    case is tracking traffic flow during specific events. In Singapore, we host the
    F1 night race, which takes place on a street circuit, so parts of the roads are
    closed. We use taxi data as a proxy to understand how traffic is flowing around
    the closed areas. By monitoring how quickly the GPS coordinates from taxis are
    moving, we can detect congestion and adjust traffic management strategies accordingly.
  sec: 1449
  time: '24:09'
  who: Rachel
- line: What actions are taken if there's a traffic jam?
  sec: 1507
  time: '25:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on the location. If a traffic jam occurs on an expressway, we have
    cameras that monitor these areas, pinpointing where the issue is. Recovery services,
    like tow trucks or other assistance, are dispatched to manage the situation and
    clear the blockage.
  sec: 1510
  time: '25:10'
  who: Rachel
- line: So it could involve police officers managing traffic or using other traffic
    marshals to control the situation?
  sec: 1529
  time: '25:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, a combination of traffic marshals and recovery services are deployed
    to clear any blockages and ensure that traffic can flow smoothly again.
  sec: 1535
  time: '25:35'
  who: Rachel
- line: In Berlin, we often have events like half marathons or marathons that require
    large streets to be closed for half a day. This can be quite inconvenient for
    drivers who need to find alternative routes. These events cover large distances,
    so multiple roads must be blocked. Do you have similar events in Singapore, and
    how do you handle them?
  sec: 1545
  time: '25:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, we host marathons and similar events in Singapore. These events often
    use a mix of roads and our network of park connectors, which are pathways that
    connect different parks and are free of vehicles. This allows most of the marathon
    routes to take place without significantly disrupting traffic on main roads. The
    impact on traffic is minimized because only a few roads need to be closed, thanks
    to these park connectors.
  sec: 1590
  time: '26:30'
  who: Rachel
- header: Incorporating generative AI into data engineering
- line: That makes sense. Having connected parks where people can run without needing
    to wait for traffic lights is an excellent way to make a city more livable. I'm
    into running myself, and finding a route without having to wait for traffic lights
    is always a challenge. It's great that Singapore has planned these aspects so
    well. Do you participate in organizing these events, or are you more focused on
    transportation in your role?
  sec: 1626
  time: '27:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: My role is more focused on transportation. While I don't directly manage these
    events, I work on data preparation and building data pipelines, ensuring that
    transportation systems run smoothly. Increasingly, I'm also looking at ways to
    incorporate generative AI into data engineering, such as enabling users to query
    databases without needing SQL knowledge.
  sec: 1679
  time: '27:59'
  who: Rachel
- line: How often do people need to make these types of queries?
  sec: 1723
  time: '28:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Quite often. As data engineers or scientists, we frequently receive requests
    to extract data or perform specific analyses. Building tools that allow users
    to access insights on their own would free up our time for more innovative work.
    I believe that subject matter experts should drive data science and analysis because
    they best understand their needs and the problems they want to solve. When problems
    and requests are passed through multiple people, the original intent can sometimes
    get diluted. Clear, well-defined problem statements are essential for effective
    analysis.
  sec: 1728
  time: '28:48'
  who: Rachel
- line: Who are the people making these requests, usually? I assume they are subject
    matter experts who aren't necessarily technical, right?
  sec: 1793
  time: '29:53'
  who: Alexey
- header: Data analysis for transportation policies
- line: Yes, they could be subject matter experts, like those working in policy-making.
    They need data to develop data-driven policies.
  sec: 1809
  time: '30:09'
  who: Rachel
- line: Can you give an example of a policy that might need data analysis?
  sec: 1821
  time: '30:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, one example is analyzing fare card data to determine appropriate transportation
    pricing. We might want to know how many people use concession cards, like those
    for senior citizens or students, to evaluate the effectiveness of a new policy
    or fare adjustment.
  sec: 1827
  time: '30:27'
  who: Rachel
- line: What is a concession card?
  sec: 1871
  time: '31:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: A concession card provides discounted fares. In Singapore, for instance, senior
    citizens and students can use these cards to pay reduced rates on public transportation.
  sec: 1860
  time: '31:00'
  who: Rachel
- line: So, policy questions might include things like what happens if we increase
    fares or introduce a new ticket option? For example, in Berlin, there are discounted
    bundles of tickets. You might need data to predict the impact of similar changes.
  sec: 1871
  time: '31:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. In Singapore, we have monthly passes offering unlimited travel for
    a fixed price, with specific options for students. We might analyze how many students
    use these passes and how effective they are in encouraging public transport use.
  sec: 1897
  time: '31:37'
  who: Rachel
- line: And since people need to tap their cards to use transportation, you have all
    this data. But policy specialists might not know how to query it. Are you working
    on making this easier for them, perhaps through a chat interface that translates
    their questions into SQL queries?
  sec: 1925
  time: '32:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that's something we're looking to build. It's still in development, but
    we're working on tools that can help extract information and perform analysis
    more intuitively, potentially using plain language queries.
  sec: 1955
  time: '32:35'
  who: Rachel
- line: Is this a project you're actively working on now?
  sec: 1973
  time: '32:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it's one of the projects we're currently focusing on.
  sec: 1979
  time: '32:59'
  who: Rachel
- header: Technologies used in text-to-SQL projects
- line: What technologies or approaches are you using for this project? It sounds
    like a fascinating application of large language models (LLMs), and it might interest
    our LLM Zoomcamp students to learn about its practical uses.
  sec: 1999
  time: '33:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: In the text-to-SQL space, we're looking at using metadata from data warehouses
    and data catalogs. We chunk this information and create a vector database, then
    apply a large language model (LLM) on top of it. The LLM takes user queries in
    plain English, translates them into SQL statements, and returns outputs to the
    users.
  sec: 2028
  time: '33:48'
  who: Rachel
- line: So, it's like a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setup. A user provides
    a plain English query, and you use context from metadata to generate the SQL query.
    The LLM then executes the query and returns the results. Is that how it works?
  sec: 2040
  time: '34:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly. We use RAG techniques. The metadata helps the LLM understand
    which tables to refer to for the correct information extraction.
  sec: 2083
  time: '34:43'
  who: Rachel
- line: How often do the queries generated by this process fail or need correction?
  sec: 2109
  time: '35:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't have exact numbers, but it does happen. Success largely depends on
    effective prompt engineering. Providing sufficient examples of text-to-SQL conversions
    helps guide the LLM. It’s also important to restrict certain types of SQL commands,
    like insert, update, or delete statements, to prevent unintended database modifications.
  sec: 2118
  time: '35:18'
  who: Rachel
- header: Handling large datasets and transportation data in Singapore
- line: That's a fascinating project. I'm always keen to learn about new LLM use cases
    because there are so many possibilities. It's great that you're exploring this
    space too. This project is in an early development phase, right?
  sec: 2172
  time: '36:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it’s still in early development.
  sec: 2190
  time: '36:30'
  who: Rachel
- line: How large are the datasets you're working with for these projects? Besides
    the text-to-SQL project, are there other more established projects you're involved
    in? You mentioned transportation data — like fare card data. How large are these
    datasets?
  sec: 2192
  time: '36:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: We collect a significant amount of data. For fare card data alone, we gather
    millions of passenger flow records daily in Singapore. This provides numerous
    data points for analyzing passenger movements, identifying peak travel times,
    and assessing route popularity. This data is crucial for optimizing routes and
    fare structures.
  sec: 2231
  time: '37:11'
  who: Rachel
- line: For example, in Singapore, the Public Transport Council implemented a "morning
    pre-peak fare" policy, offering savings for commuters who travel before 7:45 AM.
    This aims to shift demand away from peak hours, balancing train load and encouraging
    earlier travel. By analyzing fare card data, we can evaluate the effectiveness
    of such policies.
  sec: 2231
  time: '37:11'
  who: Rachel
- line: Regarding these millions of data points you collect, how are they processed?
    Do you use standard tools like Kafka, data lakes, and data warehouses? Also, how
    does data from the buses get collected? Are there transmitters on the buses that
    send data to Kafka or another system?
  sec: 2314
  time: '38:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, we have sensors on the buses that collect location information. We also
    gather data from fare card systems at the entry and exit points.
  sec: 2344
  time: '39:04'
  who: Rachel
- line: Is this data collected in real-time? For example, the moment I tap my card,
    does an event get recorded immediately, or is the data only gathered at the end
    of the day?
  sec: 2354
  time: '39:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: The data is collected in real-time, but aggregation happens afterward. In
    Singapore, we use a system that defines a ride and a journey. Our fare structure
    allows commuters to make multiple transfers within a 45-minute period, which is
    considered one journey. We calculate fares based on the total distance traveled.
    So, while data is collected in real-time, processing and aggregation occur after
    a time lag. This allows us to combine all this information before storing it in
    a data warehouse. We use tools like Kafka and Apache Spark for processing.
  sec: 2367
  time: '39:27'
  who: Rachel
- line: So, the events from the bus are sent immediately to your system. You don't
    need to wait until the bus completes its shift to connect and download the data,

  sec: 2460
  time: '41:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I haven't needed to do that.
  sec: 2464
  time: '41:04'
  who: Rachel
- line: So, the sensors are quite reliable, right?
  sec: 2468
  time: '41:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, generally they are reliable. However, part of data engineering involves
    detecting data quality issues or anomalies. For instance, if a transponder on
    a bus isn’t sending data correctly, we need to identify that issue. While I haven't
    personally gone to a bus to fix a sensor, maintaining data quality is a critical
    aspect of data engineering.

  who: Rachel
- line: I'm considering whether to dive deeper into traditional data engineering topics
    or explore generative AI applications. What would you like to focus on next?
  sec: 2506
  time: '41:46'
  who: Alexey

- line: Do you have other AI applications besides the text-to-SQL tool?
  sec: 2537
  time: '42:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: The text-to-SQL tool is my main focus right now. However, generative AI has
    other potential applications, such as creating synthetic data. In projects where
    we don't have a full data set, generative AI could help generate synthetic data.
    Additionally, I believe generative AI could redefine user interfaces, making information
    retrieval more conversational and intuitive, moving away from traditional keyword
    searches to semantic searches. This approach could change how people search for
    things, not just in e-commerce but in various domains, like planning what to buy
    for a gift.
  sec: 2548
  time: '42:28'
  who: Rachel
- line: I'm becoming more accustomed to using tools like ChatGPT with voice recognition.
    It's very convenient. Regarding synthetic data, how effective is generative AI
    at creating data, especially numerical data or time series data?
  sec: 2635
  time: '43:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was speaking generally about the potential of generative AI for creating
    synthetic data, especially when dealing with complex or sensitive data sets. Generative
    AI could help create synthetic versions that mask confidential information while
    retaining essential characteristics.

- line: Since Singapore releases a lot of public data on open platforms, sometimes
    you might need to edit this data before publishing it, right?
  sec: 2726
  time: '45:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: The current publicly shared data is collected from various systems, and we
    mask sensitive information, such as fare card numbers, before publishing.

  sec: 2752
  time: '45:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Two main platforms provide public data in Singapore: data.gov.sg and DataMall.
    Data.gov.sg aggregates data from various government bodies, covering areas like
    rainfall, air pollution, transportation, and more.'
  sec: 2760
  time: '46:00'
  who: Rachel
- line: There are categories like arts, education, economy, environment, housing,
    health, social, transport, and real-time APIs. I assume I should look under the
    transport category to find relevant data, right?
  sec: 2780
  time: '46:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, you’ll find transportation data, such as air travel and geospatial information,
    under the transport category.
  sec: 2801

  who: Rachel
- line: If someone is starting the next cohort of a data engineering course in January,
    what kinds of projects would you recommend they try using these data sets?
  sec: 2810
  time: '46:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: One useful data set could be car parking data, as we collect real-time parking
    transaction data. It's a large and dynamic data set, ideal for real-time data
    ingestion, storage in a data warehouse or data lake, and subsequent analysis.
  sec: 2825
  time: '47:05'
  who: Rachel
- line: How do I find the car parking data?
  sec: 2856
  time: '47:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Car parking data is typically part of our dynamic data sets.
  sec: 2867
  time: '47:47'
  who: Rachel
- line: There are real-time APIs. Maybe that’s what I need to look for. Could you
    send me the link later?
  sec: 2871
  time: '47:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, I can send it to you. Another valuable data set is real-time taxi data,
    which can be useful for examining data engineering processes. In previous data
    engineering courses, we used the New York taxi data set, which is aggregated.
    Real-time data offers another layer of complexity and learning opportunities.
  sec: 2888
  time: '48:08'
  who: Rachel
- line: I see public transport capacity, taxi population data, and more, some of which
    are updated regularly. You've sent me another link, right?
  sec: 2915
  time: '48:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I've sent another link, specifically for transportation data under the
    dynamic data sets, including real-time taxi availability and parking information.

- header: Recommended resources for learning urban data science
- line: Great, I'll add this link to our description. Thanks. I don't see any questions
    from the audience at the moment. I'm wondering if someone wants to study what
    you do — urban data science and transport planning — what resources, books, or
    courses would you recommend?
  sec: 2956
  time: '49:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'The courses by DataTalks.Club are a good primer. For a deeper understanding
    of urban data science, the book "The Death and Life of Great American Cities"
    by Jane Jacobs is a classic. It critiques traditional urban planning and advocates
    for vibrant, livable cities through community-based approaches and human-scale
    design. Another book is "Happy City: Transforming Our Lives Through Urban Design"
    by Charles Montgomery. This book blends urban planning with psychology and sociology,
    exploring how thoughtful urban design can improve happiness and well-being. Both
    books offer insights into why we study urban data and plan cities thoughtfully.'
  sec: 3022
  time: '50:22'
  who: Rachel
- line: Those sound interesting. The first one is "The Death and Life of Great American
    Cities," and the second is "Happy City," right?
  sec: 3102
  time: '51:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that's correct.
  sec: 3120
  time: '52:00'
  who: Rachel
- line: I remember visiting the United States, where getting around without a car
    is challenging, except in cities like New York or Boston. It would be great if
    some of the practices from Europe or Singapore were implemented there. I recall
    once being picked up by the police while walking down a road without sidewalks
    because I wasn't used to the idea that you need a car to move around.
