transcript:
- header: Background and career journey of Katarzyna
- line: "This week, we'll talk about human-centered AI for disordered speech recognition.\
    \ We have a special guest today\u2014Katarzyna Foremniak is a computational linguist\
    \ with over ten years of experience in NLP and speech recognition. She has developed\
    \ language models for automotive brands like Audi and Porsche and specializes\
    \ in phonetics, morpho-syntax, and sentiment analysis. Katarzyna also teaches\
    \ at the University of Warsaw and is passionate about human-centered AI and multilingual\
    \ NLP. Welcome to the show!"

  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. I'm very happy and honored to be here with you today.

  who: Katarzyna
- line: How accurate was the bio? I asked GPT to summarize my longer bio, so I hope
    it was accurate.
  sec: 527
  time: '8:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, it was accurate. It was quite rich for a summary.

  who: Katarzyna
- header: Transition from linguistics to computational linguistics
- line: "Before we dive into our main topic of human-centered AI and speech recognition,\
    \ let\u2019s start with your background. I think GPT already provided a lot of\
    \ good insights, but could you tell us more about your career journey?"
  sec: 546
  time: '9:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Sure. I\u2019m a computational linguist, which is a short answer. On one\
    \ hand, I\u2019m a researcher and a teacher at the Department of Italian Studies\
    \ in the Faculty of Modern Languages at the University of Warsaw. On the other\
    \ hand, I work on NLP projects in the automotive industry and collaborate with\
    \ companies in data handling. My background is mainly in linguistics, which was\
    \ my starting point. I studied Italian and Polish in parallel and added some technical\
    \ skills along the way, leading me to my journey as a computational linguist.\
    \ My main field of interest is phonetics, which is why this topic is relevant\
    \ for today's meeting. Sorry for being a bit lengthy!"
  sec: 561
  time: '9:21'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "It wasn\u2019t long at all. I\u2019m curious, to be a linguist in Italian,\
    \ do you have to speak Italian perfectly?"
  sec: 642
  time: '10:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: It helps!
  sec: 655
  time: '10:55'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: Do you speak it well?
  sec: 658
  time: '10:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I do.
  sec: 658
  time: '10:58'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: I usually go to Italy as a tourist. The funny thing is that I live in Germany,
    and when I go to places like Garda, which is a popular vacation destination for
    Germans, people just look at me and start speaking German.
  sec: 660
  time: '11:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Maybe that\u2019s why! Italians are usually very open and appreciate it when\
    \ you speak their language."
  sec: 681
  time: '11:21'
  who: Katarzyna
- header: Merging linguistics and computer science
- line: "I\u2019m curious about how difficult it was for you to transition from linguist\
    \ to computational linguist. Linguistics, as I understand it, is less mathematical\
    \ than other disciplines."
  sec: 698
  time: '11:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: There was an audio problem; I only caught the first part of your question.
  sec: 707
  time: '11:47'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "How difficult was it for you to become a computational linguist? It seems\
    \ like linguistics isn\u2019t as math-heavy, so how was the transition for you?"
  sec: 713
  time: '11:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: "You raised two interesting points. First, linguistics can indeed seem distant\
    \ from mathematics. However, it depends on the approach; literature might seem\
    \ far removed, but if you focus on data and relationships between datasets, it\u2019\
    s a different story."
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "You\u2019ve touched on how important the use of data is. Is it safe to say\
    \ that computational linguistics merges linguistics and computer science?"
  sec: 802
  time: '13:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, that\u2019s correct. When I began, there were not many studies in computational\
    \ linguistics in Poland. At that time, it was necessary to acquire programming\
    \ skills along with linguistic knowledge. I had to catch up and was fortunate\
    \ enough to meet several people who were willing to teach me."
  sec: 814
  time: '13:34'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: When you say that linguistics might not be too far from mathematics, I remember
    reading about syntax trees. They represent language in a more concrete way, almost
    like algebra, allowing us to work with mathematical abstractions instead of just
    letters and characters.
  sec: 827
  time: '13:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Indeed, that\u2019s one of the main perspectives in linguistics: viewing\
    \ language as a structured system. This aligns closely with your description."
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: When you were studying linguistics in Italian, did you learn Italian first
    and then focus on linguistics, or did you approach it from a linguistic perspective
    before using the language more practically?
  sec: 887
  time: '14:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I started learning Italian first. I managed to communicate in the language\
    \ before diving deeper into its linguistic aspects. I also specialize in Polish\
    \ linguistics, which felt much more natural since it\u2019s my first language."
  sec: 904
  time: '15:04'
  who: Katarzyna
- header: Understanding phonetics and morpho-syntax
- line: "In your biography, summarized by GPT, it mentions that you specialize in\
    \ phonetics, morpho-syntax, and sentiment analysis. I\u2019m familiar with sentiment\
    \ analysis, but could you explain what phonetics and morpho-syntax are?"
  sec: 925
  time: '15:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Sure! Phonetics is the study of sounds in the language system, focusing on\
    \ how we produce speech. It often intersects with phonology, which explores sounds\
    \ on a mental level. Morphology, on the other hand, deals with how words are formed\
    \ and how they interact with one another. In morphologically rich languages like\
    \ Polish, this includes inflection and the use of prefixes and suffixes. It\u2019\
    s essential to consider both phonetics and morphology, as many aspects of our\
    \ speech are interconnected."
  sec: 947
  time: '15:47'
  who: Katarzyna
- header: Exploring morpho-syntax and its relation to grammar
- line: So we have linguistics, and within linguistics, we have morphology and phonetics,
    right?
  sec: 1048
  time: '17:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, we can delve even deeper into other areas like semantics (the meaning
    of words) and pragmatics (the use of language). However, for today, I believe
    phonetics and speech are the most relevant.
  sec: 1054
  time: '17:34'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "I\u2019m not sure if you answered this already, but what exactly is morpho-syntax?"
  sec: 1078
  time: '17:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Morpho-syntax combines morphology and syntax. It studies how words are constructed
    and how they fit into sentences, which are larger segments of text. There's a
    strong connection between how we use words and their arrangement in the overall
    structure.
  sec: 1083
  time: '18:03'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: How does morpho-syntax relate to grammar? Are they basically the same thing?
  sec: 1114
  time: '18:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Grammar is linked to both morphology and syntax. When we discuss grammar,
    we often start with the word itself, looking at its structure and inflection,
    such as verb conjugation or tense.
  sec: 1119
  time: '18:39'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: So syntax is a higher-level concept, then? Each word is correctly formed and
    used, and syntax governs how we arrange them in sentences.
  sec: 1140
  time: '19:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Syntax is all about constructing sentences and how words relate to
    each other within those sentences.
  sec: 1158
  time: '19:18'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "Is syntax also related to word order? For example, in German, the verb must\
    \ always be in the second position, right? That\u2019s part of syntax, correct?"
  sec: 1164
  time: '19:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, that\u2019s a syntactic pattern."
  sec: 1174
  time: '19:34'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "For me, syntax was always associated with programming languages. For instance,\
    \ in Java, you have to use curly braces. I didn\u2019t realize that the concept\
    \ originates from linguistics."
  sec: 1181
  time: '19:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That\u2019s a great example! It illustrates the same patterns we see in both\
    \ natural languages and programming languages, such as what comes first and what\
    \ should follow."
  sec: 1203
  time: '20:03'
  who: Katarzyna
- header: Connection between phonetics and speech disorders
- line: "When it comes to phonetics, it\u2019s about how we pronounce words, right?"
  sec: 1233
  time: '20:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly, it\u2019s about the production of sounds."
  sec: 1240
  time: '20:40'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: And we want to discuss speech disorders, so how are phonetics and speech disorders
    connected?
  sec: 1242
  time: '20:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: If we speak, it can be in a standard or non-standard manner. Speech disorders
    are examples of communication disorders. They can affect articulation, meaning
    the pronunciation of sounds and sound clusters, as well as fluency and voice quality.
    We might articulate a sound incorrectly, or have issues with fluency, such as
    interruptions or stuttering. These disorders can lead to difficulties in understanding
    speech.
  sec: 1251
  time: '20:51'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: Did I understand correctly that an accent can be seen as a speech disorder,
    or is it simply a normal variation?
  sec: 1399
  time: '23:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: "When we talk about foreign accents, we don\u2019t typically classify them\
    \ as speech disorders. They may lead to comprehension difficulties, but they\u2019\
    re generally accepted as part of normal variation. Speech disorders, on the other\
    \ hand, are often linked to biological or neurological causes that hinder normal\
    \ speech production."
  sec: 1414
  time: '23:34'
  who: Katarzyna
- header: Improvement of voice recognition systems
- line: "That\u2019s interesting! I remember that even five years ago, many voice\
    \ recognition systems struggled to transcribe what I said accurately. For instance,\
    \ YouTube's transcription was quite poor in the beginning. But now, with systems\
    \ like Whisper, they work much better with my accent. Perhaps my accent has improved\
    \ too, but I think the systems have advanced more significantly."
  sec: 1481
  time: '24:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That\u2019s true! The models have improved considerably. Any non-standard\
    \ speech can present challenges, but we generally don\u2019t view foreign accents\
    \ as a problem. We can choose to work on them if we want, or embrace our accents\
    \ as part of our identity. However, discussing speech recognition for disordered\
    \ speech is very similar to recognizing atypical speech, including child speech,\
    \ foreign speech, and idiosyncratic pronunciations. Dialects and variations also\
    \ fall under this category."
  sec: 1523
  time: '25:23'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: For example, the Scottish accent.
  sec: 1582
  time: '26:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Some languages have rich regional varieties, and others do not. In the case
    of Scottish, a local variant can differ significantly from the so-called standard.
  sec: 1586
  time: '26:26'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: I remember watching a video from the British Parliament where a representative
    from Scotland spoke, and nobody could understand him. They asked him to repeat
    himself several times. It was quite amusing!
  sec: 1606
  time: '26:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: "In such cases, it\u2019s often best to use the standard version for effective\
    \ communication, but that\u2019s not always possible. Sometimes, not conveying\
    \ everything can have its advantages."
  sec: 1626
  time: '27:06'
  who: Katarzyna
- header: Overview of speech recognition technology
- line: "Can we talk about speech recognition? How does it work in general? Before\
    \ diving into the differences between typical and atypical speech recognition,\
    \ what\u2019s the proper term to use for standard speech?"
  sec: 1651
  time: '27:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That\u2019s a very timely topic, as there\u2019s so much change happening\
    \ in this area. We have large language models with generative AI. Traditionally,\
    \ models were trained on precise datasets, typically collected according to a\
    \ prepared scenario. A good example of standard speech is data collected from\
    \ speakers like those from the BBC."
  sec: 1674
  time: '27:54'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: So if we consider British English, that would be a standard reference, right?
  sec: 1715
  time: '28:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, usually these datasets are designed to reflect standard speech. The\
    \ systems are trained to map the output of spoken language to the model phrases\
    \ they were trained on. However, with the advent of large language models, we\
    \ can incorporate contextual training, which improves recognition. There\u2019\
    s hope for better recognition of atypical speech as well."
  sec: 1715
  time: '28:35'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "Right. It\u2019s important to distinguish between standard and atypical speech."
  sec: 1734
  time: '28:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, and it\u2019s essential to recognize that we all speak atypically at\
    \ times. Factors like speaking fast or slow can affect clarity. Automatic speech\
    \ recognition systems are typically trained on data from speakers without speech\
    \ disorders. Therefore, they can struggle to recognize atypical patterns, which\
    \ leads to poor accuracy."
  sec: 1742
  time: '29:02'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: So if I understand correctly, ASR (automatic speech recognition) systems struggle
    with speech that deviates from what they were trained on.
  sec: 1812
  time: '30:12'
  who: Alexey
- header: Challenges of ASR systems with atypical speech
- line: Absolutely. This misalignment between training and real-world usage can lead
    to significant recognition challenges.
  sec: 1824
  time: '30:24'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: So what can be done about this?
  sec: 1833
  time: '30:33'
  who: Alexey
- header: Strategies for improving recognition of disordered speech
- line: There are several strategies we can implement. One approach is to collect
    and curate specialized datasets that include speech from individuals with various
    disorders, using this as a subset in training. We can also employ transfer learning
    techniques to adapt models that were trained on standard data for individuals
    with speech disorders.
  sec: 1853
  time: '30:53'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "What if we don\u2019t have such data available?"
  sec: 2222
  time: '37:02'
  who: Alexey
- header: Data augmentation for training models
- line: If data collection is challenging, we can utilize data augmentation to expand
    the training dataset by artificially simulating disordered speech. For example,
    if we know specific sounds or consonant clusters are problematic, we can create
    artificial variations.
  sec: 2227
  time: '37:07'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "That\u2019s interesting."
  sec: 2251
  time: '37:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Another strategy is using multimodal outputs. While we learn from audio,\
    \ adding visual data\u2014such as lip reading or gesture recognition\u2014"
  sec: 2253
  time: '37:33'
  who: Katarzyna
- header: Transfer learning in speech recognition
- line: "Yeah, not yet, of course. But I've worked with images, and in a typical situation,\
    \ you have an ImageNet neural network trained on ImageNet. Then you have your\
    \ own data, which could be tractors or anything else not included in ImageNet.\
    \ You might find tractors there, but also something else. You take, say, 1,000\
    \ examples and fine-tune your network that was trained previously on ImageNet.\
    \ The same process applies to speech. There is a model trained on standard data,\
    \ and then you collect disordered speech. It doesn\u2019t have to be a very large\
    \ sample, like with images, and you apply transfer learning to fine-tune your\
    \ model, right?"
  sec: 2417
  time: '40:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: "You mentioned data collection, and I said it\u2019s not always easy because\
    \ of the variety of speech disorders. For people with motor speech disorders,\
    \ it can be challenging to organize the entire collection process. Also, considering\
    \ we\u2019re dealing with health issues, GDPR regulations come into play. It would\
    \ be ideal for research purposes to have large corpora of disordered speech."
  sec: 2470
  time: '41:10'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "In terms of transfer learning, we don\u2019t need a lot of data. A few hundred\
    \ examples are usually sufficient to get started, at least with images."
  sec: 2515
  time: '41:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Indeed. However, when we consider different disorders, languages, and non-English
    languages, the volume of data needed becomes substantial.
  sec: 2529
  time: '42:09'
  who: Katarzyna
- header: Challenges of collecting data for various speech disorders
- line: "You need to account for each subset. For instance, stammering is a relatively\
    \ common disorder. It might not be too difficult to gather data from American\
    \ English speakers who stammer. But if we look at a particular dialect or a less\
    \ common language\u2014"
  sec: 2538
  time: '42:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, take a language that isn't widely spoken.
  sec: 2567
  time: '42:47'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: That's a good example. An interesting case is bilingual individuals, as studies
    show stammering can occur in one language and not in another. This is linked to
    specific semantic clusters or syllables that may be more common in one language
    than in another.
  sec: 2568
  time: '42:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are significant differences in these cases.
  sec: 2611
  time: '43:31'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "Exactly. I sometimes experience this myself. Maybe it\u2019s because I'm\
    \ thinking about what to say next, and then I start stammering. It doesn\u2019\
    t happen often, but I\u2019ve noticed it happening to others, too."
  sec: 2633
  time: '43:53'
  who: Alexey
- header: Stammering and its connection to fluency issues
- line: Fluency issues are normal human behaviors, but stammering should be diagnosed
    as it differs from what most of us experience. Fluency is more common when using
    a foreign language; we often need time to find the right words.
  sec: 2671
  time: '44:31'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: With stammering, individuals know what they want to say, but they struggle
    with certain sequences of sounds.
  sec: 2683
  time: '44:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, it can block speech at the beginning of a sentence, while the rest flows\
    \ fine. Sometimes, it\u2019s linked to specific consonant clusters that are tough\
    \ to pronounce. If a language has many of these, like English or Polish, it can\
    \ be challenging."
  sec: 2688
  time: '44:48'
  who: Katarzyna
- header: Polish consonant combinations and pronunciation challenges
- line: "Polish does have many challenging consonant combinations. I recall a funny\
    \ story from Krakow about a central street called \"Czarnowiejska.\" It's packed\
    \ with consonants, and it\u2019s always amusing to see a British person trying\
    \ to pronounce it."
  sec: 2716
  time: '45:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly! There\u2019s a trick with certain sounds, where two consonants together\
    \ create one sound. This can make pronunciation tricky."

- header: Use of Amazon Transcribe for generating podcast transcripts
- line: By the way, I use automatic speech recognition for podcast episodes after
    recording. I utilize Amazon Transcribe, which is supposed to recognize English.
  sec: 2777
  time: '46:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: "So, you\u2019re using that for generating transcripts?"
  sec: 2792
  time: '46:32'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: "Yes, but it expects English. Then, all of a sudden, I might throw in a Polish\
    \ word, like \"sensu.\" I think it\u2019s interesting how LMs are being used more\
    \ frequently in this area. I do this as well. After getting the output from Amazon\
    \ Transcribe, I feed that into an LM or an LLM. Even if the transcriber misses\
    \ something, the LLM, using the surrounding context, can often correct it."
  sec: 2794
  time: '46:34'
  who: Alexey
- header: Role of language models in speech recognition
- line: Absolutely. LMs can assist at various levels. Adding context is crucial for
    recognition and transcription. We should focus more on meaning preservation rather
    than traditional metrics like word error rate or accuracy.
  sec: 2848
  time: '47:28'
  who: Katarzyna
- header: Contextual understanding in speech recognition
- line: That makes sense. In my case, I had an interview about Scikit-learn. Many
    in the machine learning community know it, but the speech recognition system struggled
    to identify it correctly, especially since I was speaking with a French accent.
    However, because we provided context in our discussion, the LLM was able to infer
    the correct term.
  sec: 2959
  time: '49:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That's a fantastic example! This two-step process\u2014first speech recognition\
    \ and then using an LM\u2014works well. There are also models that can integrate\
    \ both steps into one."

- line: "I suppose it\u2019s about understanding how voice recognition systems operate.\
    \ They analyze utterances, right?"
  sec: 3087
  time: '51:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: It can be anything; it can be a word, it can be a phrase. A phoneme is what...
  sec: 3104
  time: '51:44'
  who: Katarzyna
- line: One sound, but like a word that I say, an utterance, right? For example, I
    have a disorder; I say "whiskey" instead of "whiskey." If I have a language model
    in my voice recognition system, it can understand from the context that I'm not
    talking about the alcoholic beverage, but rather about something that carries
    a lot of risk. Because it has access to the other words, the goal of a language
    model is to predict the next word based on the context. We can utilize language
    models, and we probably do, in voice recognition systems, right?
  sec: 3110
  time: '51:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It can be trained to predict it or, in post-processing, it can say, \"Okay,\
    \ it\u2019s strange that it\u2019s in this context; it should be something else.\"\
    \ All predictions we make are what happens next, as LLMs do. It can indicate that\
    \ \"risky\" should come instead of the beverage from your example. So, it can\
    \ be done before and also at the second step. One thing that came to my mind now,\
    \ if we still have time, is that ASR models can also be personalized for specific\
    \ individuals with specific disorders. In this case, this first stage, the training,\
    \ and preparing the model to expect atypical productions or articulations can\
    \ be done. It\u2019s a bit different if we want to have a model that recognizes\
    \ both standard speech and atypical productions."

    as a user. It asks me, "Hey, can you pronounce this sentence?" I record myself
    saying the sentence, and then it asks me to pronounce something else. I do this
    for about ten sentences, and then it builds a model tailored specifically to the
    way I speak.
