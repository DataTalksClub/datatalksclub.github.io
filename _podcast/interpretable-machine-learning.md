description: 'Discover interpretable machine learning: learn SHAP, Conformal Prediction,
  calibrated uncertainty and model trust to debug models and boost reliability.'
intro: How can you reliably trust a machine learning model’s predictions in real-world
  settings? In this episode Christoph Molnar — statistician, machine learner, and
  author of Interpretable Machine Learning — walks through practical approaches for
  building model trust. Drawing on his experience from Kaggle competitions to authoring
  a technical book, Christoph explains the trade-offs between interpretability and
  accuracy and shows how interpretability techniques help debug models. <br><br> Key
  topics include a SHAP deep dive with practical Python examples for attributing predictions,
  conformal prediction for calibrated uncertainty and creating prediction sets, and
  the difference between explainable AI and interpretable machine learning. He also
  discusses using interpretability to debug models, maintain hands-on skills through
  competitions, and document experiments for reproducible insights. <br><br> If you
  want concrete tools to evaluate model trust—how to quantify uncertainty, interpret
  feature effects with SHAP, and produce reliable prediction sets with conformal methods—this
  episode offers clear, actionable guidance and directions for further reading. Ideal
  for data scientists and ML practitioners focused on interpretable machine learning,
  model debugging, and trustworthy AI.

- header: Podcast Introduction
- header: 'Guest Intro: Christoph Molnar, Interpretable ML Author'
- line: This week, we'll talk about making machine learning interpretable. We have
    a very special guest today, Christoph. Christoph has a PhD in interpretable machine
    learning from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He worked for a while
    in both academia and industry and now, he is a full-time tech writer. He has written
    many technical books. If you're watching this video, there is a bookshelf behind
    Christoph. Yeah, with all these four books at the top – we'll probably talk about
    some of them today. It's a great pleasure to have you, Christoph. Welcome to the
    show.
  sec: 42
  time: 0:42
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, thank you for the invitation.
  sec: 83
  time: '1:23'
  who: Christoph
- line: The questions for today, as always, were by Johannah Bayer. Thanks, Johannah,
    for your help.
  sec: 85
  time: '1:25'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Career Journey: From Statistics to Tech Writing'
- line: Before we start with our main topic, let's talk about your background. Can
    you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 92
  time: '1:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. My background is in different phases. Phase one was the classic statistician
    education, I would say – a Bachelor’s in statistics, Master’s and statistics –
    very classic, hypothesis testing and stuff like this. In the end, I was already
    a bit drawn to machine learning – I did Kaggle competitions and stuff. Right after
    I finished my Master’s, I went to industry.
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Christoph
- line: I did one year at a fintech startup, where I worked as a data scientist, then
    two years as a more classic statistician, where I worked in medical research.
    During that time, I already started writing the book Interpretable Machine Learning,
    because I had a part-time position. I just had different side projects and one
    of them was the book. That's a bit ironic, because after my Master's thesis, (I
    really hated my master's thesis –  the writing process. So it's quite ironic that
    I picked up writing again. And as I was
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Christoph
- line: It’s a different kind of writing, right?
  sec: 164
  time: '2:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's very different, yeah. I think that was the reason why it worked for me.
    When I was writing the book, it kind of took the fear out of writing again for
    me, because the main reason I also didn't do a PhD was, “Oh, I have to write papers.
    I hate writing. I hated my Master thesis, so I should not do a PhD.” But when
    I started the book, I realized I could… [cross-talk]
  sec: 165
  time: '2:45'
  who: Christoph
- line: So you had a fear of writing, yet you thought, “Okay… Let's write a book.
    Let's see how it goes.”
  sec: 189
  time: '3:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, because… I don't know. For the Master's thesis, I was very stressed
    out. It was not only about writing… Maybe it wasn't fear of writing, but I hated
    the process. All
  sec: 195
  time: '3:15'
  who: Christoph
- line: Experiments – all that, right? And then getting feedback from your… At least
    this was how it was for me. Doing all these experiments, showing it to my supervisor,
    and then he would say, “Hmm… Something doesn't seem right. Maybe you need another
    half a year.” Right?
  sec: 208
  time: '3:28'
  who: Alexey
- header: Becoming a Full-Time Technical Writer
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah. And I also didn''t feel so free when writing the Master''s
    thesis. But when I started the book, I wrote it in the open, got feedback, and
    could just write how I felt. I [could] put in some jokes and not hide behind math
    or anything, just say, “Okay, this is like this.” I use analogies and stuff like
    that. So I enjoyed this part very much, which then led me to do a PhD. So [I went]
    back to academia. Then I, again, learned to hate writing. [chuckles] So I really
    hated writing papers. But still, I finished my PhD. This was one year ago. Then
    I actually tried a postdoc job for a few months and another job in industry for
    a few months, and it didn''t feel right, kind of. I quit both very quickly.'
  sec: 225
  time: '3:45'
  who: Christoph
- line: Then I thought back, “Okay, what's left? What can I do?” Because I now have
    quit all these things. So I looked back and the only constant thing was writing
    for me, which I always enjoyed. Then I decided, “Yeah, why not do this full time?”
    I already had my first book, so I had a little bit of income from that book and
    already a somewhat established reader base and some experience. So I jumped into
    this, and I've been doing this now for a year and a half and yeah – it has worked
    out so far. [chuckles]
  sec: 225
  time: '3:45'
  who: Christoph
- line: Well, I know that Munich is not the cheapest city. So apparently, it's working
    out pretty well for you, right?
  sec: 316
  time: '5:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, I'm earning less than I did in my PhD. Usually people tend to climb
    up in their career in terms of how much they earn. For me, each career step was
    a little less money, [chuckles] which is a bit funny, but I have so much freedom
    that I don't regret it. But when I started, my first job was in Switzerland. My
    second job was a part-time job so it was a little bit less. Then back to Munich,
    a little bit less. [chuckles] And now, with my writing, again, a little bit less
    than a PhD. But I think a full-time PhD is not… I mean, it could earn more, of
    course, now if I would go for a regular data scientist role. But I enjoy the freedom
    a lot that I have now as a writer.
  sec: 323
  time: '5:23'
  who: Christoph
- line: So You can just go to one of the lakes in the Alps. [Christoph chuckles and
    agrees]. Well, maybe it's a bit cold for that now. But still, you could do this
    if you wanted. Right?
  sec: 369
  time: '6:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. And I can do sports in the middle of the day or start cooking earlier
    – I love cooking, for example. But still, I think sometimes about writing and
    so make progress there at the same time.
  sec: 382
  time: '6:22'
  who: Christoph
- header: 'Kaggle Beginnings: Linear Models to Practical ML'
- line: Do you remember what your first Kaggle competition was?
  sec: 397
  time: '6:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first one? This was during my Master’s, and I didn't yet know much machine
    learning. My first models were a linear regression model and a generalized additive
    model. I think it was something with diabetes, but I’m not sure entirely what
    the topic was. But I remembered that I was really, really bad at the competition.
    [laughs] And this was also like this for me. Because in theory, I mean, I knew
    how to model data, how to build a prediction model – but just from a statistician
    point of view, not from a machine learning point of view. My first thoughts were
    something like, “Okay, this should be a generalized additive model with these
    features.” I didn't even have a validation set up on my side and haven't fully
    understood…
  sec: 400
  time: '6:40'
  who: Christoph
- line: This is not what you do in statistics, right? [Christoph agrees] I remember
    my first Kaggle competition – I did super bad. Because I thought that with all
    this knowledge I had from my courses, I would just ace it. The reality was the
    complete opposite. Very interesting.
  sec: 450
  time: '7:30'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Origin Story: Interest in Interpretable Machine Learning'
- line: How did you become interested in interpretable machine learning? Is it something
    you were doing during your Master’s? Or is it something you needed to do at your
    work (in that tech startup)? What led you to it?
  sec: 470
  time: '7:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it was quite natural, I think. Because as a statistician, you always
    think about the data generating process. And when you build modelы, they're usually
    interpretable. Еhis is the mindset I came from, “Okay, let's understand the data.
    Let's build an understandable model.” And when I transitioned more into machine
    learning, this was kind of lost – not fully, because there were things like random
    forests, which would have this built-in feature importance and stuff like this.
    But it felt like, “Okay, there are parts missing.” Then, during my second job
    in Switzerland, I had these side projects and during one day off, I read a line
    paper, which is about an interpretability method that fits linear models to explain
    individual predictions of more complex models.
  sec: 483
  time: '8:03'
  who: Christoph
- line: This was quite fascinating to me, like, “Oh, well, we could have a really
    complex model and then I'll still have a chance to understand what's going on
    inside the model.” I wanted to learn more, but I couldn't learn more because there
    was not that much material online. That was my motivation to write a book about
    this topic. I was quite lucky with the timing as well, because there was nothing
    on the market yet [about that].
  sec: 483
  time: '8:03'
  who: Christoph
- header: 'Interpretability vs Accuracy: Debugging Models with SHAP'
- line: Speaking of Kaggle – in Kaggle, they don't really care about the explainability/interpretability.
    All they care about is predictions. Right? You care about all these predictions
    and it doesn't matter how exactly the model is making these predictions. Sometimes
    it works. At work, you also have similar situations – like churn/not churn. Maybe
    if it's a lot of users, you don't really go and dig deeper into each individual
    user when you want to understand why a particular decision happened.
  sec: 567
  time: '9:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: As long as the business metrics are satisfied, everyone is happy, then you
    just stack more layers – or, I don't know, do something. You don't necessarily
    go and try to figure out why the model was wrong for this particular customer.
    I imagine there are many, many cases, especially in medical research, where you
    do have to care about this.
  sec: 567
  time: '9:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think I don't fully agree with the Kaggle case because in Kaggle, of course,
    what gets you the money is to be right with your predictions. I think interpretability
    can help you even with Kaggle (go to the back a little). A really stupid example,
    but I'm doing a competition at the moment. When I created the futures, I kind
    of had a target leakage because a version of my target, I put into my features.
    But I also had interpretability at the end of the model, to look at the feature
    importance using SHAP and immediately… So first of all, I saw the prediction error
    go down by a lot.
  sec: 628
  time: '10:28'
  who: Christoph
- line: I was super happy. But then a little voice in my head said, “This is not true.
    Don't be happy. There's something wrong with your model.” And it turned out to
    be wrong. I super quickly found the bug. For the feature importance ranking, this
    one feature bubbled to the top. Now, you won’t need feature importance for this,
    of course, because you could check your column names, for example. But if you
    have a large feature set, then it's quite tedious to look through all of them.
    For these interpretation methods, if you have a similar mistake, like target leakage
    it just bubbles the most important feature to the top. So I would say interpretability
    is useful for debugging your model.
  sec: 628
  time: '10:28'
  who: Christoph
- header: 'Active Competition: River Flow Forecasting Project'
- line: So you still take part in competitions?
  sec: 719
  time: '11:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's been some time, yeah. It's my first competition in many years. It's not
    on Kaggle. It's on… What is it called? Data-driven, I think. It's for forecasting
    water volume through rivers.
  sec: 722
  time: '12:02'
  who: Christoph
- line: Yes. Speaking of flexibility. We have a… I don’t know if I can say “job,”
    but with this type of activity, you have the freedom of doing other things, like
    taking part in competitions. Okay. So you realized that this is an important topic,
    there wasn’t much literature or information available about that, and you thought,
    “Hmm… I don't like writing, but maybe I should try doing it one more time.” Right?
  sec: 742
  time: '12:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I just started to… I don't know my thought process. I was just like,
    “Wow, this would be a cool opportunity.” At this point, my Master thesis was…
    I think two years behind me – maybe I just forgot how it felt. [chuckles] But
    also, it was kind of stress-free, because I could just write – it was a side project
    for me, so no stakes involved at this point. I had no pressure of having to do
    the writing so well that I get a Master's degree or get a paper published or anything.
    I could just write how I felt it to be the best way. So this kind of brought the
    fun back to me for writing stuff, because I really enjoy understanding difficult
    things and writing them down in a simpler way. Writing is one way you can express
    this.
  sec: 777
  time: '12:57'
  who: Christoph
- header: 'Choosing Book Topics: Audience Data and Personal Curiosity'
- line: So the best way to learn something is to teach something, or at least write
    about this. Right?
  sec: 837
  time: '13:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's a bit like this. It's also a problem because sometimes, when I
    write my newsletter, or when I pick a new book – when I already know the topic,
    I feel like there's not that much value in it, which is obviously wrong because,
    at some point, I didn't know these things. At this point in the past, I would
    have loved to read about them. But for me, it feels like if it's too easy to write
    about, it's not worth writing about it. This is obviously wrong because if enough
    other people see value from your writing, then your writing is valuable. So I
    kind of mix these up…
  sec: 841
  time: '14:01'
  who: Christoph
- line: '[cross-talk] … if it’s an easy text. Because machine learning is a complex
    thing and if there is some resource that explains complex things with simple language,
    then it''s good. Right?'
  sec: 879
  time: '14:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's good. But sometimes I feel like “I already understand this. I shouldn’t
    write about it.” But sometimes that's maybe the most valuable thing to write about.
    Because I already have understood it, and maybe it was hard for me to understand
    it, but if I want to write about something new, I always feel like I also have
    to learn it right now. But also, one of the reasons why I became a writer was
    so that I could always learn new things. It's kind of like a dance between these
    two things – it should be simple, so I can spend not too much time on one thing,
    but also, I want to write about something that's exciting for me as well.
  sec: 893
  time: '14:53'
  who: Christoph
- line: Why a book? Usually the story I hear from authors (and I also published) is…
    For me, I first wrote an article, then a bunch of articles, and then I thought,
    “Okay, maybe I should do something bigger.” But you just jumped into writing a
    book without really liking to write.
  sec: 933
  time: '15:33'
  who: Alexey
- header: 'Publishing in Public: Chapter-by-Chapter Workflow'
- line: Yeah, good question. For me, I already did some blogging before, but I always
    quit after a few months. But I already had a little bit of experience with writing
    more freely. With the book, it wasn't like, “Hide in my room for two years, and
    then finish the book and publish it.” I published it as a website – Interpretable
    Machine Learning is still available for free. I published it chapter by chapter.
    So it kind of felt like blogging but, of course, it was one unit. However, [this
    approach] allowed me to get feedback very early on, and to write chapter by chapter.
    It didn't feel like one huge chunk – like a huge mountain to climb – but little
    steps. I think if I hadn't gotten any feedback in the beginning, (I shared it
    on Twitter, for example) I’m not sure if I would have finished the book, or it
    would have just been like half a book or a much shorter book.
  sec: 955
  time: '15:55'
  who: Christoph
- header: 'Self-Publishing vs Publishers: Control, Editors, Royalties'
- line: But also, as we spoke briefly at the beginning, you don't have a publisher
    – you published on your own, right? [Christoph agrees] This requires a lot of
    self-discipline. If you don't publish a chapter, in the case with a publisher,
    the publisher will chase you saying, “Hey, where's another chapter? The due date
    was half a year ago. So something.” But here, if you're late, you have to chase
    yourself. So you have to have discipline for that. [Christoph agrees] How do you
    do that? Is there a secret, or do you just like the topic and writing so much?
  sec: 1027
  time: '17:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say that I'm inherently motivated to do the writing. But sometimes,
    to force myself to bring everything together, I sometimes use deadlines for myself,
    as well. Sometimes you just feel like, “Okay, you could write more, or maybe add
    another chapter.” But sometimes you just have to finish, and a deadline is then
    important. I actually was approached by publishers – typical technical publishers
    – and they asked me, “Hey, do you want to publish Interpretable Machine Learning
    with us or maybe also write a new book on topic XYZ?” And I always research them,
    how they work, and so on. Then I read about it, and I was like, “No, that's not
    my style. I don't want to have their strict schedule.” I also heard that sometimes
    the editors they have are not so good. Then, also, I get a much smaller share
    of the royalties. And I was like, “No, I'll do this myself.”

    tell us what these books are?
  sec: 1138
  time: '18:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: So, I've written four books. One of them is Interpretable Machine Learning,
    which is my first book. There's also a second edition already. This was already
    finished during my PhD, and it's about different… Basically, each chapter has
    one method that allows you to interpret your machine learning model. My second
    book, which was when I already started doing this full time, is Modeling Mindsets.
    It's a very small book. It's also quite different from the first one. It's about
    the different ways to think about modeling your data.
  sec: 1144
  time: '19:04'
  who: Christoph
- line: I already mentioned how I, as a statistician, participated in the Kaggle challenge
    and quickly realized, “Okay, I won't get far with the way I approach modeling.”
    So things like these inspired me to write this book. My third book is quite different
    – it's about conformal prediction, which is a method to quantify uncertainty of
    your models. It's an introduction to this topic. This was purely because I wanted
    to learn about the topic and so I wrote the book – it’s like an introduction book.
    This was a very classic case of learning by teaching.
  sec: 1144
  time: '19:04'
  who: Christoph
- line: What’s the name of the book again?
  sec: 1217
  time: '20:17'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 1219
  time: '20:19'
  who: Christoph
- line: Confounded…?
  sec: 1223
  time: '20:23'

  sec: 1225
  time: '20:25'

- header: 'Conformal Prediction: Calibrated Uncertainty and Prediction Sets'
- line: Conformal. [Christoph confirms] I don't think I ever heard this term. What
    does it actually mean?
  sec: 1227
  time: '20:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Conformal prediction is about… The basic idea is that you have some kind of
    uncertainty, and your model and conformal prediction is a kind of process – there
    are many different algorithms – and they conformalize this uncertainty measure
    so that you can trust your output. For example, you could have a classifier that
    outputs class probabilities and you could use conformal prediction to say that,
    instead of outputting one class or just the probabilities, you get a set with
    some guarantees (that's important part, these guarantees) of probability that
    has like a 95% chance that there are correct classes within these sets. You can
    also use conformal prediction for quantile regression, for example, so that the
    quanta really contain 80% of your data, of your predictions, of the actual outcome.
  sec: 1235
  time: '20:35'
  who: Christoph
- line: We spoke about this example of churn prediction. So here, instead of just
    saying, “This John Doe will churn with a probability of 80%,” it would have a
    range (an interval) of how certain we are that this prediction is correct.
  sec: 1298
  time: '21:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's also one method. Conformal prediction is kind of… For classification,
    we can kind of put a balance on the probabilities. You don't just give one probability
    but a range between what you believe… [cross-talk]
  sec: 1315
  time: '21:55'
  who: Christoph
- line: Is it related to… I guess there is some relationship between interpretable
    AI and this topic. Because to come up with this balance, you kind of need to do
    similar things, right? Or am I completely wrong?
  sec: 1338
  time: '22:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: So, technically, I will say it's different. Because for conformal prediction,
    you separate your model… So, let's begin with the similarities. It's a bit similar
    to these model-agnostic interpretability techniques, in so far that you can first
    train your model (any model, really – it could be random forest, it could be neural
    network) and then apply the method afterwards. Because, at least for some classes
    of conformal prediction, which are called inductive conformal prediction, these
    can apply to your model after you've trained it. The idea is that you have a calibration
    step so you can use some output from a model which quantifies the uncertainty
    and kind of calibrates it the right way. But otherwise, yeah, that's the idea…
    [cross-talk]
  sec: 1353
  time: '22:33'
  who: Christoph
- line: The methods are completely different, right? Only the way you can apply it.
    There is a model running in production, so you don't need to actually do anything
    with that model – you just do something on top.
  sec: 1406
  time: '23:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that’s at least one possibility with inductive confirmed prediction.
    Yeah.

- header: 'SHAP Deep Dive: Practical Guide and Python Examples'
- line: Interesting. And the fourth book?
  sec: 1424
  time: '23:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's Interpreting Machine Learning Models with SHAP . It also has
    Python examples, which my first book doesn't have, about interpretable machine
    learning. But otherwise, it's kind of taking one of the chapters from Interpret
    Machine Learning and doing a deep dive into one of the methods, which I think
    is also the most popular method (SHAP) and also one of the most versatile methods.
    So I decided it would be cool to have a book on it. This was one of the books
    where I was like, “Okay, I really have a lot of material already – and I still
    learned a ton while writing the book, because you realize that you still have
    many gaps – but still, this was where I kind of took the stuff that I already
    had and not only learned new things. [chuckles]
  sec: 1429
  time: '23:49'
  who: Christoph
- line: How did you decide that you want to write about this particular method? Did
    you do some research that showed that this is the most popular one? Did your readers
    maybe ask you for more examples for more hands-on examples with code? What was
    your process? How did you arrive at the idea that you want to write this particular
    book?
  sec: 1481
  time: '24:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. For SHAP, I already had some insights as it is hugely popular. So it
    was kind of market research because I already know from my book, Interpretable
    Machine Learning, from Google Analytics, I know which chapters are popular. SHAP…
    I also have a separate SHapley values chapter and they kind of belong together.
    They are by far the most popular ones. So this was…
  sec: 1503
  time: '25:03'
  who: Christoph
- line: Thay had the most visits, right? Because you can see how many times each chapter
    was viewed, right?
  sec: 1530
  time: '25:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Also, I think SHAP is not super intuitive. I mean, it has lots of material
    already, like blog posts, and so on. But I thought that putting this all together
    in a book would be valuable to many readers. I also find SHAP interesting because
    there's always this danger – you shouldn't always only rely on one interpretation
    method. There was already a blog post about it – SHAP is not all you need. But
    if someone would force you to use only one, I would use SHAP, because it's very
    versatile. I think there's a lot of value if you learn it.
  sec: 1537
  time: '25:37'
  who: Christoph
- header: 'Terminology: Explainable AI vs Interpretable Machine Learning'
- line: Well, maybe we need to speak about this particular method. But I see that
    there are quite interesting questions. The first question is from Rosana. The
    question is, “Is there any difference between Explainable AI and Interpretable
    AI?”
  sec: 1577
  time: '26:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Many, many people ask this. I don't think I have a satisfying answer. Some
    days ago, I posted about an overview of how researchers use this differently.
    How I use these terms is – I use both interpretable machine learning and explainable
    AI as keywords. I think that's most useful because there's so much overlap. But
    people just use both quite interchangeably. So if you want to do a Google search
    on some topic, I would always use both. I think I make a distinction when I use
    words – when I say, “I want to explain a prediction.” Some people would criticize
    me now, “You don't explain a prediction,” because it's a very strong word, obviously.
    But I think it's still fair to use it.
  sec: 1591
  time: '26:31'
  who: Christoph
- line: So this would be more for a local understanding of the model. And for global
    understanding, I use the word “interpreting” more. I know that others like to
    distinguish between interpretable models – with this, I mean that they are kind
    of inherently interpretable, like a linear regression model – and explainable
    AI like for these postdoc things. But I don’t think that's a good distinction,
    because the boundaries between the two are not super clear. So I'm sorry, but
    I don't think I have a very satisfying clean answer.
  sec: 1591
  time: '26:31'
  who: Christoph
- line: So not really much difference. The question was about explainable AI and interpretable
    AI – but you corrected it to “interpretable machine learning,” right?
  sec: 1688
  time: '28:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: To cover both, yeah. Interpretable AI, explainable…
  sec: 1699
  time: '28:19'
  who: Christoph
- line: Is that how they are usually used? Is this how the term is? It’s always “interpretable
    ML”?
  sec: 1699
  time: '28:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm biased because I named my book this way. So, in my head, it’s always “interpretable
    ML”, and not “AI”. But you can also use this. I guess the question boils down
    to the definition between interpretable and explainable – I don't make a big distinction
    between the two.
  sec: 1709
  time: '28:29'
  who: Christoph
- line: Well, if you think about the words themselves – what's the difference between
    “explain” and “interpret”? For “interpret,” you interpret it, and you don't necessarily
    explain it to others. [chuckles]
  sec: 1730
  time: '28:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. for me…
  sec: 1740
  time: '29:00'
  who: Christoph
- line: Like “I understand how it works.”
  sec: 1742
  time: '29:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: …”explainable,” for me, is a very strong word. I think that was also why I
    said interpretable machine learning when I named my book. But I named it quite
    early on, so a lot of things happened afterwards and the term “Explainable AI”
    got quite famous as well. At some point, it actually was named Explainable AI
    (my book) but then I decided against it, and now it's Interpretable Machine Learning”.
    I think I like “interpretability” a little bit more, because “explainability”
    is very strong. To explain something, you have deeply understood it. But interpretation
    is like, “Okay, you see something and you have an interpretation, because you
    don't fully understand it, but just parts.” You kind of derive with your insights,
    which is an interpretation of what you see. So that's why I like the term more

  sec: 1800
  time: '30:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sometimes, yes. I like working by myself a lot. But sometimes I'm like, “It
    would be nice to work in a team for a day or so.” The problem is, you can’t really
    do this on and off. I mean, you can, but then you're tied to a work project and…
    I just would like to have this some day. I mean, it's not fully lonely. I'm talking
    to you right now, for example. You can do other things like podcasts and talk
    to people.
  sec: 1819
  time: '30:19'
  who: Christoph

    colleague of mine. We’re writing this book together – it's my first collaborative
    book. I also have a little team right now, at least for this one project. So it's
    not only me sitting alone in my room and tinkering and writing. [chuckles]
  sec: 1819
  time: '30:19'
  who: Christoph
- line: I guess writing with somebody else not only makes the process… It kind of
    forces you to finish earlier, because half of the content is written by you and
    half of the content is written by your co-author, and then you review each other.
    So, you kind of deliver the book faster, right?
  sec: 1878
  time: '31:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say it's slower because my co-author has a full-time job. Like to.
    He’s a postdoc, so he can’t dedicate as much time as I can. So if I would write
    it alone, I think it would be faster. But it's fine the way it is. The topic is
    supervised machine learning and science. It's about how supervised machine learning
    is used, like for doing research and stuff – so, kind of, applied machine learning.
    The book has two parts. It's about  the justification of why it's okay to do it,
    or whether it's okay to use machine learning because there's some problems, of
    course, when you don't fully understand the model and so on.
  sec: 1901
  time: '31:41'
  who: Christoph
- line: But also there are puzzle pieces that if you use machine learning in science
    or in research, what do you actually need to make it work? Because if you just
    use it in something like a Kaggle competition, then there's lots of missing pieces,
    like causality, interpretability, uncertainty, quantification, etc. So we're kind
    of putting this together and I think it's good that we’re taking the time to write
    this. We have a half draft now. But we're taking our time to really think this
    through, because it's a new topic and there’s also a philosophical component to
    it. I think it's a fun project.
  sec: 1901
  time: '31:41'
  who: Christoph
- header: 'Staying Hands-On: Competitions to Maintain Practical Skills'
- line: So you said you would write it faster because your co-author has other commitments.
    Then you also don't invest as much time as you could potentially because you probably…
    What I'm trying to say is that you probably still have time [left over]. So are
    you working on something else in the meantime apart from the book?
  sec: 1987
  time: '33:07'

    platform.

  sec: 2014
  time: '33:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's almost full-time at the moment, since a week or so. But that's
    the first time I'm doing this since I've been writing. I felt like I need a hands-on
    project again because sometimes it can feel like a disconnect, if you always write
    about using machine learning and so on. I do have lots of experience from earlier
    on. But the last one and a half years, I've only been writing and doing no data
    analysis, really. Then it feels like I’m a bit out of touch maybe. So it was really
    good to do. It still feels really good to do a hands-on project with all the problems
    with the data and how to model it and so on.
  sec: 2018
  time: '33:38'
  who: Christoph
- line: It's nice that you brought this up, because I also… I used to work as a data
    scientist full-time and now I don't. What I'm afraid of is that I'll lose touch
    with reality. Because if somebody asks me about something, then my answer would
    be based on my experience that I got at work – but I'm no longer working, so this
    answer might be outdated. The longer I don't work as a data scientist, the more
    outdated my answers become, right? [Christoph agrees]
  sec: 2060
  time: '34:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: So how do I stay hands-on? This is what you’re doing, right? You’re taking
    part in competitions and you make sure that the methods you teach (the things
    you write about) are still applicable because you can apply them in these real
    life projects.
  sec: 2060
  time: '34:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. But I feel like… I didn't expect this, but the writing helps me to be
    better in the competition. It's because I'm now much more structured. I actually
    have a little logbook where I write about when I'm stuck, for example, or when
    I have a breakthrough. I didn't expect this, but it helps me a lot to keep my
    thoughts in order because in a machine learning competition, you have so many
    directions that you could follow. Very often, you try something and it doesn't
    work.
  sec: 2113
  time: '35:13'
  who: Christoph
- line: I still get frustrated when it happens, especially if you invest a whole day.
    But if you can write it down, you can process it, I think, much faster and be
    like, “Yeah, this was an experiment. The experiment showed, for example, this
    weather data didn't help anything with the prediction or improving the performance.
    So I’ll move on to the next experiment.” To keep myself focused on what I'm doing,
    it helps me so much that I have this habit of writing. It’s quite unexpected.

  sec: 2191
  time: '36:31'
  who: Christoph

    a competition and I want to follow your approach. I want to have this logbook.
    How should I do that?
  sec: 2193
  time: '36:33'
  who: Alexey

    but it's not like I have a fully-fleshed out process on how I do this.
  sec: 2203
  time: '36:43'
  who: Christoph

    you can publish, right?
  sec: 2212
  time: '36:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I actually thought about that. Because there's communication, there's
    prize money involved in this project (in this competition). Mostly, of course,
    it’s performance-based, but there's also a competition part or a prize part about
    explainability and communication.
  sec: 2215
  time: '36:55'
  who: Christoph
- line: Ah, I see why you’re taking part in that competition.
  sec: 2233
  time: '37:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that was a bonus. Also, the topic was interesting to me. It's about
    predicting the water flow of rivers, and I like all these ecology data tasks.
    One thought that I have is that I could also use this journey to kind of write
    a narrative for how I approached the entire challenge. I try to write down every
    day what I’m working on in the challenge – a few thoughts at least.
  sec: 2235
  time: '37:15'
  who: Christoph

    you write “Dear Diary, today this is what I tried.”?
  sec: 2265

  who: Alexey

  who: Christoph
- line: It’s electronic, I assume – not paper.
  sec: 2280
  time: '38:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's just very messy. The idea is that it shouldn't take a lot of effort to
    do it, so I write very hastily, very short sentences and just bullet points. As
    a note-taking tool, I use Obsidian. Also for other things. For this challenge,
    I have no one file, and I just dump every thought in there. Also, this logbook
    of what I do. This helps me keep focused on the project.
  sec: 2283
  time: '38:03'
  who: Christoph
- line: I guess you have these bullet points in case you want to go back to them and
    turn them into a proper text. You have all the information there. Right?
  sec: 2318
  time: '38:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. One reason that I have this is because I just wouldn't remember, “On
    day seven I struggled to make a good submission,” or whatever. The other reason
    is because, just writing itself –even if I don't ever look at it again, if I don't
    ever touch it again – it helps me to put into words or to summarize what I did
    the entire day. It's super frustrating if you just don't think about what you
    did all day. But if you write it down like two sentences, “Today, I've finished
    this part and I realized that using weather data doesn't help,” then it already
    helps me to keep focused on what I’m going to do the next day and to not get frustrated
    that maybe I didn't make as much progress because often you do more than you think,
    because you've tried many things. At least that's how I feel.
  sec: 2328
  time: '38:48'
  who: Christoph
- line: I was going to ask, “Why would somebody even do that? Why would somebody even
    write it ‘On day seven, I struggled to make a submission.’” Because it's not useful.
    But when you say that it puts things in perspective – it's not like on day seven
    you slacked and didn't do anything. [Christoph agrees]There were some problems
    and you needed to work on solving these problems. So now you know that “Okay,
    I actually worked on something.” It keeps you motivated, right?
  sec: 2380
  time: '39:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's hard to put into words, but sometimes I struggle with something,
    but I don't formulate what the problem is in my head. And then sometimes I get
    distracted and go to Twitter or do something else. But writing down what the essence
    of my problem is – for example, in this particular challenge, the problem (or
    the goal) is to predict the volume in a season. That's the total volume over a
    few months. But you have to make the predictions at different points in time.
    Some points, or some dates, are actually already within the season – so you have
    some partial data (some partial waterflow) already.
  sec: 2410
  time: '40:10'
  who: Christoph
- line: I really struggled with how to put this into my model – this knowledge – because,
    obviously, if you already know that some amount has already flown through the
    river, then you can adapt your prediction. This was kind of my problem – I was
    thinking about it for a few days, actually. But this helped me, to put this into
    writing, like, “Hey, this is what I have to achieve. This is the problem I have
    to solve – the most important one.” It's almost psychological, maybe [chuckles]
    a mental process to help focus.
  sec: 2410

  who: Christoph

  sec: 2492
  time: '41:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Very little. In the beginning, I was just writing down parts, “Okay, to understand
    the evaluation metric, I just put all the information in.” And things like, “Okay,
    these are the problems about the data.” I put that in one section. In the beginning,
    I spent maybe a little more. But this was while I was reading the description
    of the challenge – I summarized the most important parts for me. There may be
    one or two hours there. Now I just spend five or ten minutes a day. It's very
    short. I just wrote a few lines about what I did today.

    the same obstacles as your future readers. That means that when you write the
    book, you can write about these obstacles. These misunderstandings that you had
    in the beginning about the technique you're writing about or the algorithms you're
    writing about. But it may also be a very tough process for you because you have
    to learn and write at the same time.

  sec: 2588
  time: '43:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Yeah.
  sec: 2592
  time: '43:12'
  who: Christoph
- line: It’s like you misunderstood something, but you thought this is the right way
    and you write about this, and half a year later turns out that it's not and you
    have to re-do the whole thing.
  sec: 2593
  time: '43:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s also a question if you already know something. Let's say you want to
    write a book about machine learning, but you don't have the basics. Going into
    machine learning, for example, was much easier for me because I studied statistics
    – a lot of the math behind machine learning and working with data was something
    I already knew. So you should also think about where you should start from. For
    example, conforming prediction was new for me – the topic itself. But, of course,
    many of the concepts are new, even if I didn't know conformal prediction before.
    So I would say, the very best thing would be to be an expert, but still remember
    all your struggles and misunderstandings.
  sec: 2604
  time: '43:24'
  who: Christoph
- line: So you need to go down to the level of the reader, right? For example, cross
    validation – for you it’s just waking up in the middle of the night, with your
    eyes blindfolded, and you can do cross validation, right? For somebody who is
    new to that, they might not even know why it’s an important thing – how it works,
    why we need it, and what the gotchas are.
  sec: 2655
  time: '44:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you keep a logbook while learning  then you could also remember your struggles.
    [chuckles] So I think this would be the ideal setup – being an expert, but still
    remembering what it was to be a beginner.
  sec: 2676
  time: '44:36'
  who: Christoph
- header: 'Feedback Strategy: Open Drafts, Beta Readers, and Iteration'
- line: Or having a beginner who you can experiment with – someone who could say,
    “Hey, I don't understand this thing.” You can see where they struggle, right?
    [Christoph agrees] I think this is what you do with your book too, at least we
    talked about that for your first book. Because you wrote in the open, so everyone
    could see and comment and say where they don't understand. You could then take
    this feedback and incorporate it into the book. Do you still write in the open?
  sec: 2691
  time: '44:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s quite different between the books, I would say. The first book was fully
    open and I wrote it chapter by chapter. The next books were closed – most of the
    books, I guess. For Modeling Mindsets, I asked friends and colleagues to read
    individual chapters. And then, later on, for the Conformal Prediction book and
    the SHAP book, I actually asked readers if they want to be test readers. This
    worked quite well. Because then I already got people from the audience.
  sec: 2722
  time: '45:22'
  who: Christoph
- line: How did you ask readers? You have a newsletter, right? [Christoph agrees]
    So in the newsletter you can write, “Hey, I'm writing a book about this. Do you
    want to be beta users (or test readers)?” Right?
  sec: 2760
  time: '46:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. And then people say, “Hey, yes.” And then I share a Google Drive
    version of the book. So far, this worked really, really well. I got extremely
    good feedback from this process. I'm very grateful to everyone who reads my books
    before they are finished. This worked quite well for me.
  sec: 2770
  time: '46:10'
  who: Christoph
- line: Would it be problematic if you have too much feedback? If there are too many
    people who want to read your books?
  sec: 2796
  time: '46:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: I once had this problem with the SHAP book, where I invited a lot of beta
    readers. I think one problem is, of course, if you have a very problematic part,
    then all the readers will comment on this part. It's also not so good that you
    give this version to a lot of people. One lesson for me was to keep the list of
    readers small. You shouldn't have too many beta readers, I think. Rather, you
    should have more phases where you invite a few readers, incorporate the feedback,
    and have a new version of new readers for this new version. That's what worked
    best for me so far. But, of course, it prolongs the process of how long it takes
    until you can publish.
  sec: 2801
  time: '46:41'
  who: Christoph
- line: There's also the part if you don't agree with the feedback – what do you do
    then?
  sec: 2853
  time: '47:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you don't agree, you don't have to use it. I mean, that's the nature of
    feedback.
  sec: 2857
  time: '47:37'
  who: Christoph
- line: But then the person might feel offended, like, “Okay, he doesn't want to listen
    to my feedback. What am I doing here?
  sec: 2862
  time: '47:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: I haven’t had such cases so far. I think you should always double-check the
    feedback, in the sense of, “Maybe I'm wrong.” I always come from this angle, “Probably
    I'm wrong.” Because the reader is the reader – in the end, I’m writing for the
    reader. But sometimes, you can also have the case (one that I already had) where
    one reader says, “Hey, you should have a simple example in the beginning,” and
    the other reader says “Hey, why is there an example already? I haven't really
    understood what the method is about, so this should be later in the chapter.”
    So there can also be different tastes or different opinions and you just have
    to make the decision on what you think is best.
  sec: 2868
  time: '47:48'
  who: Christoph
- header: 'Advice for Aspiring Technical Writers: Start Small and Publish'
- line: And probably on what feels more natural to you personally. [Christoph agrees]
    I see. Another question I really like is, “Do you have any advice for somebody
    who is looking to start their journey as a technical author?”
  sec: 2916
  time: '48:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Don't start with a book. [chuckles] No, that's actually what I did.
    But I would say start with small units. This could be posts (like a blog post)
    or maybe even smaller – something on social media, LinkedIn, Twitter, Mastodon,
    whatever – and just start writing. For posts, you can…
  sec: 2932
  time: '48:52'
  who: Christoph
- line: Just start writing, right? That’s what… [chuckles]
  sec: 2957
  time: '49:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, just start writing, kind of. [chuckles]
  sec: 2959
  time: '49:19'
  who: Christoph
- line: Just do it. [chuckles]
  sec: 2962
  time: '49:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, because I think the biggest issue is when you write but never publish
    – this is frustrating. You don't get feedback. I think the worst that can happen
    is, if you publish but nobody reads it. But that's also the case if you never
    publish – nobody will read it for sure. I mean you can write for yourself, but
    then it's more like a diary or something. But I think just getting started is
    the most important thing. It sounds so like… dumb. But yeah – make it small and
    publish it.
  sec: 2964
  time: '49:24'
  who: Christoph
- header: 'Becoming a Full-Time Author: Timeframe, Income, and Workload'
- line: Maybe also the question is, “How can I be a full-time technical author? What
    are my steps?”
  sec: 3000
  time: '50:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hmm… Yeah, I don't know. I haven't studied many people who do this full-time.
    Actually, I think most people are just doing this on the side. Maybe they have
    a successful career, and they write one book or two on the side. Technical writing
    is something… I wouldn't recommend it, if you haven't done anything like this
    before – to just quit your job and start it. I think that's a bad idea. Because
    this is something you can actually build up to slowly.
  sec: 3008
  time: '50:08'
  who: Christoph
- line: That’s pretty much about anything, right? If you haven't done something like
    that, don't quit your job and start doing it.
  sec: 3041
  time: '50:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, if you have enough financial security, go for it. But the thing is
    if you have a job until today, and tomorrow, you say, “Okay, I’ll start technical
    writing.” Even if you’re good at it and even if you’re fast – your first income
    will come a few months later. Many months later, actually, because first you have
    to write the book, then you have to publish it, and even after publishing it,
    you have to wait like two months before… And even if you make sales on day one,
    you have to wait two months until you get the money from the sales.
  sec: 3044
  time: '50:44'
  who: Christoph
- line: How much time does it take to write a book?
  sec: 3073
  time: '51:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s really difficult to say. I would say at least a few months. It can
    take many years, depending on how much time you spend with the book and how many
    people are involved, and if there's a long editorial process behind it. For me,
    I would say like, half a year or so.
  sec: 3077
  time: '51:17'
  who: Christoph
- line: Okay. Half a year of working and then after you publish, maybe in three months,
    you'll start getting paid.
  sec: 3097
  time: '51:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: But also not full-time working, because I think you can’t work full-time on
    a book. I mean, I can’t write eight hours a day. You go crazy. So I do a lot of
    other things like, now, the challenge, obviously, but also things like posting
    on social media, newsletter writing. These are things if you want to be self-published,
    and you also need some means of distribution and reaching people. Even if you're
    not a self-publisher, you often have to do your marketing yourself.
  sec: 3106
  time: '51:46'
  who: Christoph
- line: Yeah. I published the book with Manning. It took two years. And then it feels
    like… I might be wrong, but it feels like they just want me to do all the marketing.
    [Christoph agrees] It’s like, “Why do I need you guys?” [chuckles] Right?
  sec: 3139
  time: '52:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's something I didn't expect in the beginning. I researched this
    a lot. I think it might help if you have a name tag on it from a bigger publisher
    – then it's in their library (in their shop). Because of the stamp of the publisher,
    I think it can help. Because, for me, people just have to trust in me, kind of,
    because there was no decision saying, “Okay…” [cross-talk]
  sec: 3154
  time: '52:34'
  who: Christoph
- line: You do this by already having an audience of followers. From the beginning,
    you said you were writing in the open, so people could follow you and could see
    what you’re writing about. So you already got some trust from them, right? Then,
    by the time you finish the book, they thought, “Okay, this is such a cool book,
    and we know Christoph, so we want to buy from him.”
  sec: 3179
  time: '52:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think this supplements [the marketing] because, I mean… I didn't have
    any credibility in the beginning. But I wrote the book in the open, so people
    could just see the book, and later on decide whether they want to buy it in paperback
    form, for example. There wasn't a big trust issue or anything, because they could
    just read it beforehand.

    there are websites where you can sell digital products – PDFs, videos, whatever.
    But you have physical books.
  sec: 3229
  time: '53:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first part where I sell is on Leanpub, which is PDF and eBooks. It’s just
    a digital bookstore. Then there's print-on-demand services, where you basically
    also upload a PDF file, a cover file, and put on all the details – and then you
    can self-publish there.
  sec: 3245

  sec: 3269
  time: '54:29'

    in your yard and then you do whatever you want with this?
  sec: 3270
  time: '54:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, that's fortunately not the way. I mean, you could do it this way. It would
    be much more complicated and you would have to do all the packaging and sending
    out books. I guess I would earn a bigger percentage per book, but…
  sec: 3277
  time: '54:37'
  who: Christoph
- line: But then you wouldn’t have a life – you would just do this all the time.
  sec: 3291
  time: '54:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I'm using Amazon KDP, but there are others as well. That's a kind of
    a print-on-demand service. You upload your book there and they sell it for you.
    If you buy a book of mine, then they will just print it and send it to you. So
    there's no pre-printing or having my garage full of books involved.
  sec: 3296
  time: '54:56'
  who: Christoph
- line: So when you do it through Amazon, the book appears on all Amazon stores, right?
    [Christoph agrees] In the US, in Germany, in France… [Christoph agrees] Oh, that’s
    cool.
  sec: 3321
  time: '55:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, you can actually pick the marketplaces where you want it to appear.
    You can even pick expanded distribution so it gets to the other bookstores as
    well – the bigger ones at least, like Barnes and Noble and stuff.
  sec: 3330
  time: '55:30'
  who: Christoph
- line: Ah, okay. Even that. People can even see your books in a bookstore.
  sec: 3345
  time: '55:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, so it's a good time to be a self-publisher, because there's lots of
    these platforms and tools available. I actually had some doubts whether it's a
    smart choice because of ChatGPT and stuff, when it came out. But I’m more relaxed
    now. I mean, there are lots of books that are auto-generated by large language
    models, but I still say that it's a good time to be a writer.

context: 'Context: Christoph Molnar’s journey from statistician and Kaggle competitor
  to full-time technical author frames a consistent practice: hands-on modeling, careful
  documentation, and public, iterative teaching about interpretable machine learning
  techniques (SHAP, conformal prediction, etc.), plus the practical mechanics of publishing
  and staying current.

  Core narrative: At the episode’s center is the idea that trustworthy, useful machine
  learning emerges not from opaque accuracy chasing but from a disciplined loop of
  hands-on experimentation, clear interpretation, and open communication — using interpretable
  methods and calibrated uncertainty to debug and understand models, keeping meticulous
  logs and competitions to stay sharp, and publishing incrementally (with feedback
  and transparency) to teach others while refining your own understanding. This unified
  through-line ties together the technical tools, the writing and publishing choices,
  and the everyday workflows that make complex ML accessible, reproducible, and actionable.'
