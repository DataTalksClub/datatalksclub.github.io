title: DataTalks.Club Anniversary Interview
transcript:
- line: Welcome everyone. My name is Johanna and Welcome to DataTalks.Club. DataTalks.Club
    turns three today. Woo-hoo! So we're talking about DataTalks.Club. For this occasion,
    we decided to turn the mic around, and we have a special guest today, Alexey Grigorev
    himself. So welcome Alexey!

  who: Johanna
- header: A special episode
- line: Thanks for having me. [chuckles]
  sec: 27
  time: 0:27
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes! How does it feel to be in the guest chair?
  sec: 29
  time: 0:29
  who: Johanna
- line: Uh, strange. I mean, it's not the first time I'm a podcast guest. But yeah,
    it's unusual.
  sec: 33
  time: 0:33
  who: Alexey
- line: But on your own podcast? [chuckles] Yeah, cool. I don't think I need to introduce
    Alexey too much. He's the founder of DataTalks.Club, as we all know. And the questions
    for today...
  sec: 40
  time: 0:40
  who: Johanna
- line: Maybe we should also mention some information on the host?
  sec: 54
  time: 0:54
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 60
  time: '1:00'
  who: Johanna
- line: Maybe not everyone knows that Johanna is actually the mastermind behind all
    the podcast episodes. All the questions that you hear me asking, Johanna prepares
    them? So thanks a lot for doing that.
  sec: 61
  time: '1:01'
  who: Alexey
- header: Alexey's background
- line: Yeah, no problem. It's actually quite fun sometimes to relisten to the actual
    podcast because I prepare the questions and then see what you make of it. [chuckles]
    Sometimes you stick to them, and sometimes you just you know – sway. [laughs]
    Yeah. It's been fun. This time the questions for this episode have been prepared
    mostly by the community. We've asked for questions – you can still submit questions
    on Slido. It's going to be like an AMA (ask me anything) for Alexey. But before
    we go into talking about the community and DataTalks.Club, maybe Alexey, can you
    tell us a bit about yourself – about your background and your career journey?
  sec: 77
  time: '1:17'
  who: Johanna
- line: It's funny. Usually, I ask that question and now I have to answer this too.
    [chuckles] I'm wondering how far back I should go. So I'll probably start with
    graduating with a degree in information technology. I studied information technology
    and after graduation, I worked as a Java developer for a few years. My last work
    as a Java developer was at a bank – it was a Swiss bank. They have highly regulated
    processes for everything. While the job was interesting, it was also sometimes
    mundane and kind of boring. I thought, “Okay, did I study for five years to do
    Java? Why did I study all this math?”
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: And then, during this time, the platform Coursera appeared, and one of the
    courses there was machine learning. So I took that course and I recognized that,
    “Okay, this looks like something I want to do.” I took this course, I took some
    other courses – I ended up doing a Master's degree in business intelligence. This
    is how I actually ended up in Germany. The second year of this program was in
    Germany (in Berlin). I liked the city so much that I decided to stay.
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Since graduation, I have worked as a data scientist – up to the point where
    I fully focused on DataTalks.Club, which happened this year. During this time,
    while working as a data scientist... Well, the title was “data scientist,” but
    I was doing pretty much everything, which included software engineering, data
    engineering, and ML engineering. Data science, too. But the funny thing is, my
    last work was at OLX – I worked there for four and a half years – and over this
    period, I trained a model only once.
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Wow. [chuckles]
  sec: 250
  time: '4:10'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah. I was mostly doing the engineering stuff there, even though my title
    was “data scientist”. It's a fun fact. Now, since April, I'm fully focused on
    DataTalks.Club.
  sec: 251
  time: '4:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: That is really exciting. Do you still... What language did you use in your
    job? Probably not Java, right? You probably specialized in Python?
  sec: 267
  time: '4:27'
  who: Johanna
- line: Right now, mostly English. [chuckles]
  sec: 277
  time: '4:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I mean the programming language. [laughs]
  sec: 279
  time: '4:39'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yes. [chuckles] Well, for DataTalks.Club, it's English. Well, we use Python
    for courses and I sometimes occasionally write little scripts to help with moderation,
    with some other things – for example, for the courses that we do, all the scripts
    are in Python. For me the go-to language is Python. I think I still remember some
    Java – I can still do a bit of JavaScript. Some of the code that we use for DataTalks.Club,
    for example – the code for generating certificates. When you finish a course you
    get the certificate. That code is written with JavaScript. But yeah, it's mostly
    Python.
  sec: 280
  time: '4:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I started with Java way back, but I didn't stay for very long. [chuckles]
    Python is definitely the better language, I think, especially for machine learning.
    Cool! Thank you so much, Alexey, I think I might actually jump into the first
    question. We have questions both collected on Slack and via LinkedIn on Slido.
    I think we'll start with the Slido ones.
  sec: 326
  time: '5:26'
  who: Johanna
- header: Plans for the future of DataTalks.Club
- line: The first question is “Happy birthday, DataTalks.Club!” Thank you. “What are
    the plans for the future?”
  sec: 355
  time: '5:55'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah. Luckily, I had access to these questions before the interview, otherwise
    – this and some other ones, I would have trouble answering. Right now, I want
    to focus on making it sustainable. Since this is my main job right now, I want
    to also make sure I don't starve – so I have enough money to survive. Berlin is
    not the cheapest city [to live in]. For me, right now, I'm focusing on making
    it sustainable and making sure that there is enough income for me and for the
    team.
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are also two people working for DataTalks.Club – Francis and Valeria.
    Francis is the community manager. He takes care of... He's basically running everything
    behind the scenes. All the events are organized by him, all the YouTube videos
    are published by him, when we need to publish something or edit. He edits a lot
    of videos. Basically, he's doing pretty much everything. I would not be able to
    run the community without his help.
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, a massive shout-out to Francis. He's pretty amazing.
  sec: 438
  time: '7:18'
  who: Johanna
- line: So if you were ever a speaker or a guest at DataTalks.Club (Johanna was),
    usually Francis takes care of reaching out and organizing everything. And then
    we have Valeria. Valeria takes care of the newsletter, and the social media content,
    and she helps a lot with other things. I need to pay them. Of course, they like
    what they do. [chuckles] But it's a job. [Johanna agrees] So I need to pay them.
    And I need to also get money. For me, for us, the focus right now is to see how
    to make it work. So far, it's been good but I still want to focus on getting more
    sponsors for the community while also trying to not overdo it.
  sec: 442
  time: '7:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think if we push too heavily for monetization, it will not help attract
    more people. We need to find the right balance. What we're doing right now is
    good – we just need to find more sponsors. I think we managed to find the right
    balance, but we just need to find more companies that want to support us. So that's
    my main activity right now – my main focus. But apart from that, of course, we
    have a lot of activities. We want to continue doing these activities. One of the
    things that quite often comes up right now is people asking for an LLM course
    – an LLM Zoomacamp.
  sec: 442
  time: '7:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, yeah. Of course.
  sec: 546
  time: '9:06'
  who: Johanna
- line: There could be one. I cannot promise anything. Right now, I'm not sure if
    this is just hype and whether everyone wants that because it's a hype thing. Probably,
    it would be wise to wait for six to twelve months in order to see what happens
    if the hype dies out or it's still there. And if it's still there, it's possible
    that we will consider making another course. But also, for example, we are quite
    lucky with the three courses we have. Right now, we are running a machine learning
    engineering course (ML Zoomcamp) and it does not change significantly from year
    to year. So we need to maintain the content a little bit, but most of the content
    is the content that I recorded three years ago. So we're kind of lucky. With LLM,
    things change every day, right?
  sec: 549
  time: '9:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. It's so fast-going. It's such a new field. I think it's come up. Yeah,
    I agree. But it could also be broader – not only LLM but more general AI. Very
    exciting! I didn't know that. Yeah, it's quite the hype at the moment. Very cool.
    The reason that I got this job is basically that I once mentioned to Alexey that
    I listen to every episode of the podcast because I'm an avid podcast lover. I
    do fully agree that some podcasts just have ads – a couple of ads are fine, but
    if it gets too much, it's just not good. I agree, there needs to be a balance.
    You also don't want to abuse people in some way. [chuckles] But the creator also
    needs to live. It's definitely a fine balance. Yeah, very cool.
  sec: 605
  time: '10:05'
  who: Johanna
- header: How LLMs will change the professional data landscape
- line: Let's actually move to the next question, which kind of touches on what we've
    just discussed. “How do you think the other jobs will change as different GPT-like
    services come into play and extend the skills of data professionals?”
  sec: 670
  time: '11:10'
  who: Johanna
- line: That's an interesting thing. Of course, nobody knows. Right? [Johanna agrees]
    We'll only see that in a year or two, when people start using them actively. Right
    now, even though it's quite a hot area, some data scientists are still hesitant
    to try them. But once the community starts to adopt it more, then it will become
    interesting. I recently spoke with a friend of mine, also my ex-colleague – he's
    running his own startup right now. He says, right now, the main challenge when
    hiring (when evaluating) candidates is ChatGPT – because everyone can just copy
    and paste the take-home test and GPT will just provide the solution. [Johanna
    agrees]
  sec: 686
  time: '11:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: So they were there thinking what to do with this and I liked the metaphor
    he used, for example you know there is weed, which is considered a drug – marijuana
    – and many countries try to fight it. But some countries say, “Okay, let's just
    embrace it and allow people to use it because there is no point in fighting it.
    People will still smoke weed.” He was comparing weed with ChatGPT. [laughs] “Let's
    legalize ChatGPT. Let's not forbid it.” You can tell people, “You cannot use ChatGPT.”
    But people will still use it. [Johanna agrees] But what about just saying, “Hey,
    for our take home test, you can use ChatGPT, you just have to tell us what prompts
    you used, how exactly you used it, what the problems were? What were the cases
    when it was not correct and you needed to fix something? Tell us about that.”
    And I think this is a nice approach.
  sec: 686
  time: '11:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Instead of saying, “Hey, ChatGPT will take our jobs,” we should just learn
    to use it and learn to accept it and see what happens. Right? [Johanna agrees]
    We'll see how it goes. I imagine most things, like mundane exploratory data analysis
    or just training a simple model – with ChatGPT, you can just ask it and it will
    give you the code, and then you just use it. But it's still not ideal. It's still
    buggy. It still hallucinates. It still comes up with functions that do not exist
    and whatnot
  sec: 686
  time: '11:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. Yeah.
  sec: 848
  time: '14:08'
  who: Johanna
- line: So yeah, let's see.
  sec: 850
  time: '14:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's very interesting that you say “we” because I just moved to the
    Netherlands. [laughs] And of course, it's one of the most progressive countries
    with this. But that's actually a really nice approach. I like that. I think many
    companies use whiteboard challenges when they're hiring. It's the same in your
    normal life – you just Google. In some ways, ChatGPT is not that much more than
    Googling. I mean, it can nicely give you something formatted that you can just
    hand over, but still. I think it's a very good idea, actually. Yeah. Very cool.
    Nice.
  sec: 851
  time: '14:11'
  who: Johanna
- header: How DTC community members can contribute
- line: Let's move on to the next question that goes back to DataTalks.Club, “From
    your perspective, how can members best contribute to and benefit from their involvement
    in DataTalks.Club?”
  sec: 896
  time: '14:56'
  who: Johanna
- line: I think the best thing you can do is be active on Slack. For DataTalks.Club,
    Slack is like the center of the community. Of course, we have many, many different
    activities, like the podcast, courses – but it kind of still centers around Slack.
    There are questions in Slack that are sometimes left without answers and I cannot
    physically go and answer them, even though sometimes I do know the answer – I
    cannot just go and answer that. It's already happening to a pretty large extent.
    I see a lot of community members jumping on and answering questions. So if more
    of us do that, I think the world will become a better place.
  sec: 910
  time: '15:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, why did I suggest that? Of course, it's good that you help – but
    I also am looking back at my career, and I'm thinking about things that helped
    me in my career. When I just started my journey as a Java developer, the first
    thing I did was join a Java community. It was online forums. I used that forum
    to ask questions. But I did not have that many questions and I noticed that a
    lot of people were asking questions, and I was able to answer some of these questions.
    But I also noticed that there were questions that I was not able to answer. Some
    of these questions were interesting. I thought, “How about I do a bit of research?”
    And find out how to actually answer these questions. So I set aside like half
    an hour every day to do that – to help people. Over time, it accumulated. I learned
    a lot of new things. By just doing a bit of research, doing a bit of Googling,
    and trying some things, and figuring out what was wrong and how to help that person,
    I was able to learn so much myself that at the next job already, I had no difficulties
    whatsoever in passing the job interview. Also, they doubled my salary because
    it was so easy for me to pass the interview. I was so confident that I'd be not
    only qualified for this job, but I could do everything that was needed. It's because
    of the communities.
  sec: 910
  time: '15:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: The same thing happened when I became a data scientist. When I got my first
    job as a data scientist, I also joined a data science community and I was doing
    the same thing. I was just hanging out in a Slack community. It was a Russian-speaking
    community called Open Data Science, which actually inspired me to create DataTalks.Club.
    I think one of the questions is about that, so I'll talk about that later. I was
    just hanging out there, asking my own questions, but also helping others. And
    it helped me too. It helped me tremendously. So what you can do to benefit from
    the involvement in the community is just go there and ask questions, even though
    maybe you don't know the answer. You can add a disclaimer saying, “Hey, I have
    not dealt with this myself, but I did a quick Googling and this is what I found
    out. Here is the result.” This will help everyone. That's one thing.
  sec: 910
  time: '15:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Apart from Slack, we have many other things. For example, we have three courses.
    If you graduated from some of these courses, and you want to help with the course,
    you can help by... Maybe you want to be a teaching assistant. That's also an option.
    You can ping me in Slack and say, “Hey, I really enjoyed doing MLOIps Zoomcamp.
    Can I be a teaching assistant there?” Or you can just, again, hang out in the
    course channels and answer questions from other community members. That will be
    super helpful. Then we have a few things like – we want to run a competition.
  sec: 910
  time: '15:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Last year, we did a Kaggle competition. It was a deep learning competition.
    We needed to classify images of different kitchen utensils – like forks, spoons,
    or just kitchen stuff like cups – into these categories. There is a picture of
    a spoon and the model needs to say that it's a spoon. It was a very fun competition
    and we want to do something similar this year. If you have some ideas, what the
    competition could be about and how to get the data for this completion (which
    is the most difficult part) then please reach out, and let's think about how to
    do that.
  sec: 910
  time: '15:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: I remember you collected the data last year, right? [Alexey agrees] Yeah,
    I remember that.
  sec: 1216
  time: '20:16'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah, it was fun. Maybe this year, it could be something with LLMs, too. With
    LLMs, you can... Let's say you have a lot of text data and you can label this
    data with LLMs, or generate data with LLMs. It could be that, too. Another thing
    we have is called Project of the Week. The idea behind Project of the Week is
    more like – most of the content we have is us showing you how to do something,
    and we repeat it.
  sec: 1223
  time: '20:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, we have workshops (or we have the courses), and in the workshop,
    there is a video and somebody is doing something and you follow along. But Project
    of the Week is different. It's more like a do-it-yourself thing. You get some
    instructions where it's not something you have to do today, but it's more like
    a suggestion, “This is what you can do today.” For example, let's say we want
    you to learn FastAPI or something like that – a new framework. There are some
    things you can do to learn this thing. We give you a set of suggestions and every
    day you try to look something up on Google, try to do something, and then every
    day you can say, “Okay, this is my progress.” The idea is, after seven days, you
    have a complete project that you can put in your portfolio. That's the idea behind
    Project of the Week.
  sec: 1223
  time: '20:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: We have quite a few community members who are active there, who are helping
    a lot with that, and coming up with project ideas. One of them, Antonis, is in
    this live chat. Hi Antonis! And the other one is Liliana. So thanks a lot for
    your help. The reason I'm saying that – if you have some ideas, or you want to
    learn something new, you can help with organizing this Project of the Week as
    well. There's actually a lot more. I think I can talk for hours about what you
    can do. But we have a lot of other questions, right?
  sec: 1223
  time: '20:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. DataTalks.Club is massive! I'm still always surprised how you do all
    of these things. Because we also have the webinars and the podcast. People think
    they are interesting. If people think they are interesting, they can also probably
    reach out to Francis. We are always looking for new guests. I think, in general,
    the one thing that people can benefit from, which DataTalks.Club uses quite a
    bit, it's this Learning in Public. Always, if you learn something, Tweet it or
    talk about it, and we will probably also promote it. I think it's also a big part
    of the Zoomcamps.
  sec: 1356
  time: '22:36'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yes. Thanks for mentioning this.
  sec: 1395
  time: '23:15'
  who: Alexey
- header: Main lessons Alexey learned while building the DataTalks.Club community
- line: Yeah. Cool. So then we move on, “What are the main lessons learned from your
    experience in building the DTC online community?”
  sec: 1398
  time: '23:18'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah, so that was also why I was lucky to be able to see this question before
    the interview, because it's a difficult question to answer, to be honest. I did
    a bit of brainstorming and I came up with a few things. I remember, at the beginning,
    the goal was quite ambitious. The goal was to create a community for all data
    people, which includes data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, data product
    managers, ML engineers – everyone who deals with data. But with time, I realized
    that it's too broad. It's not possible to be that broad. There are already communities
    – for example, there's a community called Locally Optimistic, who focus more on
    data product managers and data analysts. There is an MLOps community that focuses
    more on MLOps.
  sec: 1412
  time: '23:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'We also got the idea to focus on something – DataTalks.Club it was more beginner-friendly,
    with hands-on learning for a lot of our content. The focus is more on people who
    are starting their career or are continuing it, rather than who are advanced in
    their career, and with a lot of focus on hands-on stuff, and with a focus on the
    engineering aspects of data: ML engineering, data engineering, and MLOps. So these
    are engineering-heavy things where you need to code a lot. Our podcast is still
    kinda... Well, it''s not super technical, but we still talk about careers and
    things that also appeal more to the beginner-intermediate level of audience rather
    than professionals. [Johanna agrees] I guess, with time, we actually found some
    focus. But still, one of the lessons is, “You cannot be too ambitious. You need
    to focus on something.” Then another thing is moderation – I did not expect that
    moderation would take so much time.'
  sec: 1412
  time: '23:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: There was a funny story that a few times people tried to use the community
    as a dating website. [Johanna laughs] I don't know if there were any success stories.
    But I know that there were unsuccessful stories when ladies in the community did
    not like the attention they received from some community members. [Johanna groans]
    Of course, this is not why you join a professional community – to get private
    messages saying, “Hey, cutie. How about a date?” So yeah – I had to deal with
    this stuff. Maybe there was a successful case – a love story... [laughs] But I'm
    not aware of that. Most of the time, it was unsolicited attention. In general,
    moderation is...
  sec: 1412
  time: '23:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'People are trying to promote their services, either in public or in private
    messages. In private messages, it''s more difficult because I don''t see that.
    In public, I can just remove the post but if somebody is trying to send unsolicited
    promotion through direct messages, it''s very difficult to catch that. Sometimes
    they send this promotion message to me too, and then I know what to do. But they''re
    careful and see, “Okay, this person is an admin. I will not send him a message.”
    And then send it to other people. If something like that happens, please let Francis
    or me know about that and we will ban this person, because it''s against our community
    guidelines to send unsolicited promotional messages in DM. I also did a bit of
    automation with that. When somebody joins the #general channel (when somebody
    joins the community and immediately jumps to the general channel) and posts a
    big promotional message, I already have a script (a bot) that removes that and
    sends an automatic direct message to that person saying, “Hey, it''s against the
    rules. We have these channels. This is how the messages should be formatted if
    you want to publish something.” So for me, it''s just a matter of adding a special
    reaction to this post, and then the bot handles that. That was fun to create.

- line: What was surprising for me was how eager people were to join the community
    and participate in different activities, and to also do something in the community
    as well. That's really cool. I'm still trying to figure out how to recognize and
    encourage this and reward  this participation – reward the participants. One thing
    [I do] is invite them to the podcast. There is probably more we can do, so I'm
    still thinking about that. But it's really rewarding to see that people are very
    active in the community and are doing something for the community too. That's
    really cool. Thanks for doing that. Thanks Antonis, one more time. I know you're
    here and you're listening. You're doing a lot for this community – thanks!
  sec: 1412

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think, in general, people are quite happy to... At least for me, people
    have an interest, and if they find people that have similar interests, it's just
    really great. Although, like you said, there might be some, you know... It's always
    good to have a code of conduct to guide these conversations.

    behind starting the club and the Zoomcamps?” I think we've touched briefly on
    that.
  sec: 1780
  time: '29:40'
  who: Johanna
- line: We did, yeah. For me, as I said, communities for quite a big part of my life
    and career. They helped me a lot. I was quite active in this Russian-speaking
    community called Open Data Science. Sadly, I couldn't find anything similar in
    the English-speaking space, meaning a community that was also active, that was
    also on Slack. My initial idea was to create something similar to that. Actually,
    the story of how it happened is – I was doing some career consultations and a
    lot of people were reaching out to me on LinkedIn saying, “Hey, I'm a data analyst.
    I want to become a data scientist.” Or “I'm a software engineer, I want to become
    a data engineer.” or I don't know, “Help me figure out what I want from life.”
    Things like that. Back then – it was during COVID, so I also kind of wanted to
    talk to people. Sitting at home was not fun.
  sec: 1797
  time: '29:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: So I was doing these free career consultations, which involve talking to a
    person and then sending them a summary. I'm not doing that now. But back then,
    it was fun. I did like 30 of these consultations and I thought, “It would be very
    nice to have a place where all these people can hang out and help each other.”
    Because if I try to help everyone, it's not scalable. I can't help every single
    person.
  sec: 1797
  time: '29:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: It might also get repetitive or something. Yeah.
  sec: 1891
  time: '31:31'
  who: Johanna
- line: It becomes very repetitive. For example, for “How do I become a machine learning
    engineer?” The answer is something like, “Go buy my book.” But people might find
    this answer annoying, because it's very promotional. Anyways – I thought, “If
    there was a space where all these people can hang out and help each other, it
    would be more not me helping everyone, but people helping each other – for example,
    I help somebody, and that person would help somebody else, and then that person
    in turn, would help somebody else.”
  sec: 1895
  time: '31:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: One day I woke up, I registered the Slack community, I went to GoDaddy and
    bought a domain (I think  it cost like 15 euros or something like that) and then
    I put a link out... I did not advertise it anywhere. I put this link to my LinkedIn
    page. I did not make a post, it was just in the description. And I put it in my
    GitHub. Then I started looking at what would happen. And people were joining it.
    [Johanna surprised] They would accidentally see this link, or somebody else would
    say, “Hey, like, I found this cool community. Join it.” In a week, maybe there
    were a hundred people.
  sec: 1895
  time: '31:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Wow!
  sec: 1980
  time: '33:00'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah. In a month, it was more than a few hundred. I did not actively promote
    it. Community members would just say, “Hey, there is this cool place. Check it
    out.” It was pretty motivating. At some point, a friend of mine asked if I knew
    a place where he can give a talk and I told him to come over and give a talk.
    It was our first webinar/workshop and since then, we started having regular activities
    – regular events. I think the other part of the question was about the Zoomcamps,
    right?
  sec: 1981
  time: '33:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah.
  sec: 2026
  time: '33:46'
  who: Johanna
- line: I always wanted to do a course. When I was in this Open Data Science Community,
    there was a very good course called MLCourse.AI. It's also available in English.
    I did this in Russian, but it's also translated. It was a free course, with focus
    on the theory behind machine learning, with a lot of coding, also there was a
    competition. It was so well-organized. The main thing that I liked about that
    was that it was community-driven. There was, of course, the project lead (course
    lead), but also lessons were prepared by different community members, and these
    community members were helping each other in Slack when the course was running.
    I thought, “That's so cool. It's such a great thing. The course is for free, people
    help each other, and people share stories about how they did this and how they
    found a great job after finishing this course.” I thought “It's so cool. I want
    to have something like that in our community too.”
  sec: 2030
  time: '33:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Also, I think I mentioned the book – I wrote a book about machine learning
    engineering at some point. This book was not selling well. It's still not selling
    well. It's very hard to compete against other really great books, because there
    are so many good books about machine learning. Now, in retrospect, I think maybe
    it did not make much sense to write another one because there were so many of
    them out already
  sec: 2030
  time: '33:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, since you created the courses, now, they are basically complementing
    the book, right? Basically.
  sec: 2125
  time: '35:25'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah... But I was thinking, “How can I promote the book? What's the best way
    of doing that?” These two ideas – this course that I really liked and I have a
    book that I want to promote – they kind of came together. I thought, “How about
    I make a course based on the book, and then it would help with promoting the book,
    it will help with promoting the community and it will help do what I want – the
    data course.”
  sec: 2131
  time: '35:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I ran a post on LinkedIn or something like that. I did not put any effort
    into that. I just wanted to check if there is interest. And there was a lot of
    interest, so I thought, “Okay, I'm doing that.” This is how we did the first course,
    ML Zoomcamp. As I said, it did not help with promoting the book. I mean, people
    knew about the book, but not many of them were actually buying it. [chuckles]
    Because the course is for free, right?
  sec: 2131
  time: '35:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. [chuckles]
  sec: 2198
  time: '36:38'
  who: Johanna
- line: Why pay for it? I don't think I would pay for the book, to be honest. But
    yeah... And to be honest, I don't get a lot of money from selling the book. It
    did help, to some extent, with promoting it. Without the course, even fewer people
    would buy it. But now, actually, some people say, “Hey, I bought this book and
    use it as a textbook for the course.” Which is cool.
  sec: 2200

    community? Would you have created a meetup or something in Berlin otherwise?

  who: Alexey

  sec: 2236
  time: '37:16'
  who: Johanna
- line: It is a COVID baby. I don't think people would be so eager to join an online
    community if it was today, for example. The timing was right. Even though, for
    me, the idea from the beginning was to create an online community, the fact that
    it was during the COVID helped. Right now, I think during COVID, at the beginning,
    it was kind of okay, and in 2020, it was okay – in 2021, there was already so
    much stuff happening online. But this community already had some momentum. There
    were already community members, the courses, and so on. I think starting during
    COVID time helped, especially in September. I remember that the summer was fine
    and people were hoping that normal life would come back, but then in September,
    cases started to go up again, everyone was locked at home again. It was just the
    right timing. I don't think it would do as well now – if I started DataTalks.Club
    today, I don't think it would do as well as three years ago.
  sec: 2240
  time: '37:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Although, on the other hand, I think a lot of communities were created,
    at least from the podcasts side, because I listen to a lot of podcasts – a lot
    of podcasts were created during COVID but they all stopped now. So I think it
    is something special that this community is still alive, because a lot of them
    didn't survive the COVID craze.
  sec: 2317
  time: '38:37'

    We had too many other things.

    things! Cool. Here's an interesting one, “What typical, not extraordinary, success
    stories of your students can you share over the last year?”
  sec: 2351
  time: '39:11'
  who: Johanna
- line: Not extraordinary? Oh! Meaning “usual”. Well, we had cases when people wanted
    to switch their careers and they did. I didn't know what else to say. [chuckles].
    For example, just yesterday, one of the podcast guests, Marijn – I interviewed
    him, and the talk was called Hacking Your Data Career – Marijn Markus. It was
    like a year or two ago. He reached out to me through LinkedIn saying that he attended
    a conference PyData, Amsterdam and somebody at that conference approached him
    saying, “Hey, I listened to your interview on DataTalks.Club and this interview
    changed my life.” He got so inspired that he switched his career and now he works
    as a data engineer. Not only that interview, but he also did our data engineering
    Zoomcamp and he changed his career. Then Marijn reached out to me saying, “Hey,
    this is such a cool thing to hear, when somebody approaches you at the conference
    and says, 'Hey! Look, not only do I know you, but also you changed my life!'”
    [chuckles]
  sec: 2372
  time: '39:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, wow! That's pretty much the dream. Yeah, wow.
  sec: 2450
  time: '40:50'
  who: Johanna
- line: These things are typical – not an extraordinary story. There were, of course,
    stories when there was somebody who was a student at school and then did our ML
    Engineering Zoomcamp, and got an internship. He did pretty well there, but then
    decided, “Okay, I want to study at university.” And he left. I think it's pretty
    cool when people earlier in their career, even before the university, already
    have access to materials like that, can learn something, and then already be ready
    to do the job. I don't think it's a typical situation. I don't think most of our
    community members and students are school students. [Johanna agrees] I think,
    usually, most of the students are more... They're not students anymore. They're
    already working in some roles and they want to change.
  sec: 2456
  time: '40:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. In general, I think podcasts are good. Usually, why I listen to them
    is because of the inspiration and motivation. It doesn't need me to be, “Oh, I
    changed my career after that.” But I often wake up in the morning, and I just
    don't want to work. Then I listen to someone who did something amazing and I'm
    like, “Okay, I can do this. This person did these amazing things, so I can go
    and finish this analysis (or whatever).” Sometimes it's even small things. Very
    cool. I do think that these communities impact so many people in so many ways,
    which is good. It's really good. Cool.

    in upcoming club events or interviews?
  sec: 2572
  time: '42:52'
  who: Johanna
- line: The thing with me is, I'm not really interested in chasing hype topics. That's
    why, only one month ago, we had our first interview about LLMs, which was super
    late, considering how long ChatGPT has been around. We were super late to the
    party with an LLM interview. The way we usually do it – I'm more interested in
    interviewing a specific person, and then see what kind of topics they want to
    share. Usually, there are a few things anyone can talk about and you, Johanna,
    know more than anyone because you do these initial calls with our guests to explore
    what things they can share. For me, it's more about the person, and then figuring
    out what this person can talk about. Or maybe we have done something previously,
    but there can be different angles on it.
  sec: 2580
  time: '43:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's why I don't know what exactly... I'm not really following trends. Actually,
    there were two talks about LLMs. It was a coincidence. In both these cases, there
    were specific people that I wanted to interview and it turned out that, in both
    these cases, the topic was LLMs – and they were not conflicting with each other.
    They were slightly different. This is how I like to approach that. But maybe you
    can suggest some topics. For example, if there is a topic that you're interested
    in and we haven't done a podcast interview about that, just reach out to one of
    us and suggest that. Also, if you know a speaker who can talk about that, it would
    be even better.
  sec: 2580

    whole history. [chuckles] No kidding. [laughs]
  sec: 2704
  time: '45:04'
  who: Johanna
- line: It's kind of difficult. I think it's okay to repeat a little bit. If we talked
    about mentoring three years ago, maybe we can do another podcast episode about
    mentoring from a different perspective.
  sec: 2711
  time: '45:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly, because it's always a different person, so it's definitely a different
    angle.
  sec: 2726
  time: '45:26'
  who: Johanna
- line: I think we would run out of topics by now otherwise. [chuckles]
  sec: 2730

    moment, right?

    from Antonis, actually.
  sec: 2748
  time: '45:48'
  who: Johanna
- line: I was thinking about that. I don't know – for me, the most funny story was
    that people considered using DataTalks.Club as a dating website. [laughs] I could
    not even imagine that this would happen. It just did not occur to me at all. Of
    course, I did not think of putting this on the website, or in our code of conduct
    – in the community guidelines. It just did not occur to me that it's possible
    that somebody might use a professional community to reach out to... In this case,
    it was a male reaching out to female participants. It's kind of funny, but also
    gross. So, I don't know. [chuckles] But it was memorable.
  sec: 2765
  time: '46:05'

    in the first place.

  sec: 2822

    yeah, it's definitely... You never anticipate enough to be... People always surprise
    you.
  sec: 2824
  time: '47:04'
  who: Johanna
- line: But also, if you're a female participant and you get some attention that you
    don't want to receive, the knee-jerk reaction would probably be to leave the community.
    But I would ask you to give us another chance. Report that person and stick around.
    It's not appropriate behavior and we do not encourage this behavior. We would
    deal with this person and we want to have a safe space where everyone can learn,
    share knowledge, and so on.
  sec: 2841

  who: Alexey

    of communities as a woman – in the more techie space – the percentage of women
    in DTC is actually quite high. You can always reach out to other women or to me,
    if you want to [chuckles] or to Alexey..

    touched on that one a little bit. Do you want to talk about that?
  sec: 2908
  time: '48:28'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah. I see that we don't have a lot of time, so I'll try to give a short
    answer. [laughs] I don't think I'm capable of giving short answers in general.
    [chuckles] I'll try. It's not my first book. So the first book... Well, this is
    a long story. I'll tell you. Some time ago, I was reviewing books for Packt Publishing,
    which is a publisher. I was still transitioning from a Java developer to a data
    scientist and they reached out to me saying, “Hey, we found your blog about Java
    and we have this book about Java. How about you review this book?” I did that
    – I was a technical reviewer. Then I reviewed another book and another book, and
    then I said, “Look, maybe you can start sending me machine learning books, because
    this is what I'm more interested in.” And they said, “Okay. Here's the machine
    learning book.” They did not even try to check if I knew this topic, which was
    cool. By then, hopefully, I learned enough of machine learning to be able to help.
  sec: 2918
  time: '48:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: I reviewed maybe five more books about machine learning and they wrote to
    me saying, “Hey, you're so good at reviewing the books, maybe you want to write
    one.” So I thought, “Hmm, maybe I do.” And they said, “Okay, it looks like you
    know Java. You know machine learning. How about writing a book about Java and
    machine learning?” Back then I thought it was a good idea. Don't do that. It's
    not a good idea. [Johanna laughs] Because who cares about Java and machine learning?
    Everyone uses Python. But back then I thought it was a good idea, so I wrote the
    book. It's called Mastering Java for Data Science, something like that – I don't
    remember. So that was my first book. Usually, when you write a book, the contract
    includes the publisher giving you some advance money – an advance payment. Then,
    with each sold copy, you get some royalty percent. With this book, they gave some
    advance payment money, and the book still hasn't reached that point when it would
    break even. It's not selling well. But, I would also expect more promotion from
    the publisher.
  sec: 2918
  time: '48:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Anyway, then there was another book that I wrote with co-authors – I wasn't
    alone there. It was like four or five authors. I did not like that book, that's
    why don't put it in my CV. It was about TensorFlow projects. It was a book about
    doing projects with TensorFlow. It was like 10 chapters, and each chapter was
    a project. But the funny thing is, even though I did not like the book – I did
    not like the outcome, I did not like the process and I wanted to pretend this
    book never happened... The funny thing is that people from a different publisher
    noticed that book and reached out to me saying, “We saw this book. We really liked
    it.” It was a surprise for me, “Why would anyone like it?” But they did and they
    said, “We want to have a similar book. How about you write this book?” We decided
    to come up with this concept that there is a chapter, and every chapter is a project.
    Then by the end of each chapter, you have a project that you can put in your portfolio.
  sec: 2918
  time: '48:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: So this is how we came up with this concept and I started writing this Machine
    Learning Bookcamp. Actually, it was their idea to name it that – somebody from
    marketing at Manning decided that this is a good title. It took two years, I think.
    Manning is really... They put a lot of effort into making sure that the books
    are of very good quality. It was very painful – all these processes. They are
    there for a reason, but for me as an author, it was like, “Ugh, there are 10 more
    comments that I need to address. I'm so tired. Why did they agree to this?” [chuckles]
    Finally, this book came out and the rest of the study, you know – how it became
    a course and so on.
  sec: 2918
  time: '48:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's pretty amazing. I didn't know that. But it also seems that your blog
    was kind of the starting point. [cross-talk]
  sec: 3194

  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah! And it was in Russian. I don't know how they found it.
  sec: 3201
  time: '53:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh! My God. So is that the takeaway? If you want to start with publishing,
    start with a blog maybe? What I wanted to ask is, at what stage of the publishing
    process were you reviewing for Packt?
  sec: 3203
  time: '53:23'
  who: Johanna
- line: It was when each chapter was ready – they would send a draft and I would review
    the draft.
  sec: 3221
  time: '53:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's really early then.
  sec: 3227
  time: '53:47'
  who: Johanna
- line: Yeah. It wasn't like, “Okay, here's a book. Review it.” It was as the book
    was being written, they would send each chapter to me. I would then review it
    and send it back. For my book, it was a different process. They have in-house
    technical reviewers who do this for each of the chapters, but there are three
    or four chapters and it's sent to two people for the viewing – to not in-house
    reviewers. So the process is slightly different. So it was for work-in-progress
    books.
  sec: 3230
  time: '53:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Wow. There's also this Discord channel by Packt, where they have these giveaways
    where you get books – but they're finished. Basically, you're the reviewer from
    the public. You can get them, and you can read them, and then write a short review.

    to them. It's the last stage before it gets published, basically. They solicit
    feedback from the community, basically. But it's a good way to get books for free.
    [chuckles] They've done that a couple of times, so that's why I was interested.

    anything you would love to do but didn't have the time to do?”

- line: Oh, yeah. I think I have a list somewhere with all these ideas that we wanted
    to try, but never managed to. For example, doing a hackathon is one thing that
    comes to mind. For example, in the courses, we have a lot of questions and these
    questions are so repetitive. We have FAQ documents where all these questions are
    already answered or most of these questions there was an idea to somehow automate
    it and write a bot.
  sec: 3339
  time: '55:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: But interestingly, even without running a proper hackathon, some community
    members – one of them is Alex – he came up with this idea, “Hey, how about I do
    this myself?” When he reached out, it was already a working thing, saying, “Hey,
    I did this. How about we test it now?” It was so cool. Yeah, it's working fine.
    He did this for the MLOps course and now he's doing this for the ML engineering
    course. So it's really cool and it works quite well. The bot would look at the
    question and then look at all the... Of course, it uses LLMs – it would look at
    all the other questions in the FAQ document and say, “Okay, for this question,
    this is the answer.” This typical use case for LLMs, where it has a knowledge
    base, and you have a question, and you want to retrieve the answer to this question
    from this knowledge base. He wrote a post on LinkedIn saying what the stack behind
    that was. It's a really cool project. So I wanted to make a hackathon but never
    managed, but then... It just happened. [chuckles]

    like Eventbrite – it's not the most convenient platform. But the cool thing about
    Eventbrite is that it stores the emails of each person who registered. What we
    can do with this is build a recommender system that says, “Okay, this person would
    be interested in these events.” For example, when there is a new event, we potentially
    can see which community members would be interested in this particular event,
    and then send emails or somehow notify them about this. Of course, we need to
    think about opting out, opting in to that – but as an idea, this what we have.

- line: In addition to that, I don't really like Eventbrite, so maybe creating something
    in Django for managing events would be another thing. It could be another hackathon
    project. But then, with so many things already happening, it's always hard to
    find time to squeeze in one extra thing. Maybe, if any one of you is listening
    to this and you like this idea of a Hackathon, maybe you can reach out to us and
    we'll see how we can make it happen.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, hackathons are amazing, but they're just epiphany of time-intensive,
    right? You sign up for a couple of days of your life, if you want to do it like
    that. But they're very cool. I've done several hackathons and I love it. But yeah,
    it's definitely easier when you're a student because you can just be missing.

- header: Evaluating the success of DataTalks.Club
- line: Yep. “How do you evaluate the success of the efforts of the initiative and
    purpose?”
  sec: 3559
  time: '59:19'
  who: Johanna
- line: There are a few metrics that I look at. In terms of bringing money, the most
    effective thing is our newsletter. So if you're subscribed to our newsletter,
    you probably saw that there is a sponsored block in the newsletter. This is how
    maybe 50-60% of money that we earn at DataTalks.Club comes from. For us, the number
    of subscribers who open the email is an important metric because it directly translates
    to money. So this is what I look at. When it's growing and people keep opening
    the email, despite the fact that this is the sponsored block, that's really good.
    This is what I personally look at.
  sec: 3572
  time: '59:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Then, of course, the number of people in the community. Right now, it's almost
    40,000. But also, the other interesting metric is the number of active people.
    Of course, not all 40,000  are active. Somebody comes for the course, they take
    the course, and leave the community – which is totally fine. Or maybe somebody
    comes and finds out, “Okay, I'm not really interested in this community,” and
    leaves. This is also fine. But looking at the number of active people is another
    metric that I look at. Also, engagement in social media – this is something that
    I think is quite important because social media helps us bring new people to the
    community. YouTube views – if the content is interesting, a stream usually has
    more views on YouTube than non-interesting content. Then we get the signal to
    see what really resonates with the community.
  sec: 3572
  time: '59:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Again, another big thing is, “Are sponsors willing to give us money? “Do they
    find this community attractive enough for them to actually give us money?” That's
    probably the main success criteria, I'd say. If they do, then we're doing something
    useful, because there are companies who want to support us.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, very cool. I think we have maxed out the hour. There are two more questions
    left, but maybe you can answer them in Slack or something.

  who: Johanna

  sec: 3725
  time: '1:02:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Cool. That was really super interesting. I've been around for quite
    a bit, but I've learned a lot. I hope this was interesting to the community. Thanks,
    everyone, for submitting your questions and for participating. Next time, you
    will see Alexey again in the host chair, and maybe behind the scenes, probably.
