transcript:
- line: "This week we will talk about the disconnection between data folks and the\
    \ management, and how to bridge the gap between the two. We have a special guest\
    \ today \u2014 Lior. Lior has experience of over 12 years in building data teams,\
    \ leveraging data for growth. He learned a lot from that, he experienced a lot\
    \ of pains and he even has written a book about this. He also hosts a podcast\
    \ \u2014 \u201CWhat the Data?!\u201D and \u2014 full disclosure \u2014 I was a\
    \ guest on this podcast once, so go and check it out. Welcome to our event!"

    talking to data scientists and data engineers. We can do so many cool things together.
    I am happy to be here!

- line: "Welcome. Before we go into our main topic of communicating with business,\
    \ let\u2019s talk a bit about your background. With 12 years of experience you\
    \ probably saw a lot of things. Can you tell us a bit about your career journey\
    \ so far?"
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I am a dinosaur as we call it. I started my data career even before there\
    \ was any Google analytics on board. We used analytics tools that were installed\
    \ locally by us. In the last couple of years, I was working for Zalando. There\
    \ basically I did the entire transformation of the data for the marketing department.\
    \ I was working for Lovoo, a dating app. To the ones who do not know it, it\u2019\
    s a quite cool company. There I was a project manager / product manager to help\
    \ constructing data."

  time: '2:49'
  who: Lior
- line: "Now lately I am running the podcast \u201CWHAT the Data?!\u201D where I am\
    \ interviewing data and business people. I\u2019m trying to bridge the communication\
    \ between these two functions to leverage the data for growth. Then also I am\
    \ managing director of \u201CTale about Data\u201D, which is a company that we\
    \ started as an agency. Now we are moving more towards a product approach. We\
    \ help companies to set up their data infrastructure in a quick way, so they can\
    \ focus on hiring good data engineers and not being under pressure to run around."
  who: Lior
- header: Who is a data strategist?
- line: "I checked your LinkedIn profile and it says that your title now is a \u201C\
    data strategist\u201D. This makes me wonder what does a data strategist do?"
  sec: 248
  time: '4:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: A data strategist is the person who sits between the data engineering, the
    data science and the business, trying to find the right approach to use the data.
    One of the biggest pains that I suffered as a product manager for data for a very
    long time was that I need a dashboard. I need it now. I need it tomorrow, the
    calculation is wrong, I do not trust it. It is supposed to be eight, why is it
    four? What a data strategist needs to do? It needs to balance between the two
    functions of the tech and the business, ensure that both of them are speaking
    the right language.
  sec: 261
  time: '4:21'
  who: Lior
- line: "The second part: they also have the right strategy. They are actually understanding\
    \ when we are talking about installs \u2014  what do we mean when we are saying\
    \ \u201Cinstall\u201D? What do we mean when we are talking about sessions. When\
    \ we are running a model for forecasting the revenue, how is it being calculated?"
  who: Lior
- line: "The business is not going to go into the details of \u201Cis it a random\
    \ forest or a linear regression\u201D? They will ask, but they are not really\
    \ understanding what is behind it. What they care about is how accurate it is.\
    \ This is where you need to come in and actually make sure that the understanding\
    \ level is correct between everybody."
  who: Lior
- line: There is also a trust to the data. A lot of business people do not trust the
    data. This is something I always suffered from. I know it cannot be the data is
    correct, check it again, I am missing something here. This is where that strategist
    should come in and support the organization in understanding better how to use
    it.
  who: Lior
- line: 'As understood, you do two things. One: you are the bridge between the technical
    people and the business people. You help communicate, you translate the requirements
    maybe and develop trust for business. Business people do not trust the data. You
    help them to have this trust. You help them understand what is going on behind
    the hood. Then, at the same time, you also probably do that the other way around?
    You help the technical people to understand what business wants from them, right?'
  sec: 355
  time: '5:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I like to say that I am the idiot in the room that asks all the idiotic\
    \ questions that everybody else is afraid to ask. That is how I see it myself\
    \ \u2014 if I need to sum it up."
  sec: 396
  time: '6:36'
  who: Lior
- line: As I understood, you are coming from the product management background. So
    you are more from the business side coming into tech rather than from tech to
    the business side?
  sec: 408
  time: '6:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually I started my way in the tech. I was in the path of being a developer.
    Then I decided that life is too short for me to sit down and debug code. This
    was always one of my biggest frustrations. Then I moved more towards product,
    but I am still coding. I am still writing Python. I know SQL is not a code, but
    I am still writing SQL queries. I am still running R-queries, sometimes using
    R for different parts. So, I am still connected to the code. But I am trying not
    to develop because I know I am bad at it. But I understand enough code to be able
    to translate it into something that people can understand. Or I can at least look
    at it and see what is going on in there.
  sec: 419
  time: '6:59'
  who: Lior
- header: Improving communication between business and tech
- line: "So, you have the background of a technical person, you also have a background\
    \ of a product manager which puts you in this unique position of being able to\
    \ understand both \u2014 be able to translate from one world to another, from\
    \ one function to another. From your point of view, how can we improve communication\
    \ between the technical side and the business side? What are the things we can\
    \ do to make it better, smoother?"
  sec: 466
  time: '7:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: "One of the most idiotic things that I noticed when improving communication.\
    \ When something goes wrong with the data or with the formula, send a small email\
    \ and say \u201CGuys do not use it. We are checking what went wrong\u201D. Even\
    \ if it was triggered automatically. Try to trigger it automatically before people\
    \ even start using the data. In today's world, we are trying to finish processes\
    \ before people arrive to the office. We do not have any office anymore, we are\
    \ all sitting at home, but we are trying to make it available for people from\
    \ around 8:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m. \u2014 whatever. You are setting it\
    \ up, people are expecting to have the data at this point. One of the key components\
    \ here \u2014 especially when we are talking about creating trust \u2014 is to\
    \ trigger this small email saying \u201CEverything was working fine. You can use\
    \ the data\u201D or \u201CThere was an issue. Do not use the data. It may cause\
    \ you to make the wrong decisions\u201D. Once somebody starts to suspect your\
    \ data, you lost this trust. To buy it again, it will take you a long time. Longer\
    \ than what you even expect. It is just creating more frustration, it is just\
    \ causing more backlogs on you as a developer."
  sec: 502
  time: '8:22'
  who: Lior
- line: "In the long run you are going to find yourself running into an issue of \u201C\
    They do not trust me\u201D. I do my job. I am frustrated with my job. The data\
    \ scientist and all the data engineers become very frustrated. This is something\
    \ I noticed and I was not aware of it. Because for me, at the beginning when I\
    \ started, I was like \u201COkay, there is a request. You need to make it happen.\
    \ I do not care how it happens. It needs to happen\u201D. But very quickly I realized\
    \ that a lot of these requests are coming from frustration \u2014 from the business\
    \ person who is transferring it now to the technical guy, who could have solved\
    \ it just by sending an email saying \u201CListen, dude. I checked the data, everything\
    \ is looking good. If you have complaints we can check it, but there is no reason\
    \ for you, because I did the QA for you. I checked that the data is correct. Is\
    \ to the best of my knowledge. If you spotted something, I would be more than\
    \ happy to have a conversation about it\u201D. It is going to reduce 60 percent\
    \ of the wasting of the time back and forth between the tech and the business\
    \ in many cases."
  who: Lior
- header: Building trust
- line: "So the main thing here is building trust. Business people need to have trust\
    \ in the work of data engineers, data analysts, and data scientists. One of the\
    \ ways of doing this is to be upfront, be transparent. If something happens, inform\
    \ immediately. \u201CHey our job failed, so today expect some inconsistency in\
    \ the data, we are working on fixing this. Sorry about that.\u201D"
  sec: 648
  time: '10:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Think about something else. You have a forecast model. You are running it\
    \ on a database that is supposed to forecast revenues. You need to forecast 30\
    \ days ahead or even 360 days ahead. If you are showing a certain number there,\
    \ people do not trust the number you give them. How can you make them trust? Either\
    \ you are creating some graph that is showing them what your confidence level\
    \ in the information is. Either you telling them \u201CThis is based on the most\
    \ accurate data I have right now. This is what I am predicting\u201D. In many\
    \ cases, when I worked on forecasting models, suddenly a model was crashing. It\
    \ used to be very stable on a certain level. And then one day it crashed. Sometimes\
    \ marketing changed their campaigns or stopped them. And the entire model went\
    \ to the garbage \u2014 because it was counting on a certain traffic that is going\
    \ to happen."
  sec: 678
  time: '11:18'
  who: Lior
- line: "In some other cases, the model is not relevant anymore. Because somehow the\
    \ users that arrive completely changed the picture of how it is observing the\
    \ operation. Or some features were changing. They are not relevant anymore, they\
    \ are not available anymore. This is the way for the data scientist to create\
    \ a small dashboard and put it somewhere. Whenever people are suspecting that\
    \ the number is wrong, they can go there. They can QA it quickly and see immediately\
    \ if there is a problem or not. This is really small stuff that will take us half\
    \ an hour, one hour, and two hours to do. And it can increase the trust of people\
    \ \u2014 just because they have access to the data now, to the back end. They\
    \ know how the calculation is going. They will be able to already see if something\
    \ went wrong or not. Your job is to build a model but also to create in a certain\
    \ way."
  who: Lior
- line: "You mentioned that to build good communication, we need to build trust. Building\
    \ trust is informing and being transparent. The second thing is showing small\
    \ things like confidence intervals. Being upfront that our model might be wrong\
    \ and these are potential boundaries and all that. Is there something else that\
    \ we should do? I think for good communication there should be somebody who can\
    \ speak the language. In addition to tools, in addition to all this alerting,\
    \ we need to have somebody who can do this \u2014 you can call it \u201Cthe data\
    \ strategist or\u201D I think. Usually it can be a product manager who was previously\
    \ technical. Or maybe a data scientist who is doing more the product way. But\
    \ somebody needs to be this translator."

  time: '13:15'
  who: Alexey
- header: Putting data and business people together
- line: "Not necessarily. You can have this translator in the middle. But you, as\
    \ somebody who is touching the data \u2014 and basically most of us \u2014 most\
    \ of the data engineers, data scientists are looking at themselves as an enabler's\
    \ functions. I am enabling somebody to do his job, so he can do something better.\
    \ The reality is that without you understanding what the product manager, or the\
    \ marketing, or the finance team, or any other team out there wants to achieve,\
    \ you would not be able to do your job as good as you want. That\u2019s one of\
    \ the things that I noticed many times \u2014 the communication is always going\
    \ either above somebody's head or is going around it. And we are trying to avoid\
    \ it because I am talking tech and I will explain the tech side, and he is talking\
    \ business, he is going to explain the business side. But this is not true."
  sec: 860
  time: '14:20'
  who: Lior
- line: "When I was working with data people, I put the data people \u2014 the data\
    \ engineers, the analysts or even the data scientists \u2014 to sit with the business\
    \ for a day or two. So they can see what they are doing. If you are looking for\
    \ transparency in how you are writing the code, and how you are creating it, notifying\
    \ people, it is a great thing that saves a lot of time for everybody and increases\
    \ the trust. QAing the data is a great thing that is also creating an advantage.\
    \ But sitting with the people that are going to use your data at the end, understand\
    \ their problems and what they do \u2014 it\u2019s going to help you to communicate\
    \ with them better. You can tell them \u201CListen, I was sitting with you, I\
    \ saw that you are doing X, Y and Z. This is why I change my process to adapt\
    \ it better to what you do\u201D. Or maybe something is wrong. Let\u2019s try\
    \ a different approach. It doesn\u2019t always go through a third party."
  who: Lior
- line: "There is one function as I see it \u2014  that is the grow function. It\u2019\
    s built with the tech side and the business side. Both of them should enrich each\
    \ other and give the ability to grow and learn new stuff. The business can come\
    \ with new ideas of automation or how to improve the models. The data side should\
    \ come to the business and tell them \u201CListen, I see that you are doing this\
    \ in these operations usually. Why don\u2019t we change it? Why don\u2019t we\
    \ do it better?\u201D For example, the most stupid thing that I saw was \u2014\
    \ somebody was having five to six clicks to change his bidding on a certain platform.\
    \ The data engineer who was sitting with them was like \u201CHold on, but why\
    \ do you do this? There is an API. I can write it for you. I can throw you a front\
    \ end, it is going to take me a week to build an MVP for you. You don\u2019t need\
    \ to do all of these clicks around. You just can optimize it from one place.\u201D\
    \ It came only from the fact that they were sitting one next to each other and\
    \ communicated on a level \u201CI showed you what I am doing and I will show you\
    \ what I can do for you afterwards.\u201D"
  who: Lior
- line: "I can totally relate to this as a data scientist. I remember that once I\
    \ worked in a team that was creating tools for moderators. Moderators are people\
    \ who look at\u2026 In my case, I work at OLX. This is a company where you can\
    \ sell things. There are people who actually look at the content that users produce\
    \ \u2014 at the listings that people produce. They see \u201COkay, this is something\
    \ that should not go live on the platform\u201D. They reject it, they remove it\
    \ from the platform. We were building things for these moderators. I remember\
    \ for me the most enlightening experience was actually talking to the moderators,\
    \ watching them how they work, working with them together and using the system\
    \ together with them to moderate content. So, just sitting with the users, with\
    \ those people who are going to consume the data products, consume the machine\
    \ learning services. I can totally agree that it brings understanding on the next\
    \ level. And this experience that you see, what kind of problems they have, it\
    \ gives you a different perspective."

- line: "And to remember that data is not an enabling function, it\u2019s a leading\
    \ function. Without having the right data, having the right outcome of the data,\
    \ nobody will be able to do anything. It is not only enabling, it is also growing.\
    \ It\u2019s part of the growth of the organization. I was working as a freelancer\
    \ for a while for cisco in the recruitment team. one of the most important parts\
    \ for the recruitment team was the recruitment process. To analyze it and to understand\
    \ which positions were issues or not, or which positions can be improved with\
    \ the candidate. Maybe we are missing something that we do not see today?"
  sec: 1130

  who: Lior
- line: "You can only drive this stuff when you are sitting with the recruiter together,\
    \ you are understanding how he is working. The same thing goes to marketing and\
    \ the same thing goes to every place. A lot of these recruiters are also frustrated\
    \ many times with their job \u2014 there is a hiring manager that is stuck in\
    \ the process. Maybe you can create some panel of some dashboard for them that\
    \ they can go and say \u201COkay, you are stuck in my process. Let\u2019s see\
    \ how we can move faster, how we can improve the process and bring better candidates\u201D\
    . Or if candidates feel that they are suffering, how can you actually improve\

    \ six clicks, the data engineer approached and said \u201CHey, we can make it\
    \ easier for you\u201D. But I imagine that there are some cases when the data\
    \ engineer would have a pushback. Maybe in cases when there is not enough trust\
    \ between the technical part and the business part. Then they think \u201CThis\
    \ is somebody coming from outside who is telling us how to do things. No. We will\
    \ keep doing things the old way\u201D How to deal with these pushbacks? When you\

    \ free time. And then present it and tell him \u201CYou can keep doing your own\
    \ stuff, but let\u2019s give this one a try for a week or week and half and see\

    \ it for a week. There is no chance that they are going to push it back. I think\
    \ yes, there are a lot of pushbacks for tech people. \u201CNo, don\u2019t do that.\
    \ I have a bigger strategy that I need you to work on.\u201D But right now I see\
    \ that there is a problem that I can solve quite quickly, so why don\u2019t you\
    \ let me work on it for a week? We are going to have a setback of a week. A lot\
    \ of companies are working with OKRs and stuff like this. Okay, so you are going\
    \ to reach 0.5 instead of 0.7 because you had an extra week working on something\
    \ else. But it saved you the amount of time that you saved. This is what actually\

    \ job is just to download reports from different platforms. They do copy-paste\

    \ time. It\u2019s 14 employees that work an entire month or half of the month\
    \ just on downloading data. No organization is going to come and tell you \u201C\
    What? No, that is a stupid idea to automate it. Why would we do it?\u201D On the\
    \ contrary, the organization wants to automate this process. Then these employees\
    \ can do their actual job which is not sitting there and downloading reports,\
    \ but going over the data, make the right decision, change the biddings, change\
    \ the right approach for growth. Their job is not to download the data and just\
    \ copy paste it into excel. This is where we are coming into the picture. We should\
    \ push quite hard and find our right way to present stuff."

    \ I will add here: don\u2019t get complicated with stuff. Don\u2019t go into development\
    \ for three months or six months for a product. In the industry that we are working\
    \ in, sometimes three or six months means the end cycle of a feature of a product.\

    \ what can I achieve in a week, a week and a half or maximum two weeks. I can\

    \ building it. Start with a lean approach, then move into an agile approach. This\

    \ is no one system that fits everybody. But we need to think about it as a cycle.\

    garden. I am starting it from the seed. It is slowly growing and I need to move
    it into a new pot. When it is in this pot, I need to let it grow there and I need
    to move it to another pot. I am starting in February and only in May or June,
    I am going to put it into the ground. It is going to catch with the roots into
    the soil itself. But until I am arriving at this point, I need to have different
    approaches to the plant. When I am seeding it, I need to make sure it is dark
    and moist for it. When it is opening up and the leaves are coming out, I already
    need to change my approach and start growing it in a different way.

    \ so simple and so fast. This is how data should be. This is how people should\
    \ actually think about their approach to that. It should be simple but it is filling\
    \ you up so much that you do not want to eat anything else afterwards. It is that\

    \ it costs and we are going to make a decision.\u201D What is the difference between\
    \ Tableau and AWS QuickSight? They don\u2019t have this feeling. In my book, what\
    \ I want to say is \u201CGuys, it\u2019s really simple. If you are going to cook\
    \ it correctly and you are going to follow the orders, you can create a great\
    \ experience\u201D. This where I am coming from, trying to bridge these two different\

    \ goes somewhere there. The tech is somehow involved. But the problem is that\
    \ the business is creating a lot of pressure on the tech side. What I am trying\
    \ to do in my book \u2014 I am talking about forming the data strategy. How do\
    \ you actually understand what is important and what is not? Where should you\
    \ put your emphasis on? As a data engineer, as a data scientist \u2014 is it on\
    \ the models or is it on APIs, and cleaning the data and sorting it? The only\
    \ way to achieve it is by getting the people into the understanding of \u201C\
    There is a process. Let\u2019s try to create a flow where we all agree on what\
    \ we are doing, what is important and what is not.\u201D Then slowly we are going\
    \ to increase it. But first, let\u2019s feel comfortable with what we do. Let\u2019\
    s create the base. Then, on top of it, we can beat whatever we want. This is my\
    \ main philosophy in life: start with something simple and stable and then build\
    \ on top of it. Whatever. Models, breakouts, call it whatever you want."

    \ hummus\u201D. They don\u2019t like it. They prefer to go someplace else. It\u2019\
