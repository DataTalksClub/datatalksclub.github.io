short: Lessons Learned from Freelancing and Working in a Start-up
title: Lessons Learned from Freelancing and Working in a Start-up
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about freelancing and working at a startup. We have
    a special guest today, Antonis. Antonis is a freelance data scientist who is currently
    working at Nanometrisis, which is a startup that focuses on providing software
    for nanoproducts inspection. That sounds really cool. In addition, he recently
    joined a freelance platform called Upwork, where he offers a range of data solutions
    to clients. Welcome to the show.
  sec: 92
  time: '1:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: Hi. Thank you for your invitation. Nice to be here.
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Antonis
- line: Yeah. And what I did not have in the script, but Antonis is actually a very,
    very active member of the DataTalks.Club community and it's a real pleasure for
    me to have him here today. So thanks for joining us today. The questions for today's
    interview are, as always, prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks a lot, Johanna, for
    your help.
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Alexey
- header: Antonis' background
- line: Before we go into our main topic of freelancing and working at a startup,
    let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your journey so far?
  sec: 148
  time: '2:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I will start with my Bachelor's. I studied applied mathematics and physics.
    That's my main degree. Actually, I also focused in the physics direction, so I
    graduated as a physicist. Then I continued to do a Master's in Greece – so a Master's
    and Bachelor's in Greece. That was on nanotechnology. There, while I was doing
    my thesis, which was around 2017, I started working with data science. It was
    because of my thesis.
  sec: 158
  time: '2:38'
  who: Antonis
- line: After that, I went to the Netherlands to join a program that's called a professional
    doctorate in engineering. For this program, you work for a university, which sends
    you to do projects with companies around the Netherlands. So you do this project,
    you get exposure to industry, and you also get modules and training from the university.
    So it's a kind of a combination of [cross-talk]
  sec: 158
  time: '2:38'
  who: Antonis
- line: As a part of your education?
  sec: 227
  time: '3:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's education and work in the same program. The first year you work
    as a kind of a consultant for a company, doing small projects, for like four or
    three months. Then in the second year, they send you to do a one-year contract
    with a company. You work there, you provide your solution to their problem and
    you also get the training. You need a specialist from the university. After that,
    I became a freelancer in Greece, after I came back to Greece. My first job was
    actually the reason why I came back to Greece, which was for the startup called
    Nanometrisis. As you said, what we do is build software for companies who are
    building nanoproducts. We help them inspect those, because there is a lot of complexity
    there.
  sec: 230
  time: '3:50'
  who: Antonis
- line: If somebody doesn't want to invest their money or the time or a team on finding
    these metrics that characterize nanoproducts structure, since it's very complicated
    – if somebody doesn't want to do that, we offer them our software, which can lift
    this kind of burden off their shoulders. While I was doing that, because I was
    technically a freelancer in Greece, I joined the Upwork platform, which is for
    freelancers ,where I provided solutions for machine learning data science. That's
    what's happening right now.
  sec: 230
  time: '3:50'
  who: Antonis
- line: That's a cool journey. So what are those nanoproducts? Is it related to electronics,
    like phones and stuff?
  sec: 327
  time: '5:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Actually, one of the nanoproducts (or clients) that we have is building
    surfaces in the nanoscale. You can't see it with your eyes – you need a special
    machine to see them using electrons. So it uses electrons and not light. These
    surfaces are the base for the chips that we use in our phones and in our laptops.
    Also, apart from that, there are some edges, like those we have for razors.
  sec: 335
  time: '5:35'
  who: Antonis
- line: Even the edges of the razors have to  have very specific roughness on them
    so they can be effective and cut only the hair. Then there are also nanoparticles,
    which can be on the creams that we put on our face, for example. So it has to
    have specific sizes. So there's a big variety of nanoproducts and it's still growing.
  sec: 335
  time: '5:35'
  who: Antonis
- line: I only knew about the chips part. But I had an idea about razors and nanoparticles.
    That's pretty interesting. I never realized that razors are such a complex thing.
    I always saw them as just a sharp thing that you use to cut hair. [chuckles]
  sec: 399
  time: '6:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's very complicated and there is a lot of science behind it.
  sec: 418
  time: '6:58'
  who: Antonis
- line: I know that Phillips (the razor I use) is a big company in the Netherlands.
    Did you get an exposure to these things at Phillips? Did you work at Phillips
    in any way?
  sec: 425
  time: '7:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. Not in Philips. Other people did. I had other companies like [inaudible],
    which also like a spin-off from Philips. But they were people who did projects
    with Philips.
  sec: 440
  time: '7:20'
  who: Antonis
- line: I heard about programs like the one you had, and usually Philips invests a
    lot of money into these kinds of things. I think one of the universities... Did
    you study at Eindhoven University?
  sec: 460
  time: '7:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. Yeah, in Eindhoven. Actually, it is from Eindhoven and it's also a joint
    program from Delft... and I don't remember the other company.
  sec: 472
  time: '7:52'
  who: Antonis
- header: The pros and cons of working for a startup
- line: Anyways, you finished your program, you came back to Greece, and you decided
    to work at a startup. So how did it happen? Why a startup? Why not join a corporation?
  sec: 487
  time: '8:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I had an opportunity to either work for a corporation (kind of a corporation,
    it was the SNC company). I had the opportunity either to work there or to work
    at the startup. Both offers were around the same time. After I graduated, I finished
    the program and had a lot of time. I was doing interviews, and I had rejections
    throughout the process. Then had those two offers at the same time. So I was thinking
    in my head, “Okay, what do I want?” I had to stop and think for many days. I decided
    that I would like to try.
  sec: 499
  time: '8:19'
  who: Antonis
- line: I was admiring the entrepreneurship journey in creating something innovative
    and boosting the market and seeing how it goes, getting feedback – all these parts
    of the startup. I always admired startup stories. So I said, “Okay, I'm gonna
    do it now. If something doesn't go well, maybe I will have other opportunities
    to go to a corporation.” Also by the way, the startup was doing what I was doing
    for the Master's and I would do something in data science, which I don't think
    would be very easy.
  sec: 499
  time: '8:19'
  who: Antonis
- line: So in your Master's, you were doing some nanoproduct stuff already? [Antonis
    agrees] Okay. So it was quite related. You were interested in these nanoproducts,
    you were interested in data science, and it was two of those things together.
  sec: 594
  time: '9:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, yeah.
  sec: 616
  time: '10:16'
  who: Antonis
- line: Okay. That's pretty interesting. When you were deciding between a startup
    and a corporation, I think there were probably also some good things about joining
    a corporation, right? Did you do some sort of comparison? For example, when I
    need to make a decision, sometimes what I do is list the pros and cons and then
    I see “Okay, there are more pros here than cons.” And then that's the decision
    I make. Did you do something like this when deciding?
  sec: 619
  time: '10:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I did it exactly like that. I also didn't tell anyone about this.
    So I cut off everyone's opinion that may have affected my decision. It was just
    me and myself, let's say, and I was trying to balance the pros and cons. You definitely
    get some pros from working for a corporation and some cons as well. Eventually
    I said, “Let's try the startup direction.” I thought they would give me some more
    value. In the future, I will go back to the corporate environment and get something
    there.
  sec: 648
  time: '10:48'
  who: Antonis
- line: Or maybe the startup will become a corporation.
  sec: 690
  time: '11:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, yeah. That would also be a good outcome. [chuckles]
  sec: 692
  time: '11:32'
  who: Antonis
- line: '[chuckles] Okay. Do you remember what the pros and cons were? For pros regarding
    working for a startup, I think you mentioned creating something innovative and
    other things. Do you remember, what were the other things you put when deciding?'
  sec: 699
  time: '11:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think when it comes to a corporate environment, although there are
    always exceptions, you're kind of more focused on the job that is in the role
    description. But in a startup, you might take other positions as well, because
    there are not so many people. You may have to talk to clients or you may have
    to do the branding, meaning you have to make a video about your company. There
    are so many things that might have been somebody else's job in a corporate environment.
    I think that some people can consider this a con and others may think it's a pro,
    depending on what they like to do.
  sec: 716
  time: '11:56'
  who: Antonis
- line: For you, was it a pro or a con?
  sec: 772
  time: '12:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: For me, it was kind of a pro. I wanted to have the ability to go a bit into
    the business so part of it as well, or other aspects of it – to control them.
  sec: 773
  time: '12:53'
  who: Antonis
- line: Do you actually need to record videos now?
  sec: 788
  time: '13:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, I haven't. But I built a website. Some people in my company have made
    videos – recorded them and posted them, for branding. I also think another pro
    thing that I want to have in a startup is to be more organized by nature – that
    is, you have to be more organized in a corporate environment. In a startup, you
    have to do that yourself.
  sec: 791
  time: '13:11'
  who: Antonis
- line: Maybe it has to do with accountability as well. You yourself are accountable
    for that, while in a company, it's easier to be somebody else – you have deadlines
    from your manager or your team, but with a startup you set your deadlines yourself
    or maybe your clients do. It depends. That would be something different as well.
  sec: 791
  time: '13:11'
  who: Antonis
- line: How large is the company where you work? How many people work there?
  sec: 863
  time: '14:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: We are four active people.
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Antonis
- line: Four. Okay. That's a pretty small startup.
  sec: 874
  time: '14:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [chuckles] I don't know. I've seen startups with two people. [chuckles]
  sec: 879
  time: '14:39'
  who: Antonis
- line: Well, there are startups with one person, right?
  sec: 886
  time: '14:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's true. In the accelerator that we have, there were some that were
    just one person building cool things.
  sec: 889
  time: '14:49'
  who: Antonis
- line: So four people. If you're one of these four, you have to do pretty much everything,
    right?
  sec: 901
  time: '15:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Now we were in an accelerator and were getting a lot of business. We
    were developing a business acumen, let's say, because we were coming from an academic
    mindset. Nanometrisis started as a spin-off from a research center in Greece.
    So I had to get this kind of knowledge and learn how to translate it to the company.
  sec: 907
  time: '15:07'
  who: Antonis
- header: Useful skills for working at a startup and the Lean way to work
- line: Since you joined, what kind of new skills have you learned working at a startup?
  sec: 941
  time: '15:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think communication – how to be better at communicating with the team. Because
    I was not the only data scientist. When I was building something, I had to translate
    it using not too many complicated, technical words to other people. Also, maybe
    to some clients, or managers, or CEOs and other clients. So communication skills,
    definitely. This was just an example. Another thing for me was business knowledge.
    I'm still learning. I have a ways to go. Because, again, I am accountable for
    myself and for the client.
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Antonis
- line: I have to increase the quality of my product. My code still is not on the
    level that I want, but I'm working on it. There's a lot of learning. You have
    to be able to learn things on your own. The other thing that I was talking about,
    and I posted a blog about it – being lean. That was a big thing for me. The lean
    way to work.
  sec: 949
  time: '15:49'
  who: Antonis
- line: What is a lean way to work?
  sec: 1056
  time: '17:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: It comes from the fact that we cannot make very accurate predictions of something
    that we will publish, or how it will go. So we build the product and that product
    is built on assumptions. If it's physics or maybe you want to send something to
    space, I know it's very complicated, but the rules can be predictable. There are
    masses and you can write some things in the notes and predict where it will go
    in space within the next second, for example. Of course, it's complicated and
    has other parts as well. When you launch a product, or even a new remodel, you
    have to do this based on assumptions. And you have to test – that's the thing,
    you have to test them as soon as possible. From the test, you get feedback – this
    thing worked and this thing didn't work.
  sec: 1059
  time: '17:39'
  who: Antonis
- line: I made the prediction that my site that sells cars – I'm trying to push more
    red cars to sell them, because I think people like red cars more. I have to test
    this. This is my best idea right now – my innovative idea. I try it out, it doesn't
    work, so I have to pivot and try to do something different. This is the lean way.
    It's based on the circle, where you build something, you measure it, you learn
    from it, and then you build again and you do this in a loop. Again, you cannot
    know and you cannot predict everything.
  sec: 1059
  time: '17:39'
  who: Antonis
- line: So there is an idea and you think that this idea is going to work. You need
    to find a way to test this idea, right? And then you need to have a way to measure
    the effect of this idea. For example, “Do people really buy more cars if we have
    more red cars?” Something like that. Then you see “Okay, indeed. People buy more.”
    Or nothing changes. This gives you some idea of what happened so you can either
    change your assumptions or maybe develop them. Is that right?
  sec: 1175
  time: '19:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You develop them further. I used a startup example, but it definitely
    goes well with a machine learning process or a data product.
  sec: 1205
  time: '20:05'
  who: Antonis
- line: It seems like something that will work in other environments too, not just
    at startups – corporations too.
  sec: 1225
  time: '20:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think in the end, that's something that they do. Actually, even the
    book that I was reading about this – The Lean Startup – it said in the beginning,
    that this is not only for startups. It's for everyone. For companies...
  sec: 1234
  time: '20:34'
  who: Antonis
- line: For life?
  sec: 1259
  time: '20:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: I mean, yeah. Maybe life. [chuckles] In machine learning, you make assumptions
    when you publish a model about how it will go based on the training dataset that
    you have in the testing. But then when you publish it, things might change. One
    aspect that people are seeing and discussing a lot right now – you have it in
    MLOps course – is the monitoring. There, things drift. You have data drift or
    concept drift and you have to monitor them to see whether your model or the assumptions
    change. You have tools like Evidently AI that can definitely be useful to have.
  sec: 1260
  time: '21:00'
  who: Antonis
- header: How Antonis joined the DataTalks.Club community
- line: For those who do not know, Antonis is talking about the MLOps course, which
    is the free course that started last week. We are still on module one and by the
    time the recording is out, we will probably be on module three, maybe. You can
    check it out. I think there should be a link in the description to this video,
    too.
  sec: 1314
  time: '21:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: I actually wanted to talk to you about that a little bit later, but before
    starting the stream, I asked you when you joined DataTalks.Club, so maybe you
    can tell us a bit more about that. You're a very active member of our community
    and it's very interesting to hear your story. How did it happen that you joined
    our community?
  sec: 1314
  time: '21:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: All right. I had a friend who was also in the program in Eindhoven, Lena.
    We were talking about courses and discussing them. I was telling him, “Hey, I
    want to check out more courses because I think I'm weak on some topics.” And he
    said, “I know Alexey from DataTalks.Club. You can check it out.” Back then I think
    it was December, he was telling me that you had the data engineering course. I
    was like, “Okay, yeah. I'll check it out.” I was a bit late to join, so I didn't
    join the data engineering course that you had. I also didn't know about the concept
    of your Slack or the talks that you had. I wasn't sure what it was. As the months
    passed, I was seeing the talks that you had – the interviews – and I was checking
    out the Slack more often. I slowly kind of understood what was happening in Slack
    and the whole community, so I said, “Okay, I will join the MLOps course when there
    is a chance.”
  sec: 1360
  time: '22:40'
  who: Antonis
- line: I really liked it. I definitely liked the fact that people were posting questions
    or talking about MLOps. It was something that I realized that we didn't have when
    I first came to my startup. I was actually the only data scientist there, kind
    of. It was fascinating to see people from around the world talking about data
    and some new things that are happening. I also learned something new. After that,
    I wanted to be more active. I saw that apart from being in the community, maybe
    I could do something of my own, like you suggested, the project of the week.
  sec: 1360
  time: '22:40'
  who: Antonis
- line: Yeah, it's really cool to have you here. It's nice to hear your story. So
    you tried to do the data engineering course, but it was a bit late. But you did
    the MLOps one, right?
  sec: 1492
  time: '24:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That was my first one.
  sec: 1506
  time: '25:06'
  who: Antonis
- line: Do you remember what your project was about?
  sec: 1508
  time: '25:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I chose a semiconductor project. [chuckles] I don't remember what I
    was predicting. There were a lot of features. It was a machine learning model
    that I think was predicting if a chip is going to fail or not. I'm not sure. I
    had the opportunity to use MLflow. I hadn't used it in the past. I checked out
    Grafana with Evidently AI. And I also used Prefect. It was a very nice alternative
    for me, personally, to Airflow. For me and for the things I wanted to build, it
    was much easier. I had an opportunity to use all of them together, kind of as
    you did  in the course. It was a great learning experience. Having a project definitely
    was the best thing in the end for getting the knowledge installed in your head.
  sec: 1512
  time: '25:12'
  who: Antonis
- header: Suggestions for students joining the MLOps course
- line: Do you have any suggestions for the students who just started the MLOps course?
  sec: 1598
  time: '26:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think I would definitely suggest doing the exercises in the end. You
    can watch a video and then you can forget what was done in it if you don't practice
    it yourself. For me, that happens all the time. I think I know it, but the knowledge
    part is different from the skill set. Those things are different. Also, have patience.
    I know, everybody might be very busy, but if you have patience and slowly progress
    every day whenever you have time, you can certainly make it. DataTalks is very
    flexible on the deadline. Sometimes I felt really pressured on the deadline, but
    you extended it by one week. I don't know if I should say that really. [chuckles]
  sec: 1603
  time: '26:43'
  who: Antonis
- line: Another thing is to definitely do the final project. Again, as I said before,
    that was the best thing. Another thing that I didn't mention, where the community
    helped me – you mention a lot about posting your progress in public or making
    a post. I couldn't post every day, but I was seeing other people doing that, which
    looked nice. But I posted my final project and I had a lot of requests – people
    sending me messages to discuss it. So I really liked that as well. People had
    questions about my project. [chuckles] That was very rewarding as well.
  sec: 1603
  time: '26:43'
  who: Antonis
- header: Antonis contributing to Evidently AI
- line: That's pretty cool. I know that in the course you used Evidently and then
    I saw you in the Evidently community. I think you also contributed to the tool.
    How did that happen? Can you tell us about that?
  sec: 1711
  time: '28:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I saw Evidently and I liked the tool. Then they announced the Hacktoberfest
    for October. The organization behind it announced it and Evidently itself had
    some issues posted, where you could do a pull request. I like them too, and I
    like the whole aspect of it. It fits, as I said before, in my lean aspect of the
    startup. I said, “Well, let's try it out.” I wasn't sure that I could do something
    useful, but it's something that I'm trying to follow. Again, I like the community
    there very much – the people, definitely. I'm learning a lot from that as well.
  sec: 1723
  time: '28:43'
  who: Antonis
- line: Are you still contributing?
  sec: 1791
  time: '29:51'
  who: Antonis
- line: I try to. Yeah. It was a small contribution on a notebook. It was a how-to,
    as a tutorial mostly. I don't have a lot of time, but when I do, I try to add
    to it.
  sec: 1793
  time: '29:53'
  who: Antonis
- header: How Antonis started freelancing
- line: Well, speaking of not having so much time – I know that you work at a startup
    and that you also take a very active part in our community. You also contribute
    to open source projects, like with Evidently, and you also freelance. So tell
    us about that part – how did you start freelancing and what do you do now as a
    freelancer?
  sec: 1813
  time: '30:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I was working at a startup and I wanted to expose myself more to data
    science and building things. Apart from gaining the knowledge I also wanted some
    actual clients for myself, for the data science part, just for me to grow and
    earn some extra income, if I could. I found this platform called Upwork. It's
    a platform that allows freelancers – it could be data scientists and machine learning
    engineers, but it could also be something like web designers. So it's not only
    for data people.
  sec: 1833
  time: '30:33'
  who: Antonis
- line: The platform offers freelancers a spot and also offers a spot for clients.
    Clients post their job and freelancers see those jobs – they apply all together
    and see if the client says, “Okay, I like you. Let's do an interview. Okay, you
    fit. Let's start the project.” The project could be fixed price or hourly. There's
    a lot of competition, but it's a very nice platform.
  sec: 1833
  time: '30:33'
  who: Antonis
- line: What kind of projects are there usually? Long projects, short projects?
  sec: 1912
  time: '31:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: All kinds. I have a niche – you can check out my dissertation over two hours
    or something, and there could be a six month project on building a model. Now
    I see a lot of LLMs there – GPT-related things.
  sec: 1917
  time: '31:57'
  who: Antonis
- line: What kind of projects do you usually go after?
  sec: 1946
  time: '32:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: Machine learning, data science, analytics – those three. There are a lot of
    those and very diverse – it could  be from healthcare, for example. I had a big
    one from there. It was a kind of text mining. There was one, again, to build a
    segmentation model. I also had one recently.
  sec: 1950
  time: '32:30'
  who: Antonis
- line: From what I hear, it's more short-term projects – maybe for a week or a month.
    Something like that?
  sec: 1983
  time: '33:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Actually, the healthcare project was for three months. The segmentation one
    that I did was three weeks. I had another one that was very short. But it depends.
    I couldn't join a very, very long, long one, because I had the startup journey,
    so I was doing short-term projects. You can choose to put in more than 40 hours
    per week if you want. You can filter the jobs. But there are long term ones. I
    just happened to choose certain ones because of the time I can put in.

- header: Getting your first clients on Upwork
- line: You mentioned that there is a lot of competition. I imagined that especially
    for those who are just getting started on a platform like Upwork or Fiverr, or
    other ones (there are a few of them), how do you actually get the first client
    with all this competition and with all these other freelancers on this platform?
  sec: 2039
  time: '33:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's a very good question. You have to, again, have patience. [chuckles]
    That's definitely the biggest piece of advice. And you have to have persistence.
    You go step-by-step. First, you build a basic resume or portfolio. Upwork helps
    you. Upwork wants you to get clients because, even for business-related reasons,
    they get some money out of all this. So you definitely have support from the site.
    I, myself, had to watch a lot of YouTube videos of people who work on through
    the site and were in the same spot as me. I think the first thing is to build
    a basic portfolio. Try to find some clients' jobs and try to take them. Post as
    beautifully as you can on why you want the job or what you can do about it.
  sec: 2059
  time: '34:19'
  who: Antonis
- line: If they reject you, it's fine. Try to learn from it and why it happened. Improve
    step by step. For me, it helped a lot. Again, have this process – I didn't get
    any jobs in the beginning. Then I found out things like I should write better
    messages to them trying to explain exactly what I can do for them. Also, apart
    from my message, I started sending them attachments, which I didn't do at first.
    I built a PowerPoint with all the procedures that I've done myself – not ones
    that have to do with actual clients. I actually had an MLOps project that I did
    for DataTalks.Club and I put it there and I had it attached in my message.
  sec: 2059
  time: '34:19'
  who: Antonis
- line: In the end, by improving your profile every day, every week, you will have
    higher chances. You might not get the best client in the beginning, but if you
    get a small job, you might get five stars. Okay, you didn't get much done, but
    you got the five stars. Then you get another five stars. Then you climb more and
    more and more. So it's a process. You have to invest your time and have patience.
    But I think it could be rewarding.
  sec: 2059
  time: '34:19'
  who: Antonis
- line: From what I heard, it looks like the course helped you actually get clients.
    [Antonis laughs]
  sec: 2220
  time: '37:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it helped. [chuckles]
  sec: 2225
  time: '37:05'
  who: Antonis
- line: Good. Happy to hear that. So you said that you were constantly improving and
    trying to figure out why rejections happened. Why do you think the rejections
    actually happened? Because your profile wasn't complete? Because the clients weren't
    sure that you can do the job? What was the reason?
  sec: 2229
  time: '37:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: If somebody else gets the job – maybe another person had written a better
    cover letter or was a better fit for the job, had more skills or had more experience.
    Or maybe they offered their services for less money. I think it depends. The thing
    that always helps – maybe something I didn't say before – is to have a specific
    skill. A year ago, I saw a lot of chatbot people. If you have very good experience
    in building chatbots, you can focus only on that and get some clients there. That
    helps a lot. I wasn't that person.
  sec: 2247
  time: '37:27'
  who: Antonis
- line: You don't get feedback from clients all the time, you have to ask for it.
    If you don't get an answer, you can make assumptions. But I always saw this in
    YouTube videos or the instructions or the advice Upwork gave and I saw that I
    was not writing a good cover letter or maybe I asked for too much time or I had
    to have more skills for my resume.
  sec: 2247
  time: '37:27'
  who: Antonis
- line: Was it worth it? It looks like you went through a lot of trouble to actually
    start getting clients. Do you enjoy working there?
  sec: 2347
  time: '39:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: It wasn't that I was doing only that. Again, for me, it was a learning experience
    from the beginning. So I enjoyed it. Also the frustration you get from not being
    where you should be kind of helps you build up until you achieve success.
  sec: 2355
  time: '39:15'
  who: Antonis
- line: You kind of get a push to develop yourself, right?
  sec: 2386
  time: '39:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah.
  sec: 2390
  time: '39:50'
  who: Antonis
- line: Okay, cool. Now, in addition to your work at a startup, you have a few extra
    gigs that you do at Upwork, right?
  sec: 2393
  time: '39:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Right. I just finished one recently. It was the one with segmentation
    that I was talking about. But right now  I don't have any.
  sec: 2404
  time: '40:04'
  who: Antonis
- header: Pricing your work as a freelancer
- line: I've heard that one of the problems with Upwork and other similar platforms
    is that there are a lot of people who work for very little money and you kind
    of have to compete with them. How did you solve this problem? How do you come
    up with the price for your offers – for your projects?
  sec: 2418
  time: '40:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I'm not able to answer this exactly. This is indeed an issue. I put an hourly,
    you know, $43 per hour. And I'm trying to follow that as much as I can, depending
    on the project. If the project is not gonna take a lot of time for me and it's
    not very complicated, I might lower it. If it's a big corporation, I will definitely
    put that rate. So it also depends on the client.
  sec: 2439
  time: '40:39'
  who: Antonis
- line: Secondly, it depends on, again, me valuing my time. I have my income from
    the startup and I'm okay. I have a basic salary. So the question is the rest of
    the time that I have. How much do I value it? If the value is like $10 per hour
    for a pet project that is not going to offer me something new, (like new skills,
    for example) then I'm not going to accept. If it's $10 per hour, but it's something
    that is definitely going to give me new skills and I really like it, I might do
    it. If it is very good money, I will do it. So it depends on how I divide my time.
    [chuckles] It's personal.
  sec: 2439
  time: '40:39'
  who: Antonis
- header: The process after getting approved by a client
- line: So let's say you are at Upwork and you see a nice project, then you probably
    apply to this project, you send a cover letter, you send a PowerPoint presentation,
    and then you come up with a price depending on the type of the client. What happens
    next (after you apply)?
  sec: 2532
  time: '42:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a very interesting part of the process. After that, you might have
    already done an interview to get accepted, but then another process starts. You
    start with an approach to the client's problem. I've personally seen that I have
    to make sure that the tasks for getting to the final solution (or the milestone,
    at least) that has been decided is crystal clear, or as clear as it can be. So
    I try to talk with the client about this, and, again, it will depend on the client.
    If it's a big corporation, it's easier to do that. If it's only one person, it's
    more difficult.
  sec: 2553
  time: '42:33'
  who: Antonis
- line: After the first interview (after getting accepted) you have to do a kind of
    inspection (a data inspection, we can call it) where you see “Okay, what do they
    have? Is it true that they have what they said? Is the data that they were saying
    indeed there?” I take some time and see, “Okay, can I solve it in the way that
    they asked? Or do I have to tell them how I'm going to solve it?” So you do these
    more theoretical and less practical parts. Then you have to both agree with your
    stakeholder (or your client) and then you start doing the actual task. While you're
    doing the task, you have to create some milestones, “Okay, I did that. This is
    where we are. Do we like it? Let's move on.”
  sec: 2553
  time: '42:33'
  who: Antonis
- line: It looks similar to what we talked about with the Lean stuff. Right?
  sec: 2667
  time: '44:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Yeah, it's a philosophy. [chuckles]
  sec: 2671
  time: '44:31'
  who: Antonis
- line: So you just work on milestones, then you see if the client is satisfied with
    what you did, and if they are, you continue working. You get constant feedback
    from them, right?
  sec: 2677
  time: '44:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's always what you want to do. I can say it's easier if I can do
    that myself. There are always some things that are unpredictable but it's okay.
    I sometimes fail to do this kind of process myself and I try to improve it every
    time.
  sec: 2689
  time: '44:49'
  who: Antonis
- line: In order to work as a freelancer do you need to register a company or how
    does that work?
  sec: 2712
  time: '45:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You have to register as a freelancer for your own country so when you
    get some income, you can say, “Okay, I make an invoice and publish it in the country
    and so they can bring in the taxes.”
  sec: 2718
  time: '45:18'
  who: Antonis
- line: You don't just go to Upwork, register and start earning money, right? There
    is some preparatory work.
  sec: 2754
  time: '45:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Maybe you can do it and never get the money in your bank – it can stay
    forever on Upwork. I don't know if you want that. [chuckles]
  sec: 2761
  time: '46:01'
  who: Antonis
- line: Oh, so if the money is in Upwork, then what are you going to do with this
    money?
  sec: 2778
  time: '46:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I don't know. You can actually put it there until... I don't know. Maybe you
    can do it and then start a company on your own to get the money into your bank.
  sec: 2785
  time: '46:25'
  who: Antonis
- line: First you try to get a few clients and if this thing works out, then you go
    through the paperwork. So you don't have to take money immediately off the platform.
  sec: 2798
  time: '46:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Or maybe you can do them in parallel, because doing the paperwork may
    take some time depending on where you are. There can be some delays – various
    public sector things.
  sec: 2807
  time: '46:47'
  who: Antonis
- header: Wearing many hats as a freelancer and while working at a startup
- line: At your work, you have to wear multiple hats. We talked about many different
    things that you need to do, like talk to clients, maybe even do videos – all that
    kind of stuff. While, here, as a freelancer, you're more focused on machine learning,
    right? Or do you still need to do some extra stuff as a freelancer?
  sec: 2824
  time: '47:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think, again, it's communication skills – the whole process that I described.
    If you have good soft skills, it will help you because you have to control the
    whole process with the client. You also have to present to them what you did.
    Maybe you don't have to really be technical. Again, these kinds of skills are
    very, very valuable. I think you can, again, connect it with everything – like
    business. You are your own business. I was thinking about how you value your time,
    and you have to decide that.
  sec: 2848
  time: '47:28'
  who: Antonis
- line: You may have to get business knowledge for yourself. But these are skills
    that you can learn along the way. You may run into some failures, and you can
    learn from them. I think if somebody listens to this podcast and makes a checklist,  it's
    not very easy to track all of these things unless you do them. I think you asked
    before – if you want to start, just go for it, and it will be very valuable, for
    sure. You'll get some good skills.
  sec: 2848
  time: '47:28'
  who: Antonis
- line: Thank you. There's a question from anonymous, “I struggled to get freelance
    work. Other than being consistent in the search for freelance work, do you have
    any other suggestions?” I think we discussed this partly. Iterating and improving
    your profile was one thing. Is there anything else you would recommend to this
    anonymous person?
  sec: 2942
  time: '49:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: I didn't hear the second part.
  sec: 2966
  time: '49:26'
  who: Antonis
- header: Other suggestions for getting clients as a freelancer
- line: The question is, “I struggled to get freelance work. Other than being consistent
    in the search for freelance work, do you have any other suggestions?”
  sec: 2969
  time: '49:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Okay, I see. I think it can be a good idea to see what is valuable for the
    client and for you to get a job. So if you're being persistent and taking a lot
    of jobs, it will help you. The other thing is to fix your profile every day –
    try to see what you can improve. If you can improve your profile every day, in
    one month, you're going to have a very good profile. While you're doing that,
    I think you can also see where you want to focus your skills, or whether you want
    to learn something new. While you're doing the search, also learn a skill, or
    improve your skill set. That's also very valuable.
  sec: 2980
  time: '49:40'
  who: Antonis
- line: For sure check out YouTube videos and tutorials from other people in the Upwork
    community. They will help you, definitely. You can follow their advice. While
    you're doing the skills, maybe you can build your portfolio – similar to when
    I did a project from the MLOps course and put it on your GitHub and then put it
    on your presentation and attach it to your next cover letter. Those are things
    that I can think of right now.
  sec: 2980
  time: '49:40'
  who: Antonis
- line: So for anyone who is struggling with getting Upwork clients, do our courses
    and do projects in our courses. [chuckles] [Antonis agrees]
  sec: 3091
  time: '51:31'
  who: Alexey
- header: Antonis' thoughts on the Data Engineering course
- line: Cool, thanks. Coming back to what you do at DataTalks.Club. This is something
    I wanted to talk about at the end. We already mentioned that you took part in
    our courses. You also recently finished the data engineering course. Right? [Antonis
    agrees]. Did you like it?
  sec: 3102
  time: '51:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I liked it. There were some skills that I wanted to learn more. I really
    liked it. I didn't have a lot of exposure to streaming and I wanted to focus on
    that a lot in this one. For the final project, I used Kafka – Confluent, actually.
    I would totally recommend this course to anyone. I really liked the document that
    you had. You had this document with the answers to questions that people had –
    frequently asked questions. That saved a lot of time. It was amazing how many
    times I had the same issue as other people. I think it's not easy to take a data
    engineering course because there's a lot of technical little things – versions
    change as you go.
  sec: 3122
  time: '52:02'
  who: Antonis
- line: It's very annoying.
  sec: 3197
  time: '53:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it was. But it was a very valuable thing to do.
  sec: 3199
  time: '53:19'
  who: Antonis
- line: What was your project about? You mentioned it was streaming, but what kind
    of project was it? Did you also do it about semiconductors?
  sec: 3208
  time: '53:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: No. No, I wanted to actually make something valuable for DataTalks.Club. [chuckles]
    I tried in the beginning to use the Twitter API. But I was seeing that I was taking
    a lot of time to get accepted as a developer there. I don't know what the reason
    was. Maybe some people do it faster, but I couldn't. So I said okay. I wanted
    to scrape Twitter for people who were specifically talking about DataTalks.Club
    and somehow use data. I said “Okay, I cannot do that.” So I went to the YouTube
    videos and I was thinking, “Okay, maybe I can do something about that.” I took
    the YouTube API, and I actually saw a video from somebody called Chris Jenkins,
    I think. He was using the YouTube API and playlists and taking the metrics from
    the videos – number of comments, number of views, and all that.
  sec: 3217
  time: '53:37'
  who: Antonis
- line: And he was streaming this to Telegram, when something new like a comment appeared.
    So I said “Okay, I will use kind of the same logic but I will put it on BigQuery
    and Stream every few seconds, the number of views, comments and likes. And then
    you can examine the dashboard.” From BigQuery I put in Looker. That was the streaming
    part. There were also other metrics that came as a batch. In my head, I was like,
    “Okay, maybe it's not useful to put in a stream. Maybe you can schedule it for
    every day or something like that.” So that was another pipeline. There were struggles,
    but it was useful. But it was funny. [chuckles] In the end, YouTube didn't allow
    me to use the API more than like 100 times per day, so it was a bummer. In the
    end, I couldn't make something like I wanted. Again, I took the tools that you
    had in each video and made something that did what I wanted.
  sec: 3217
  time: '53:37'
  who: Antonis
- line: Yeah, that sounds so cool. Maybe for those who are struggling with coming
    up with a portfolio project – because it's important for a freelance job – or
    for those who are now listening to this and taking the course right now, and they're
    struggling with coming up with a project idea. Do you have any recommendations
    for them?
  sec: 3380
  time: '56:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Find something that you personally like and try to see if there is data
    about that. And if there is, maybe you can build (if it's a data engineering project)
    a dashboard – or if it's a machine learning (MLOps) model. It does not have to
    be perfect. Definitely doesn't have to be perfect. Just try to make sure that
    you have this nice idea that you like, and it will definitely make you more eager
    and you're going to enjoy the whole building process more.
  sec: 3401
  time: '56:41'
  who: Antonis
- line: Yeah. What if I don't know what I like?
  sec: 3442
  time: '57:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That's another philosophical question. I think you should go out there
    and explore. Maybe join a startup, join a corporation, maybe do a break and try
    to see what you're passionate about. Explore. [chuckles] Like a reinforcement
    learning model – try to focus on the exploration part.
  sec: 3446
  time: '57:26'
  who: Antonis
- header: Antonis' resource recommendations
- line: Okay. Well, I guess we should be wrapping up, so maybe a last question for
    you. Do you have any resource recommendations for anyone who is listening to this?
    I think you mentioned the Lean Startup book. Maybe you have some other recommendations?
  sec: 3476
  time: '57:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I will definitely, again, recommend people to read The Lean Startup
    book. It will help them, whether they're in a startup or not. The whole idea of
    that process of working. I recommend that book for data scientists and machine
    learning engineers, analysts, I would also recommend a second part of it called
    Lean Analytics. It focuses a lot on the measurement part and finding good metrics
    for your startup or your project. It's a 10-year-old book but a lot of the parts
    are up to date. I think the writers update it. I would also recommend a book I
    really like (I'm kind of finishing it now) called Designing Machine Learning Systems.
    It looked very nice. It's a book by Chip Huyen.
  sec: 3491
