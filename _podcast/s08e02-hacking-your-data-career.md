short: Hacking Your Data Career
title: Hacking Your Data Career
transcript:
- line: This week, we'll talk about hacking your data career. We have a special Marijn.
    Marijn is a sociologist and a data scientist. He works at Capgemini. Did I pronounce
    it correctly? I had to look it up.
  sec: 70
  time: '1:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: You pronounce my name correctly. Everything's fine.
  sec: 84
  time: '1:24'
  who: Marijn
- line: I trained. [laughs] Marijn works at Capgemini as a data scientist manager.
    I think the last time we had you at our event, you were a senior data scientist.
  sec: 88
  time: '1:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: What comes after “senior data scientist”? I don't know. So now I'm a managing
    data scientist, which is great because I get less recruitment spam now – clearly,
    everyone just Ctrl F's “senior data scientist” and that's it. I don't fall into
    that category anymore. So easy.
  sec: 101
  time: '1:41'
  who: Marijn
- line: You have probably seen Marijn talking about doing good with data, for example,
    in our events. In general, you have probably seen him on LinkedIn posting stuff
    about data and other topics – cats and other things. Welcome to our event, Marijn.
  sec: 118
  time: '1:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you for having me.
  sec: 137
  time: '2:17'
  who: Marijn
- header: Marijn’s background
- line: Yeah, I had to train myself a little bit with your name, because you were
    already at our event last time. Before we go into our main topic of hacking a
    data career, let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career
    journey so far?
  sec: 139
  time: '2:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure thing. It started like nine years ago – that's painful to admit – when
    I started out studying sociology. My dad told me, “Man, you're never going to
    get a job like that. Sociology? Who does that?” But what I learned during my studies
    was how to predict election outcomes, model Twitter data and discourse, how to
    mine social media – that kind of stuff. Because even though a lot of social science
    focuses on human behavior qualitatively – like interview surveys, etc – you can
    also do so quantitatively, which means I was modeling pandemics even before COVID
    was cool. I did Ebola. Good times. That one we managed to contain.
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Marijn
- line: For my graduation, I was modeling how many people get stabbed in my hometown
    of Rotterdam and what main neighborhood circumstances could predict lower or higher
    numbers of stabbings and drug crime and such. Then I met Capgemini and the entire
    field of data science told me “Man, that's cool. That's data science and AI.”
    I thought it was just statistics and distinctively not sexy. I said, “Sure, now
    please give me a job.” And that's how I became a data scientist.
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Marijn
- line: That was very short. [laughs] I got comfortable listening to your stories
    because you have a good way of telling stories.
  sec: 233
  time: '3:53'
  who: Alexey
- line: I can go on for a few more if you want me too. But the main point here – and
    that's also something we're going to talk about a lot today, I think – is that
    I stand out in the field of data science because of my background. But that has
    little to do specifically with social science and more with that your background
    actually determines a lot of your competitive advantage in data science. It's
    not about knowing the same stuff as the next guy or girl, it's about what you
    know that they don't know. I see tons of kids these days shitting their pants
    as they look at the labor market and they try to know the deep learning algorithms
    better than their peers. That is a tough thing to compete on. Try to compete on
    the things that you know that they don't know, rather than the same things. That's
    how I got lucky.
  sec: 242
  time: '4:02'
  who: Marijn
- line: So what do you know that they don't know? Sociology?
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: I did a mixture of sociology, criminology, and quite some statistics. I remember
    one of my very first projects we had – we were modeling the effects of gender
    and my computer science and AI peers (because we work in a team) were like, “Okay,
    how do we test that?” And I'm like, “Oh! Checking for gender bias! I know that!
    I studied that crap for four years!” So yes, I studied bias and discrimination
    and algorithms for four years and was told I'd never get a job. I hit the labor
    market and everyone's crying about bias in algorithms and I’m like, “Hey, what
    happened?”
  sec: 303
  time: '5:03'
  who: Marijn
- line: In the same way, I have economists, like astronomists or astrologists – one
    of the two, I always mix them up and they get angry over that – physics people,
    there's one who did psychology, theoretical mathematicians – all part of the teams
    I lead these days, and we all see different problems. We also see different solutions.
    But by screaming and arguing at each other, we find better solutions. The opposite
    of that is what you see in most organizations, where their entire data science
    team is just 10 people who studied econometrics or 10 people who did computer
    science – and there's nothing wrong with either study – but if you do econometrics,
    you're kind of stuck soon as you have to do NLP, to give you an example.
  sec: 303
  time: '5:03'
  who: Marijn
- line: Does it happen because of the interview process? Let's say the person who
    does the interview asks just what they know, and then this way…
  sec: 398
  time: '6:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you think about marketing and recruitment bottlenecks – this process is
    crazy, because we only grab the specific words that we think we need for our team.
    This is not a data science problem. This is an IT and the entire labor market-wide
    problem in that we recruit based on boards, not actual capability. The same reason
    tons of people only recruit data engineers these days, assuming they also have
    data science capability, because they previously just recruited everyone who said
    “data science” and then found out they couldn't do the engineering part. Meaning
    we're now doing the same faulty mechanism, just with another word in our recruiting
    and find data engineers who can't do the data science part.
  sec: 409
  time: '6:49'
  who: Marijn
- line: Yeah, but how can you find them?
  sec: 454
  time: '7:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: We keep depending on V lookup, basically, for our recruitment.
  sec: 456
  time: '7:36'
  who: Marijn
- header: Standing out in data science
- line: You mentioned that people need to find something they know that others don't
    know. Since you mentioned that – this wasn't a part of the questions I prepared,
    but maybe you maybe you can help with that. A few days ago, I think it was yesterday,
    somebody in DataTalks.club asked this. The question is, “I'm trying to find the
    most complete curriculum for data analytics, data science, and machine learning.
    Each site has different things and so on.”
  sec: 462
  time: '7:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: The question goes on to find the perfect curriculum. Here, you say, “Hey,
    forget about all this stuff.” Right? If you learn deep learning, then everyone
    else also knows deep learning. So what would you advise to this person? What would
    you suggest to this person? Their goal is to find a data role – what would be
    your suggestion?
  sec: 462
  time: '7:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Striving for perfection is something you do in academics and in science.
    As soon as you step outside of that, you realize there''s no such thing. There
    is no perfect model, there is only “good enough.” Now do you realize that data
    science is basically three things: statistics, programming, and a field you apply
    it in. To my great surprise, the field and the statistics, I already studied.
    Just like a computer scientist has programming and statistical math activity.
    But you start with one of the three and then you learn the second one through
    a minor (or I didn''t know) and the third you just kind of wing.'
  sec: 511
  time: '8:31'
  who: Marijn
- line: There is no perfect curriculum, just like there is no consensus within science.
    There shouldn't be. Science agrees that this is a very dangerous statement to
    make. In the same way, your “perfect curriculum” at the micro level (because you
    can have a local one) very much depends on the field you're coming from. Now,
    this relates to my previous statement of “Don't double down on the things you
    don't know. Double down on the things you know that give you a competitive advantage.”
    Sure, I try to improve my programming. I will never be as good a Pythonist as
    some of the computer scientists in my team – also because I still prefer R (I'm
    sorry). But I don't try to compete on that stuff.
  sec: 511
  time: '8:31'
  who: Marijn
- line: No data scientist, except a few unicorns are complete experts on both programming
    and statistics, as well as – I don't know, finance or outlier detection or whatnot.
    You grab the part you're good at and you improve on that, because that makes you
    a valuable asset and a valuable addition to a data science team. The only alternative
    is an organization where you are the only data scientist and you have to do all
    three, which is very educational, but also makes you lose hair. It also means
    that you're working for an organization that really doesn't understand a damn
    about data science, because one data scientist is not a data science team.
  sec: 511
  time: '8:31'
  who: Marijn
- line: Okay. So, if I summarize – don't strive for perfection and just double down
    on things you know. That will give you a competitive advantage. For you, the competitive
    advantage was your social sciences background, right? You already had some experience
    with – I think you mentioned quite a few things –election outcomes, modeling,
    and finding the district in Rotterdam with [cross-talk]
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: For example, yes. We did big time. We found some really big issues in a model
    when we were predicting burnouts. We had to interview a ton of people for that
    – to check if our findings for biggest predictors of burnouts were actually valid.
    Everyone was like, “How the hell do we interview people?” And I'm like, “Oh! I
    know! I studied this and I interviewed a ton of people.” They were mainly criminals.
    But as it turns out, interviewing people without bars in between is basically
    the same, just slightly more scary. Which, again, was a thing that I happened
    to know that made me a valuable addition to the team – as you know a greenie.
  sec: 676
  time: '11:16'
  who: Marijn
- header: Doing the opposite of what people tell you
- line: Okay. [laughs] I came across your post on LinkedIn. I reached out to you multiple
    times inviting you for the podcast. Then I saw this post, and I thought, “Okay.
    This is what I want to talk to Marijn about.” And the post was about “how to hack
    your career” and this is actually the name of the event we have.
  sec: 725
  time: '12:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: First you wrote “How do you hack your career?” and the answer was “Do the
    opposite of what people tell you.” So can you tell us more about this post that
    you made and what exactly did you mean by that? Maybe you can also give some examples.
  sec: 725
  time: '12:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think my post started (or ended) with the quote, “Why try to fit in when
    you were born to stand out?” As far as career advice goes – and this is more than
    just data science – if you're, I don't know, a florist or you're into accounting,
    (maybe not accounting, but you get what I mean). Everyone wants to make you “fit
    in”. It is natural behavior of us upright monkeys – to do the same as the rest
    does. But if you want to get that job, or that assignment or that project or you
    want to excel – if you want to stand out – then why the hell would you do the
    same thing as the rest? Oh, let me guess. You're going to try to do the same thing
    as the rest who stand out? That still means you're still mimicking other people.
  sec: 764
  time: '12:44'
  who: Marijn
- line: I started out the whole LinkedIn game a few years ago, trying to do whatever
    all the popular people were doing. More than half of it really didn't work because
    I wasn't doing anything authentic. I wasn't doing anything “me.” I was just mimicking
    some other monkeys rather than that even other monkeys. Now, I'm pretty sure there
    are a lot of students here listening in on this in addition to data scientists.
    If you're in a team and everyone's everyone delegates tasks – because we have
    hierarchies and we have top-down management and everyone shits down – I learned
    that rather than waiting passively to get your assignment and your tasks, it really
    helps you and them to be proactive in that. If you are the first in the room to
    say “No, I'll do this” and you pick up the task – first, you get to choose which
    task you get to do. So not the sucky one – that helps you. Secondly, you're standing
    out. You're the one they'll go to next time because you were proactive. And that
    is scary, especially the very first time when you are fresh out of college, on
    the work floor, but it gets easier the more you do it.
  sec: 764
  time: '12:44'
  who: Marijn
- line: I have a story about my hair, I think you mentioned it previously. I am known
    as the guy with, you know – beautiful hair. On LinkedIn as well. But one day I
    had to call the boss. I'm not gonna mention names, but I have to mention that
    I had to call the boss of the company I work for in the Netherlands. It was an
    escalation, it was an important thing. His phone number was just in the system,
    but you have damn good reason to call him. Because he'll pick up. And I said,
    “Hi. This is Marijn Marcus speaking.” And he said, “Who?!” I'm like, “[whispers]
    oh, crap. Then I said, “The long haired guy who talks AI.” And he said, “Oh, you!
    How’s it goin’?” That's when I realized that my long hair is my trademark. It
    has nothing to do with data science/AI, but it makes me stand out. Now, that doesn't
    mean y'all need to grow out your hair. But it does mean you can own and should
    rock the things that make you unique, rather than just trying to fit in. Because
    that never worked for me and it won't work for you either. You can spend a whole
    lot of time, money, and effort on being just like everyone else. But I don't think
    that makes you happy and I don't think that makes them happy unless they really
    like matching ties or something like that. That goes for the rest of the LinkedIn
    post as well, I think.
  sec: 764
  time: '12:44'
  who: Marijn
- line: But maybe about this “delegate task” instead, your suggestion is be proactive.
    First, pick the task, which gives you an opportunity to choose things. So it's
    like, there is a meeting and then somebody says, “Okay, we need to do this thing.”
    And for that thing, I imagine there is a senior data scientist who decomposes
    the task, the product manager says, “We need to do this.” Then the senior data
    scientist says, “Okay, for this, we need to do this, this and this.” And you can
    say, “Me, me! I want to do that!” Is that right? How does it happen usually?
  sec: 996
  time: '16:36'
  who: Alexey
- line: This also relates to our previous topic of the “perfect curriculum,” because
    practice is better than any amount of training. Because I was proactive back in
    the day – in my first few projects – “Okay, sure. I'll do that. Then maybe you
    can do that.” Half a year later, I was being asked “So what management skills
    do you have?” And I realized, “Oh, hell. I was basically doing the scrum master
    thing over there at some point.” Everything is a learning opportunity. Working
    in teams as well. This is in part about being proactive and it's also about picking
    up opportunities to learn, like managing teams, distributing tasks, being a product
    owner, being the go-to person for a specific topic.
  sec: 1029
  time: '17:09'
  who: Marijn
- line: Especially for the young people – also the old people in the field – you want
    to keep learning. If you don't want to keep learning then why the hell are you
    in this field that keeps changing so much from year to year? And every new project
    that I do, I see as an opportunity to do something I haven't done yet. That's
    always scary at first. It gets less scary, the more you do it. But it's a waste
    of you if you don't grab that opportunity to learn. Because if you're not learning,
    then why are you doing it? Just for the money? Then you should quit your job and
    become an accountant. Though, they'll all be automated away in 20 years, I'm pretty
    sure. Don't be an accountant.
  sec: 1029
  time: '17:09'
  who: Marijn
- header: Don’t shoot the messenger (carefully sharing your findings)
- line: Yeah – some accountants are very difficult to automate, I think. Anyways,
    we already talked about everyone delegating tasks. Then you also mentioned being
    proactive, right? What was next on the list?
  sec: 1131
  time: '18:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, you have to list? Well, there was stuff like…
  sec: 1146
  time: '19:06'
  who: Marijn
- line: '[laughs] Or just, what else was on your mind?'
  sec: 1149
  time: '19:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh I was going to give a terrible example – a lot of projects, especially
    in data science/AI, focus on forecasting, because people want to know the future.
    Let's be honest. But to know the future, you need to know the past. That's why,
    at first with feature engineering, you're basically usually researching what happened
    in the past and why. Some of the biggest causes of events in the past – I'm gonna
    use the burnout model again – I found a lot of people were having burnouts because
    of a few specific managers. Because you don't quit your job, quit your manager.
    So we found that some of the biggest predictors were a few sets of individuals.
    And I announced that.
  sec: 1152
  time: '19:12'
  who: Marijn
- line: People said “No, no. You shouldn't mention that. You shouldn't mention it.”
    I'm like, “I should mention it, because if we're going to try to predict who gets
    the burnout next, we need to be able to explain how the model works. Otherwise,
    they won't trust it and they won't use it.” Explainable AI is actually just all
    about regression and decision trees, and explaining how your model works and modeling
    the past. Again, I happen to have studied that stuff. To me, it was new that you
    can turn the model around to predict the future. But everyone told me not to mention
    that. Because then I was presenting to management that those four managers were
    actually causing a lot of attrition and a lot of burnouts. Those managers were
    in the crowd. So I got my ass kicked on that project, clearly. It all blew up
    in my face. But the rest of management was listening. Upper management loved it.
    Middle management hated it, because I made everyone laugh at them. I pulled down
    their pants. But because I mentioned that, later on, upper management actually
    acted upon those insights. I said what anybody else dared to say.
  sec: 1152
  time: '19:12'
  who: Marijn
- line: Now, there is a high chance of being the messenger that gets shot in data
    science, because you're the first to stumble upon bias, discrimination, all kinds
    of stuff. You know the Amazon recruitment case, where humans are actually I think,
    discriminating. But then they trained an algorithm to recruit people and found
    that it grabbed only white males. Then they called the algorithm evil and they
    went back to human recruiting, which is probably just as biased, but it's not
    expressed in data – so it's “okay”. We encounter a ton of this stuff, which is
    fun to me. This is why the field is fun to me. But it's also why the field is
    so valuable. If you don't say this stuff, you're not doing your job right. You
    should say it in a careful way, like “No, I anonymized the data.”
  sec: 1152
  time: '19:12'
  who: Marijn
- line: That's what I did a few months ago when I was analyzing a large company regarding
    which parts of the organization had pay gaps – like gender pay gaps, that kind
    of stuff. I didn't mention anyone by name. I just gave them the hashes. “Oh yeah,
    I found out that these bastards are the most sexist in pay gaps.” Okay. “Oh, that's
    so bad. That's terrible. Who is it?” “Well, I don't know – because it's all anonymized.
    But here is the hashing list, so you can look it up.” And then they looked it
    up and they got angry at them. So then it wasn't me that was the messenger who
    got shot. You get better at telling this stuff in a way that doesn't kill you.
    But it is so valuable and so important to mention this stuff. Because working
    in a data-driven way is still new to so many companies – so many organizations.
    And it's a fun part. It would be a waste not to. Same as it's a waste to keep
    your head down.
  sec: 1152
  time: '19:12'
  who: Marijn
- line: I do have a list actually. I have a post in front of me. One of the things
    I have is “Instead of getting told not to ask questions, ask anyway.” Was this
    something you already covered, or no?
  sec: 1389
  time: '23:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I was told not to question by everyone why certain managers relieving – regarding
    burnout. So you should.
  sec: 1405
  time: '23:25'
  who: Marijn
- header: Advising the seniors
- line: Yeah, the next one. Or one of the next ones – “Don’t be advised by a senior
    with 20 years of experience. Instead, talk back and advise the seniors.” Do you
    have a story about that?
  sec: 1417
  time: '23:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's an easy one. That's just hierarchies – pyramid models of organizations
    – where the older you are, the more you know. I think IT struggles with that really
    badly because there's also a ton of people who are woefully outdated in their
    knowledge and a lot of them don't want to admit it. But a lot of them also like
    it when you teach them stuff. It doesn't mean they don't want to learn. But you
    also have legions of people who just nod and say “Oh, yes, sir. That's great.
    We should continue with this horrible legacy application idea. Yeah, landscape.
    Yeah, sure. Sure. By all means. It's the safest.”
  sec: 1428
  time: '23:48'
  who: Marijn
- line: Then the entire damn thing burns down because it was all legacy. Don't tell
    people they're stupid. I learned that. I do that way too often. But give them
    an opportunity to learn. This is how I became friends with CTOs of multiple organizations.
    It was an accidental reply-all mail, I'll admit this. I hope you're not listening.
    “Data science, AI blah, blah.” And I said, “Well, actually no. You got that and
    that and that part wrong.” It was a reply-all mail. Oops. But it did get me coffee
    with the guy in the end.
  sec: 1428
  time: '23:48'
  who: Marijn
- line: So what did you talk about over the coffee?
  sec: 1509
  time: '25:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, we slightly skimmed over the fact that he misunderstood some stuff and
    then we just talked about what else we were doing. A lot of people – let's be
    honest, we're all nerds here – we're very much interested in the stuff people
    do. “Oh, how did you do this? How did you do that?” In intakes. I am barely ever
    mentioning what perfect curriculum I followed or what degrees and certifications
    I had. I mainly just talk about “Oh, yeah. I encountered that problem before.”
    “Well, how did you deal with it?” “Well, the data quality sucked. Like this and
    that and I fixed it like that and that.” “Okay, and then what?” “Yeah, then I
    insulted the managers to their face. I learned from that. And then okay.” You're
    telling stories. We all tell stories using data because stories and experience
    are so much more valuable than Pokémon badges?

  who: Marijn

  sec: 1563
  time: '26:03'

  sec: 1569
  time: '26:09'
  who: Alexey

    badges. You collect certifications.

    Well, it's exactly just like in academics, actually. The professor also likes

    not going to do that by calmly sitting in the corner and waiting for them to give
    you a Vlookup task. This happens to a lot of data analysts as well. They get hired
    somewhere and go “Yeah, go do this thing in Excel,” or “Go do this very simplistic
    analysis.” The cool ones then go like “Okay, I can do that. We can also run a
    time series model to automate that stuff.” Because they don't know that – you

    it's not going on for a few more months. Coffee Machine, stereo blah, blah, blah,
    amount of COVID cases in the Netherlands, my balcony lights. More importantly,
    these are my plants. I add the sensors to my plants – to check their humidity,
    light, temperature, the poopy icon on screen shows if they need fertilizer. I
    think this one definitely needs fertilizer. There’s also the battery icon because
    it's just sensors in the plants broadcasting over Bluetooth and the Raspberry
    Pi picks up those, writes it to a database and this dashboard then picks up the
    latest numbers and actually gives me audio cues (my plants scream at me) when
    the threshold of “oh, you need to water your plants” is reached.

    ass about “Oh yeah, sensors, AI, IoT!” And I just literally pulled this thing
    out of my pants and showed them and they were convinced, “Okay, Marijn knows plans.”
    Also, this one is tracking the local police radio to show me where the stabbings
    are in my neighborhood (also fire) so I can go watch… in case you know, “fun fires”
    are happening near my house. And yeah. That’s stuff I do at home. But then – here
    comes the important parts everyone – then I'm working and it turns out this is
    valuable experience. In the same way that I was asked “Hey, what do you know about
    social media analysis?” and I just started talking about an e-purse I wrote during

  sec: 2036

    all have different thresholds. On the backend, it knows what the type of plant
    is and what the threshold is, so they also scream at me if I overwater them. But
    believe me, that occurs less often – because it's a rare event.

    I'm not worried about them cyber attacking my plants because the sensors only
    send data – they can't kill my plants through it. The rest of the rest of it all
    run Zigbee, so it's all localized. It's not Wi-Fi, it's not Bluetooth and it all
    runs through Iceland. So I'm pretty secure on that end. Like really, if you're

- line: This is a question I get quite often. “How do you get inspiration for these
    projects?” I imagine it might be difficult. Let's say you are looking for a job
    because you're switching careers or you're just graduated or for whatever reason
    – you want to have a portfolio. Then the question is, “How do I build this portfolio?”
    Okay, you can go to Kaggle. You can pick a competition. You can take part in this
    competition. Then you can train a model, and then maybe if you're lucky, you can
    get a silver medal. Then you put it on your CV. But so do the rest of the people
    there, right?
  sec: 2233
  time: '37:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Don’t get me wrong, I highly respect the Kaggle grandmasters who can optimize
    the heck out of stuff. I can't do that to that extent. But that brings me back
    to my original statement, “Why fit in when you're born to stand out?” Because
    it takes so much effort to be the top 0.5% who beats all the rest in the same
    Kaggle competition. It's much easier to create your own competition like I did
    with my coffee machine. How did I get the idea? Because I'm lazy. Because I didn't
    want to walk to my kitchen and back just to turn it on in between meetings, and
    then walk again one minute later. It is pure, unadulterated laziness. That is
    the main force behind automation in the modern world – and makes for really good
    developers. Laziness that got me to build that stuff  – also sheer curiosity to
    see if it would work.
  sec: 2269

    to the plants in your flat, but other ones?
  sec: 2346
  time: '39:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think this is a broader data science thing in that you shouldn't just build
    what they ask, but instead you should build and do what organizations need. Many
    of you will join organizations and like “Yeah, we need something with data. We
    need something with AI.” But you're there to solve problems and help them make
    better decisions. There's a reason why Google calls it “chief decision scientist”
    these days. If you're just building what they ask – which is usually Excel++ stuff
    – you are not profitably applying all the ideas, all the knowledge, all the skills
    that you have.
  sec: 2356
  time: '39:16'
  who: Marijn
- line: This brings me back to the “be proactive” part and “suggests stuff.” This
    is the important part. This is why they call me a consultant, because I come in
    there because of my expertise. But most data scientists are consultants within
    their own organization because they're the guy or girl who knows that stuff that
    the rest doesn't know.

  sec: 2425
  time: '40:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Yeah, sorry. To get back to that – it's an NGO. Two, three NGOs that
    we're working with in India and Kenya. They aid smallholder farmers in developing
    countries – help them achieve higher yields because between 30 to 50% (depending
    on your math) of the food in the world is produced by smallholder farmers, according
    to UN statistics. So if you want to help world hunger – and holy moly, we're going
    to get another world hunger crisis this summer – you need to help the smallholder
    farmers produce more. So we give them advice on how to achieve better yields,
    what their yield will be at the end of season, how they can apply crop rotation,
    planting what would actually give them the highest earning and stuff.
  sec: 2430
  time: '40:30'
  who: Marijn
- line: We use weather satellite imagery, all kinds of feeds for that. I'm hopefully
    going to India in two months to help out over there – to speak to locals, to interview
    them, to figure out what they use and what they don't use. Because here we have
    part of the ask, like “What is my yield going to be at the end of season? I would
    like a forecast.” But the optimization part they are not asking for, but we are
    going to provide that anyway. Because if we’re building a prediction model, we
    will see what the biggest predictors are for you. And we can advise you on that.
    We can talk to you about that. Some of those predictors, they can change – you
    live in this part of the West Bengal region, it's that fertile over there. So
    that's the yield you're going to get. Some other things, like what they plant,
    when they plant it, how they plant it – I am by no means a farming expert, I have
    sensors to keep my own plants alive – but this is stuff that they do not ask,
    but that is of immense value to them when you give it to them.
  sec: 2430
  time: '40:30'
  who: Marijn
- line: That, again, is data science and also my niche in the field, I guess. Everyone
    screams about “explainable AI,” but I think there's a very small threshold between
    explainable AI and just using statistics and models to explain what the hell is
    happening to help people make better decisions. And I do that for my job. A lot
    of Dutch and international organizations also want to help smallholder farmers
    in God-knows-where, because it's the same damn thing – just different data and
    like 15 different ways of spelling cow dung.

    I'm part of a team. I'm bragging about it, but I'm just one of five glorious bastards
    who work on this project. We all have different skills – that one knows much more
    about farming and that one can make PowerPoints that I never could. It's collaborating

    to learn.

    know the same stuff, you will feel very inadequate because they know more about
    your specific field. But here, I'm working with a guy who actually was a farmer
    years ago. A lot of tractor jokes, I swear. But he can advise me, and us, on stuff
    in ways I can't. So I don't need to stress out over knowing everything because
    we work in a team for that. I just stress out over knowing the things I should
    know. Believe me, that’s stress enough.

  sec: 2679

    out. And that is exactly what you want. You can stand out with your hair, or you
    can stand out with having experience and knowledge that nobody else does. Again,
    in my team, I have this guy who studied aerospace – God knows what. But he knows
    everything about Boeings and it's really interesting during lunch to hear everything
    about airplanes. But as soon as we're talking – I don't know logistics optimization

    again, right? I think it's related to war in Ukraine. This is something we've
    talked about recently and one of the things you mentioned is that, as a data scientist,
    you can do what you called “open source intelligence.” Can you talk about that
    a bit and also about hunger?
  sec: 2759
  time: '45:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. Let me start out about open source intelligence, also known as OSINT,
    is the field of grabbing social media data – stuff that's open, that's out there
    – and using it as valuable data to do stuff. I was already doing that 10 years
    ago when I was studying to grab Twitter data in order to analyze which parts of
    the Netherlands would and wouldn't be open to receiving refugees. And the war
    in Ukraine is the first modern information war on earth. It is incredibly interesting
    what we're seeing over there. History is being written. I'll skip all the doom
    scrolling because I just spent three months just doom scrolling. But just yesterday,
    did you see the deep fake of President Zelenskyy being posted?

  sec: 2844
  time: '47:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: Smart move. That's a very smart move. But this was the first time in history
    that people used deep fakes to impersonate a president to spread fake news. And
    it's not just Putin dancing and singing Abba. No, it's actually a serious misinformation
    campaign based on machine learning techniques. Now, back to OSINT – first few
    days, Ukraine was using GPS Intel based on Russian soldiers who took their phones
    along to figure out where the soldiers are and to send drones and bombs after
    them, which is terrifying and horrifying. Because this is war and I am doing –
    I don’t condone the violence and that kind of stuff. But simultaneously, it is
    so interesting to see two modern states, with modern technology, at war. We've
    never seen that before.
  sec: 2849
  time: '47:29'
  who: Marijn
- line: Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine – it's all horrifying what's happening
    over there, don't get me wrong. I hope we get more sympathy for those people and
    their plight thanks to Ukraine. But the images we got from there was usually night
    vision goggles of people really zoomed out with turbans, so to say. Now we have
    high quality imagery hitting the internet 24/7 and we have a huge social media
    response to that. We also have people going on Tinder, like I was last week. I
    was Ivanka. I was using a GPS spoof to pretend to be on the Ukraine border and
    I was matching with people in Russian uniforms and we were all just reporting
    our location and the amount of miles – the distance to that person we matched
    with – because somebody else also matched with Ivan, but was over there. That
    way, you can triangulate that the Russian soldier, who you are Tindering with,
    on which part of the Russian/Ukraine border (because that's where he’s stationed)
    on which part they are. Thus we can, on scale, analyze where the reinforcements
    are on the border and the Ukraine Government actually uses this information.
  sec: 2849
  time: '47:29'
  who: Marijn
- line: It's absolutely crazy and I haven't even started about Anonymous using DDoS
    attacks to take down Russian news, for one, which was also really interesting.
    Because then Russia as a country started blocking foreign IP addresses, so you
    couldn't do DDoS attacks like that anymore. And yet, a few hours later, the DDoS
    attacks continued, because they were coming from within Russia itself. And this
    is all open information that we're using for very violent purposes. But it's never
    happened before. And it makes our field as data scientists relevant in ways that
    it has never before been relevant. I think that will only increase in the future.

    Anonymous, obviously, people on Reddit (unfortunately, especially Reddit) compiling
    lists. The whole Tinder thing is a Reddit thing, I'll admit this. Just gathering
    data. There's tons of open maps where we aggregate Twitter reports and sightings
    of “Oh, hey. Here, your bombs are falling. Oh, we saw track tanks driving over
    there.” I help out sometimes with that as well in the evening – of just pinpointing
    those tweets. There's no GPS, because the Ukraine government asked the population,
    “Please turn off your GPS,” because that's a way to target you. But these reports
    are coming in and we're mapping those – pinpointing them on maps – to see movement
    of troops.

    gonna use this data that we collect on Tinder and Twitter these days – they're
    gonna use that in court in X months time. That is big. That's all data. And that's
    all data that's out there that we can use. It's free for the picking, really.
    To make matters worse, we basically knew this was coming for half a year, because
    for half a year people have been tracking the fact that there were tons of military
    trains everywhere in Russia going towards the border. That was mapped. We knew
    all the tanks – that data was also present.

    for the record. And fuck – I pray for their safety. But historically, these are…
    this has never – this is unique. Never before. That brings me to the last part
    and that's the famine. I'm also working on a few projects for that. Did you know
    that the Ukrainian flag – the blue and the yellow – is actually grain? The blue
    is the blue sky and the yellow that's this golden grain – because it's the breadbasket
    of the world. So we're gonna see huge decreases in grain production over the next
    year, which will lead to higher grain prices, but also higher meat prices worldwide,
    because a lot of that grain is actually used to feed animals.

- line: Yeah. Okay. I don't know if I should change the topic or not because we have
    some questions. One question from Mike (you probably don't see this question because
    it’s from Slido). Mike is asking “Should data experts learn soft skills, like
    people skills, communication, networking, drinking, as well as hard skills to
    go further and faster?”

- line: It goes both ways. Whatever makes you unique – what makes you better (I don't
    mean you should paint your hair purple, by the way) but whatever makes you stand
    out and gives you an edge works. Even if it's being the one who can also talk
    to the people, the one who is not afraid to stand on stage – I did opera as a
    kid. That is why I can talk about it like this, I'm pretty sure. Because when
    you sing Italian for 500 people in pants that are way too tight, you can tell
    500 people about data. But the point here is – it doesn't mean it all has to be
    social skills.

    client suddenly wants AWS – you're the only one who also worked with AWS. That
    works too. Just don't be the same as everyone else, which you want to be. I know
    a guy who did eSports for a few years, and thanks to that, he excelled at his
    project because they were mining (I don’t know, League of Legends or some shit
    data) and he happened to have played it in the past. So he was like “the expert”.

    didn't really work that well. I think, even though my dad never gave me much advice
    in the world of data because he really doesn't get it, he did give me dating advice,
    which is “Don't pretend to be someone you're not.” And career wise, it's exactly
    the same. Don't pretend to be someone you're not. At least not in the long term.
    That doesn't help you and that doesn't help him or her, or your clients, or your
    boss.

- line: Yeah. Right. Well, we still have time for one more question maybe. This is
    something I wanted to ask you – so one question about LinkedIn. I see that you're
    pretty active there and you have quite a few followers. What is your growth strategy
    there? Is it about posting cats and memes, or?
  sec: 3450
  time: '57:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: LinkedIn is an algorithm, same as any other. It's the nearest-neighbor-style
    matching algorithm, I believe. You can optimize that. Open secret – I think you
    should post on Thursdays and Tuesdays between eight and nine in morning, your
    time. There's an optimal time to post. There's an optimal amount of hashtags and
    people to tag in your posts. Type of material you post – you trend a lot less
    if it's an animated video. If it's without a picture, it's circulated even more.
    There is a ton of stuff you can do to optimize your posts to get a bigger reach.
    I may or may not have done the same for dating apps in the past. But now this
    scratches my itch, you know.
  sec: 3470
  time: '57:50'
  who: Marijn
- line: If you optimize (I could do a whole lecture on how to optimize LinkedIn) you
    will get a bigger reach and that is fun in and of itself. I am basically trying
    different things and for the first year or so it was terrible. I was just trying
    to reverse-engineer what works and what doesn't work. And for me, that is – try
    to post on weekdays between eight and nine in the morning. Because your posts
    will basically circulate for one hour and after that, if it doesn't reach a required
    amount of likes or comments, it will stop trending. Comments are much stronger
    than likes. If you want to support a post, comment. LinkedIn is a comment-driven
    algorithm, not a like-driven algorithm. If it reaches the threshold of attention,
    then it will circulate for like 12 hours. This is why I need to post early in
    the workdays, because then you will have the morning, everyone checks their phone
    while they're on the loo or having a coffee. Meaning, you optimize your odds of
    getting liked in that first crucial hour. Then you'll also be trending over lunch
    and dinner. If you post three at night, very few people we're going to like it,
    unless you have a lot of Australian friends.
  sec: 3470
  time: '57:50'
  who: Marijn
- line: 'Then there''s the content thing, which is – there''s three types of posts
    on LinkedIn: bragging, information, and humor. I remember a big marketing manager
    from a company I shall not mention going like, “Hey man! Posted any memes recently?”
    Even though I trend harder than I bet his entire marketing department. Most people
    and organizations just post bragging stuff, like “Oh yeah! I have the certification!”
    Or “I got this promotion!” Posting about your promotions is great. That''s good.
    But people like that because they know you. They don''t care about the information
    or the humor in there. But if you want to post every week, every month, or every
    day, you can''t just brag about yourself, unless you''re like Apple and you only
    post brags. But nobody likes that. Then only people from the same organization
    like your shit and nobody else does. But if you post information that''s actually
    informative to people, with humor, you can post about that every day.'
  sec: 3470
  time: '57:50'
  who: Marijn
- line: That's basically what I do. Okay, sometimes I brag. But I try not to post
    bragging posts, but just information about my field, about my experiences, about
    things I learned, about the things I did wrong – especially very funny, usually
    humor about me screwing up – like with the managers and burnouts, like I mentioned
    just now. That makes for great posting material and I have that every week. So
    if I inform people, people like that. Bragging they will only like if they know
    you or your organization. But if it's informative and relevant to your field,
    people outside your organization and outside of your field of connections will
    also like it.

- line: I have more followers and people (you can analyze this). I have more people
    liking my stuff from Accenture and KPMG than from my own damn company. Are you
    listening to me Capgemini? Like my shit more! But that does mean it is a value
    to them. Don't try to brag about yourself or be funny about yourself. Give them
    something that informs – that they can use. If you just keep sending information,
    giving information, you will start getting information back – same as talking
    with the seniors.

    I have to point out that at least half of the memes I post are my own. The other
    half might be from 4chan.
