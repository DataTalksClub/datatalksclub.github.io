title: Data Scientists at Work
transcript:
- line: Hi, everyone. This week, we'll talk about the work of data scientists and
    the expectations from them. We have a special guest today, Misra. Misra is a data
    scientist and content creator. After working as a data scientist for many, many
    different companies, she decided to create her own platform for teaching data
    scientists. Maybe you heard about this website – So You Want to Be a Data Scientist.
    Now we finally meet the person behind this website. Now I think you work as a
    developer advocate at AssemblyAI, right?
  sec: 67
  time: '1:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, that's correct. I still work on my platform and my YouTube channel, but
    I also create content for AssemblyAI.
  sec: 103
  time: '1:43'
  who: Misra
- line: Okay, yeah. So, welcome.
  sec: 112
  time: '1:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. It's great to be here.
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Misra
- header: Misra’s background
- line: Before we go into our main topic, let’s start with your background. Can you
    tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 117
  time: '1:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I started in this whole thing when I did my Bachelor's in computer science,
    even though I did not really know what I was getting myself into. And through
    the courses that I took during that time, I realized that I kind of like artificial
    intelligence and I felt like, “Okay, this thing is actually going to be the future
    of data science (or generally the world).” Back then it wasn't really top of mind
    in the world and AI was just starting to mature. I decided to also do a Master's
    in that area. I did my masters in Big Data engineering. During that, I started
    taking projects, doing internships, and I ended up at IBM.
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Misra
- line: That's where I also started my first job as a data scientist. Through that
    I did a lot of projects in many different companies, because – maybe the listeners
    would know – that when you're a consultant, they send you to different companies
    to do projects, basically. After a while, I decided that the consultancy life
    is not really for me, I was not really getting a lot of excitement out of it.
    So then I decided to join a startup working as a data scientist. There, it was
    actually really fun and we did a lot of good work. But after a while, I was like,
    “Okay, now I feel like I am ready to build my own thing.” So I completely focused
    on my work as a content creator through blog posts, podcasts, and a YouTube channel.
    I basically sell online courses to that platform too, and everything else is kind
    of educating people and educating the community – going to that goal.
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Misra
- line: Yeah, so that's what I've been doing for the last couple of years. Recently,
    I joined AssemblyAI as a content creator – you should go check it out. It's a
    great company. We're building a really nice product, which is a speech-to-text
    API. On our YouTube channel for Assembly I do we make weekly content on deep learning,
    machine learning, and Python tutorials in general. So yeah – that's where I am
    right now.
  sec: 125
  time: '2:05'
  who: Misra
- line: How did you end up becoming a developer advocate? I guess you understood that
    you really like creating content and through a developer advocate role, you do
    this for living, right?
  sec: 251
  time: '4:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. You know how they say those who can't do, teach. [laughs] I guess I
    didn't really want to do data science day-to-day. The projects that I worked on
    were fun, but at IBM, for example, we took on this project to give trainings to
    a very big company (I don't think I'm allowed to say the name( but it's a multinational
    company that is all over the world. For them, I started preparing data science
    educational material, and also gave that training to them over a couple of days
    to like 300 people.
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Misra
- line: I realized that I actually kind of like teaching people through what I learned
    at the projects that I was a part of at IBM, and decided, “Why don't I do this
    online?” I was getting a lot of questions from people who wanted to become data
    scientists asking me like, “How can I become a data scientist? What should I learn?”
    After a while, I actually got tired of answering everyone one by one, so I was
    like, “I'm just going to write a blog post about this.” It kind of started that
    way and then one blog post led to another, and before you know it, I was making
    videos. So that's how it all happened.
  sec: 264
  time: '4:24'
  who: Misra
- line: Then, I guess, you also at some point decided to do this professionally by
    becoming a developer advocate. Right?
  sec: 334
  time: '5:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I mean, the developer advocate part came very recently. I was just
    kind of making videos to promote my own platform. But AssemblyAI found me online,
    and they were like, “We really like your style. Why don't you do this for us?”
    And I was like, “Okay.” [chuckles]
  sec: 341
  time: '5:41'
  who: Misra
- line: '[chuckles] I think this is a common story. I heard this story quite a few
    times. I guess because I interview people like you who are also quite into content
    creation so the story they shared is pretty common. A company notices them and
    says, “Hey, why don''t you do this for us full time?”'
  sec: 357
  time: '5:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. That's the great thing about building something in public, right? You
    really put your skills out there and people see you. People realize what you're
    doing and that really opens a lot of doors.
  sec: 375
  time: '6:15'
  who: Misra
- header: What data scientists do
- line: Well, coming back to our main topic – data scientists at work. Maybe there
    are some parallels to data developer advocates, but you were a data scientist
    quite recently. Coming back to this topic, imagine you're a data scientist, not
    a developer advocate. How do you answer the question “What do you do at work?”
    to your friends and relatives?
  sec: 389
  time: '6:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, that is one of the trickiest things they can ask me [laughs] because
    I have no idea how to explain it to someone who is not tech savvy at all – like
    my mom, for example. My very recent resolution wants to just tell them, “You know
    ads? Sometimes you search for something and then you start seeing ads about it
    everywhere? It's kind of like that.” [chuckles] That's what I told them recently
    to make it more understandable.
  sec: 414
  time: '6:54'
  who: Misra
- line: Generally, I try to say, “We collect a lot of data through your phone when
    you go on a website. They're tracking where you look at, where you click, how
    much you engage with their content. And all of this data and more data are being
    collected and someone needs to do something with it.” I know, it still sounds
    very vague, but generally that's what I tell people. I am the person who deals
    with the data and who is the professional that knows how to create value out of
    it.
  sec: 414
  time: '6:54'
  who: Misra
- line: My son recently asked me – well, not recently, it was a year ago, but I still
    remember it as if it was today – he asked me, “What is data science?” And I was
    like, “Uh, what?” [laughs] It took me completely by surprise and I didn't know
    how to answer. He watches a lot of YouTube, so I say “You see these recommendations
    on YouTube? This is kind of similar.” I'm not really doing recommendations, but
    the concept is similar. Depending on what you like, we show something else. But
    now he thinks that I'm actually doing these recommendations on YouTube.
  sec: 472
  time: '7:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Of course. Yeah, it's easier to explain to people on an application because
    it's such a vague area and you can do so many different things with it. When you
    give one example, it kind of confuses people and kind of makes it a bit more tangible,
    I guess. But, yeah – it's really tricky to describe.
  sec: 508
  time: '8:28'
  who: Misra
- line: You have a blog post about this, don't you?
  sec: 525
  time: '8:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It’s generally like, “What is the work product of data science?” Like,
    what do we produce?
  sec: 529
  time: '8:49'
  who: Misra
- line: So what do we, data scientists, produce at work?
  sec: 537
  time: '8:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: I actually took on a lot of different roles and a lot of different projects
    and that's how I got to experience this a little bit myself, because with every
    project, we needed to deliver something different. Also, through the podcast,
    I've met a lot of different data scientists, machine learning engineers, data
    analysts, and I also heard from them what kind of things they produce. It's basically
    a wide variety of things. One thing you can produce, for example, is a trained
    model. Maybe that's like the simplest thing if you're a data scientist that works
    with machine learning or deep learning. Maybe all they want from you is a model
    that can produce accurate results, right? That's the simplest possibility.
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: Misra
- line: Or maybe they will want you to create a complete pipeline where they will
    constantly add more data and then it will produce something. This could be anything
    – some results, maybe some information, recommendations, it could also be like
    the YouTube recommendations you mentioned. Another thing it could be – maybe they
    just want you to do a presentation to them and that's what I did most of the time.
    Even though, okay, I'm a data scientist and generally people think data scientists
    work with machine learning – there are times where you don't even need to do any
    machine learning whatsoever. So what you do is analyze the data and you present
    your results and that's actually good enough.
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: Misra
- line: Or it could be that you prepare a report and then you give it to someone,
    like a manager, who needs that. There was this one project I did for a bank, they
    just had some jumble of data and they could not understand it, and my job was
    to understand the data and then make a report out of it of what is going on and
    why. So they knew something was going on – something was going wrong – but they
    did not know how. They had the data, but the data was so confusing. They needed
    a person to focus on this full time.
  sec: 541
  time: '9:01'
  who: Misra
- header: Consultant data scientists vs in-house data scientists (and freelancers)
- line: Was this something that you did at IBM, or is this something that maybe consultants
    tend to do more often? Like creating presentations and reports?
  sec: 658
  time: '10:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely, yeah. There are many different ways you can be a data scientist.
    That's also something I say a lot on my website – when you want to become a data
    scientist, you should really think about what kind of work you want to do. If
    you end up becoming a consultant data scientist, then what you're going to do
    most of the time will be related to reporting and presentations, or creating a
    dashboard, for example. So you're completely right about that. That was something
    I did during my consultancy years, also. [chuckles]
  sec: 668
  time: '11:08'
  who: Misra
- line: I guess the other things you mentioned – training a model, creating a data
    pipeline – is something you create more often as a data scientist working at a
    product company, like at a startup?
  sec: 699
  time: '11:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, definitely. I think being an in-house data scientist comes with a bit
    more responsibility. You probably become a bit more like the expert in the company
    – that depends on the size of the company, of course. Especially if it's a small
    company, you really end up becoming the go-to person to build all of this. Some
    companies have separate engineering teams so you would only have to create a model
    and then give it to them and they deal with it.
  sec: 715
  time: '11:55'
  who: Misra
- line: Some companies don't, so you would have to create the whole pipeline, which
    requires a bit more engineering and DevOps skills to write. So yeah, these things
    really matter, I think, in terms of knowing these things and these varieties and
    this whole range – it’s important to choose the right position. That's why I try
    to point this out as much as I can when I meet a new person who wants to become
    a data scientist.
  sec: 715
  time: '11:55'
  who: Misra
- line: Like you said, it's important to think about what kind of work you want to
    do in order to decide what kind of data scientist you want to be. One thing you
    could decide is to work at a product company as an in-house data scientist. Another
    thing is consultancy – a data science consultant. Is there something else? Is
    there a third type of data scientist?
  sec: 767
  time: '12:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think not in that sense. You can always be a freelancer, as a separate consultant,
    for example. But I think also inside companies, if you're an in-house data scientist,
    the team matters, too. You can be one data scientist in a team that is building
    a product – that would come with different responsibilities. You can also be an
    in-house data scientist, but in the data science team. So you would be just one
    of the many data scientists – that will also come with different responsibilities.
  sec: 789
  time: '13:09'
  who: Misra
- line: It also depends on how they assign you to different projects. Are you working
    solo on projects? Are you working with a bigger team? Like I said, that may include
    engineers or not. All of these things make every data scientist in the world a
    little bit unique, actually. That's why I think it's so important to ask questions
    to the company that you're applying to, in order to fully understand what is waiting
    for you on the other side.
  sec: 789
  time: '13:09'
  who: Misra
- header: Expectations for data scientists
- line: So there are all the different ways to work as a data scientist. Actually,
    this brings us to the other thing I wanted to talk about. There was one article
    from you that I really liked, which was about unreasonable expectations from data
    scientists. I wanted to talk a little bit about that. Maybe you can give us a
    gist about this article. What did you write about in it?
  sec: 849
  time: '14:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Basically, this is something I've felt myself when I was first starting and
    that's why I thought maybe there are other people out there who feel the same
    way. I wanted to share my thoughts and feelings about that. There is this general
    air in the world of AI, especially if you're a data scientist – a practitioner
    – that you really need to be on top of the latest developments and everything
    that is happening in the world of AI. To use a very Gen Z word [chuckles] I think
    it's toxic in a way that really makes people feel like they are not enough and
    that they are not trying hard enough, even if they are working really hard and
    they know what they're doing.
  sec: 880
  time: '14:40'
  who: Misra
- line: Basically, in that article I was talking about the concept that that does
    not have to be you. You do not have to be reading the latest articles, knowing
    about the latest innovations or the models that are coming out. You don't have
    to understand how they work and you'll be okay if you're just doing your work
    well enough.
  sec: 880
  time: '14:40'
  who: Misra
- header: The importance of keeping up to date with AI developments (FOMA)
- line: But how do you personally stay up to date with all the developments in AI?
  sec: 943
  time: '15:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, basically, I don't. [chuckles] I don't really put extra effort into
    this. There are a bunch of people I follow on Twitter, for example. But I don't
    follow them just to hear about the news, I just genuinely like their attitude
    towards life and they happen to be working in Google Brain or DeepMind, for example.
    And you kind of just hear about those things there. Well, currently, I kind of
    have to, because I'm creating content and that content is mostly about the latest
    developments in AI. That's part of my job.
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Misra
- line: But before, when I was a data scientist, I basically did not put that much
    effort into it because I know that what I'm supposed to do is my work and learning
    about GPT-3 and how it works does not affect my work one bit. It's cool, but I
    think it's more of a hobby than being necessary to be a data scientist. So that's
    why the answer to your question is – I don't really. [chuckles]
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Misra
- line: I asked because I know that, especially when it comes to NLP, (you mentioned
    GPT-3) there are so many things happening there. First, like you start with transformers,
    then other things, all the way to GPT-3. Every time I open Twitter, there is something
    new about this and I feel this FOMA (fear of missing out) like if I don't jump
    on this NLP, something will happen – I will become useless or obsolete. So how
    do you fight this FOMA?
  sec: 1009
  time: '16:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: It's kind of funny, because the people who work on models that big – I don't
    know, in total it’s probably like 50 people or something – it's not even that
    many. And there are like hundreds of thousands of data scientists in the world.
    Obviously, not all of them are working on this. But somehow, some people are just
    more interested in it – that's kind of part of their life.
  sec: 1041
  time: '17:21'
  who: Misra
- line: It's their hobby, and that's why they spend time on this. You know, it's kind
    of okay for you to not have it as a hobby. Maybe you like playing basketball,
    maybe you like going on walks. That's fine, too. Just because you're a data scientist,
    you do not have to have a different lifestyle.
  sec: 1041
  time: '17:21'
  who: Misra
- line: I think these applications and things that go viral on Twitter, most of them
    are jaw-dropping, because you see this and it's like, “Wow! I can write some text
    or I can draw a picture and then this GPT-3 creates a website from it.” I think
    there was something – I don't know if it's GPT-3 or not – but I think you just
    draw a sketch and this thing creates a valid react and HTML code from this. It
    looks nice. And it's like, “Wow, can you do this? Is this real? It’s not fake?”
  sec: 1082
  time: '18:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: There’s actually a website where you can play with this and check that it
    is actually real. I think most of these things have this effect and you think,
    “Okay. I'm not using anything like this at work. I don't know how it works.” It
    seems like because there is so much buzz on Twitter, right? It seems like everyone
    is talking about it. Everyone knows this and it's just me who doesn't understand
    this.
  sec: 1082
  time: '18:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think it's also just social media. You could say that for young girls,
    they look at all the perfect-looking influencers and they feel bad. I guess, for
    us, it's the influencers in the AI world or the technical world – we look at them
    and we're like, “Oops, these guys know so much.” I like what you said about how
    it creates a jaw-dropping reaction, because that's kind of the point of the content.
    Now that I've been working in content creation for a while, I understand this
    a bit better. Because the whole point of creating content is to surprise you,
    shock you, or get some sort of emotion out of you. That's why those people are
    working on that.
  sec: 1139
  time: '18:59'
  who: Misra
- line: That's why I made a video about DALL·E, you know? It just came out and everyone
    was shocked. Everyone was really impressed. So I was like, “Okay, let me capitalize
    on this and make a video explaining how it works. It's going to be useful, of
    course. But at the same time, it's going to be educational and people will be
    like, “Oh wow, I need to learn about this. Someone made a video, so that means
    everyone knows. Let me also get in this bandwagon.”” But it’s actually fine. I
    did not know anything about how DALL·E 2 worked before I made that video. In one
    week, I learned, and then I made a video about it. But this doesn't mean that
    everybody in the world knows about it. Unfortunately, there is this illusion –
    the community knows, so you have to be a part of it.
  sec: 1139
  time: '18:59'
  who: Misra
- header: How does DALL·E 2 work and should you care?
- line: How does DALL·E work? Maybe you can tell us in a few sentences for those who
    have the fear of missing out. Because I do. I see these awesome pictures. I think
    the way it works, as a black box, you give it some prompt like a piece of text,
    and it generates nine images that look creepily realistic.
  sec: 1221
  time: '20:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. It creates a high resolution image from captions, basically.
    And yeah, the images are surprisingly realistic. It's not the only thing it can
    do. It can generate images from captions, but it can also add items to images.
    So let's say you have a photo of an empty living room, you can add couches, you
    can say “add couch,” and then it will add different types of couches in different
    locations. Or, if you give it an image that already exists, like Salvador Dali’s
    painting with the melting clocks, it can create variations of it.
  sec: 1241
  time: '20:41'
  who: Misra
- line: How it does it is basically by understanding what is essential in this painting
    or in this image, only keeping that and changing the unnecessary or irrelevant
    details like how the background looks a little bit, where the clocks are located
    – so trivial details are changed, but the actual essence of the image is preserved.
    So those are some of the things that it can do.
  sec: 1241
  time: '20:41'
  who: Misra
- line: Yeah. Well, like it cannot imagine [audio cuts out] how it works. Like all
    these formulas that are there – they're just scary. I cannot imagine what it looks
    like for things like DALL·E like must be insane.
  sec: 1301
  time: '21:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, actually, DALL·E 2 itself is not that confusing, because it is based
    on this model called ‘diffusion models’. I'm actually working right now on making
    a video on how diffusion models work. That is scary. [laughs] That it is taking
    me a lot of work to actually understand how they work. But DALL·E 2 is basically
    a spin on diffusion models and diffusion models have been around for a while.
    Some of these big models are actually kind of a combination of previously-made
    models or technologies and kind of putting a spin on them, trying a different
    way. Sometimes it's even easier than you would expect as well.
  sec: 1318
  time: '21:58'
  who: Misra
- line: But I think I now have a fear of missing out after that. [laughs]
  sec: 1358
  time: '22:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah? Oh, wrong effect. [laughs]
  sec: 1363
  time: '22:43'
  who: Misra
- line: You said that it’s just work on top of the existing work that exists. Seems
    simple. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1367
  time: '22:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. It's basically my job to know these things. Before I started working
    as a content creator, I also did not know these things. Honestly, I also didn't
    care that much. Because most of these works, even though they're cool, they do
    not have immediate applications in real life. With DALL·E 2, what they're saying
    is “We want this to be a way for humans to understand how machines think and how
    machines create.” That's all great. That’s a noble goal to have, but at the same
    time, no one is ever going to use it.
  sec: 1378
  time: '22:58'
  who: Misra
- line: Okay, in the artistic/entertainment way it is being used right now, but we
    do not have to panic just yet. I think there needs to be some new developments
    and we need to see how we can actually apply this in the real world. It's kind
    of going to trickle down to us normal data scientists after a while.
  sec: 1378
  time: '22:58'
  who: Misra
- line: I guess what you're saying is – if you work as a data scientist at a company,
    there is no immediate application of this thing. It all looks cool, but there
    is no way you can integrate this thing into your product.

- line: Yeah, but with the DALL·E 2 case specifically. I mean, I know GPT-3 is being
    used in companies because it generates natural language and that is kind of useful.
    I know there are some apps out there that use it. But with this specific case
    of DALL·E 2, and generally image generation, I think it's kind of experimental
    – just kind of having fun, I feel like.
  sec: 1444

    – that do have applications in real life, right?
  sec: 1468
  time: '24:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: Definitely. But when you think about it, these models need so much data and
    computing power that an average startup is not going to be able to afford training
    them. They are being used by companies and at AssemblyAI, we're also doing deep
    learning research and using advanced deep learning techniques for speech recognition.
    But it requires a very seriously capable deep learning team, most of which are
    PhD graduates, and a lot of money to train these models. So if you're working
    as a data scientist at a startup that does very minimal machine learning – decision
    trees, XG boost, and everything – chances are, you are never going to use it.
    And there is not really much use, I think, worrying about not knowing about them.
  sec: 1478

    But are there cases when you kind of should be up to date?
  sec: 1530
  time: '25:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure, I think it all depends on your goal. If you are not happy with where
    you are and with what kind of work you do, and you see yourself somewhere else
    in the future, you should definitely go learn more of these skills. If you want
    to get into deep learning – let's say in your current work, you're doing more
    things like data analysis, you're providing reports and presentations, and that's
    not what you want to do – obviously, that will be a great investment of your time
    to go and learn how these models work and really understand them. But other than
    that, if you're happy with where you are and you don't really want to change the
    type of work that you do, then I don't think there's really much need for it.
  sec: 1541
  time: '25:41'
  who: Misra
- line: I guess you also need to focus on a specific area, right? It's not like, “Whatever
    is hottest now on Twitter!” but more like, “Okay, what do I want to do now? Do
    I want to work more with recommender systems?” And then you go and check papers
    about recommender systems or textbooks instead of “Oh, there is this GPT-3, or
    GPT-4. Let's see how it works. Let's try to train it.” Right?
  sec: 1581
  time: '26:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. It's kind of like being a researcher at that point, I think.
    If you're going to try to build and optimize those models, you're going to need
    a lot of experience and that means that you're going to have to make these things
    your life. If you want to work in NLP, you have to focus on NLP. If you want to
    specialize in something else like computer vision, you have to specialize in something
    else. And I think even in those areas, you still have niches that you can really
    specialize in.

    machine learning, it's a bit easier – you can be a generalist person, you can
    learn to deal with different types of data in different industries. But I think
    with deep learning, it is quite specialized, and you have to make it your life.

- line: Also, I think what helps me personally to stay away from all this buzz in
    Twitter, but if I still want to be a bit up to date. What helps me is industry
    conferences. For example, in Berlin next week, there is a conference called Berlin
    buzzwords. It's more like an engineering than a data science conference, but people
    talk about applications of data science – they talk about their specific use cases
    and say how they scale this to their workloads, to their particular use cases,
    how they tweak the papers – for example, they take a paper, they couldn't implement
    this, how they ended up actually using this.
  sec: 1659
  time: '27:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think, to me personally, this looks more valuable and useful and consumable,
    because I cannot understand papers. When I read a paper I think they’re too complex
    because they are also written in such an academic language that you need to get
    used to it. But these conferences are usually made by people from industry, and
    they are aimed at people in the industry. So I think they're more useful. But,
    of course, there are many conferences that you can go and visit in one year.
  sec: 1659
  time: '27:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think that you make a really good point. I think it makes a lot more sense
    to also have these personal relationships with people too. Because, of course,
    companies release papers, but at the same time, these are companies that are trying
    to make money. Obviously, they also don't give all the details of how they did
    something in their paper. Like OpenAI is like, “Oh, here's the DALL·E 2 paper.”
    but then, it's so vague that you don't actually know what's going on. You're like,
    “Is this what they mean? Is that what they mean?” So yeah, I completely agree.
  sec: 1744
  time: '29:04'
  who: Misra
- line: I think it would make much more sense if there are maybe industry-specific
    conferences that you can go to, then you can understand how people do things,
    it builds relationships. But also, it's probably much more useful to know what
    kind of a variation of a very common algorithm they're using in their niche and
    if that niche also is where you're working – that will be extremely useful to
    see “Hey, these guys came up with something. Let me also apply that to my work.”
    That will be much more useful than to doomscroll on Twitter and think about how
    you're missing out. [chuckles]

    from the company?
  sec: 1837
  time: '30:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. I think the one I had, at least I can answer from my perspective, and
    remembering how the people I interviewed answered me is how much people don't
    understand what data science does. I always say,”If you want to become a data
    scientist, one of the key skills that you have to have is communication skills.”
    This doesn't mean that you have to be an extroverted person or anything. It's
    just that you need to be able to explain your work in clear terms to people that
    are not technical people. When you can't do that, or the people are refusing to
    listen to you, then you have this problem of “What you're doing is not valuable.
    It is taking too much time. You're telling me that it's only 90% accurate, so
    it means it's not 100% accurate. So how can I use this in my work?” That makes
    a lot of areas in the world, like no other industries, kind of resistant to starting
    to embrace data science – some of them rightfully so, like the medical field.
  sec: 1842
  time: '30:42'
  who: Misra
- line: Of course, you want really complete accuracy if you want to use a medical
    application, but some of them not so much. There are still plenty of industries
    who are not yet using data science, partially because they don't understand it.
    That was one of the main issues that I faced. It was a big struggle trying to
    explain yourself and the work that you do in a way that people will understand.
    We were just saying in the beginning, it's even hard to explain it to your mom,
    and you have all the time in the world to explain it, and still it's kind of hard.
    When you deal with these people who have been doing the same thing, in the same
    way, for the last 30 years, it's kind of hard to change their minds.
  sec: 1842
  time: '30:42'
  who: Misra
- line: I'm wondering if these companies, like those in the medical field [audio cuts
    out] they have unreasonable expectations from data scientists? Maybe not in terms
    of how up to date they are, but in terms of the work they do. Maybe they just
    imagine the data scientist coming into the company in shining armor, and just
    defending all the data issues and creating an epic model that works?
  sec: 1943
  time: '32:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. I think it's a lot about perspective, too. I like giving this
    example of self-driving cars – a lot of people die in traffic currently and all
    cars are being driven by humans. There are a lot of traffic accidents, a lot of
    people die. But probably once we start having widely adapted self-driving cars,
    when the first person dies of a self-driving car, people are going to lose it,
    and they're going to be like, “These self-driving cars are killing people! They
    should be off the streets – they're dangerous!” Whereas probably 1/5 of the amount
    of people will die, because there'll be less accidents.
  sec: 1975
  time: '32:55'
  who: Misra
- line: But the problem is, there are going to be different kinds of accidents than
    the type of accidents that people make. So you could think, “Oh, this person was
    not going to die if this car was being driven by a person.” But then – yeah, but
    for every person that happened to, maybe there are 50 other people that no accident
    happened to. So that’s a mindset shift that I think still needs to happen in the
    world in order to fully embrace and not be scared of AI, generally.
  sec: 1975
  time: '32:55'
  who: Misra
- line: I guess, in the medical field, this is especially important. Self-driving
    cars are also a sensitive area, because this is about people's lives.
  sec: 2042
  time: '34:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. I think it's completely valid. The only thing I don't understand
    is when people also resist using AI assisted systems. I think it makes a lot of
    sense to have AI systems helping doctors, or medical practitioners in general,
    to make decisions. It doesn't mean that it has to make a decision autonomously.
    But maybe just something like help me by taking the easiest cases off your hands,
    or just kind of help me assist you in your decision-making. But I think even that
    is being met with a lot of resistance so far.
  sec: 2053
  time: '34:13'
  who: Misra

    the jobs, right?
  sec: 2090
  time: '34:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that also doesn't help, generally. Also when you talk to your friend
    who does not really know much about AI, and they hear about this new technology,
    and then everyone is like, “Oh isn't it scary?” That's one of the first things
    that I hear from people, “Isn’t it scary?” And I'm like, “No, it's not. These
    things are stupid. [chuckles] You don't get it. It can only do this one thing
    and one thing only. It's not about to take over the world or anything.” But, of
    course, it's kind of hard to know that when you're not in the field.

    segue to this topic – having this fear of missing out. I think it creates a feeling
    that I'm constantly unqualified. So I am afraid that the world is moving on, but
    I don't understand this thing and because I don't understand this thing, I will
    not be able to do my work well. And if I don't do my work well, then I'll be out
    of work, and I will not be able to get another job. I will have to clean the data
    for the rest of my life. [chuckles] So where does this feeling come from?
  sec: 2131
  time: '35:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it's because we are constantly working towards a moving target. That's
    my main observation. Like we said, there are always new models coming out, new
    technologies coming out, other people are doing amazing work. And then you see
    all about it on social media or maybe even in your company – in your other data
    science team that is in your company. It is kind of hard to imagine that you are
    enough when you see all these other people. But I think it's just because you
    have a list in your head – you think that “Okay, when I know all of these things,
    I will be a complete person – a complete data scientist,” but then you keep adding
    things to that list.
  sec: 2179
  time: '36:19'
  who: Misra
- line: At the end, you never actually reach that point where you feel confident in
    your skills. I think that's the main issue that data scientists deal with. New
    things are coming out nearly every day – at some point in that startup that I
    was working at, I was trying to (not implement, but) use a model for which the
    paper was published 20 days before I started working on it. I was like, “Okay,
    cutting edge… but at the same time a little bit stressful, honestly. Because no
    one knows how it works.” There are not enough Stack Overflow questions about this.
    There are not enough Reddit posts about it. So it gets a bit too much, I think,
    at some point.

    different things, but I think we just didn't end up using it in the end. But I
    learned about it. So that's something. [laughs]
  sec: 2265
  time: '37:45'
  who: Misra
- line: There is this concept of the imposter syndrome – is this list that we have
    in our heads that we keep adding to related to that? I guess it’s something like,
    “I am an impostor until I cover everything in that list.” But at the same time
    [audio cuts out]
  sec: 2278
  time: '37:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's really a terrifying feeling when you think about it, because all
    you can focus on is, “I got to this point by luck. I don't actually know enough,
    and someone's going to figure it out. They're going to point and laugh at me.”
    But generally, I'm not sure if people who are really established in their fields
    would feel that way. But I definitely think that's something that many beginner
    data scientists feel in their first couple of years. I think that happens because
    there is this ‘air’ in many companies, that you should already know about everything
    when you start to start your job unless it's not specifically said that that’s
    not the case. But that's really, really not the case.
  sec: 2301
  time: '38:21'
  who: Misra
- line: Most of the time, when companies hire entry-level data scientists or beginner-level
    data scientists (junior) your job is to learn new things. Your job is not to already
    know things. Your job is to have this baseline where you know the basics and you
    can pick up new concepts really quickly. Therefore people feel like imposters,
    but actually, they are exactly where they should be. They don't have to know anything.
    There's so many different frameworks, languages, and libraries that you can use
    – there is no way that you can know all these things. Your job when you just start
    a company – it doesn't even have to be junior level, honestly, you can be a medium
    or even senior – that you just have a way of learning things quickly and that's
    your job. You start to start some work and you just need to ask questions –question
    other people's decisions, ask them about how they did something and learn about
    these things. Honestly, for me, that's what it means to be a data scientist –
    and not necessarily knowing all of these things in advance.

    decide to pick it up and learn it a little bit better. We don't want to learn
    it perfectly – we know that this is not going to be a great way of spending our
    time, so we just want to learn it a little bit. How do we know when we know it
    well enough to stop learning about it?
  sec: 2412
  time: '40:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a good question. I guess what I would say is – let's say you have a
    job that you want to apply to and that's why you learn this thing. You saw that
    there are requirements listed and this is one of the frameworks that you should
    know. How I would go about this is, basically find other companies where they
    are looking for this and interview with them. This way, you see what kind of questions
    they asked you and if you feel like you know enough to answer these questions.
  sec: 2442
  time: '40:42'
  who: Misra
- line: But this is always tricky, because every company has a bit of a different
    expectation from people and different levels of competency when it comes to languages
    and frameworks and technologies and stuff. So that would be a really hard question
    to answer, I think. But, as I said, what I would do is to learn the basics and
    bring myself to a point where I feel like if they tell me, “Hey, can you learn
    how to do this in this framework,” that I could do it in like one day.
  sec: 2442
  time: '40:42'
  who: Misra
- line: Perhaps another useful thing is to focus on a specific use case – a specific
    application – and once you achieve this result, then you’re ready. For example
    let's say you need to build a webform quickly and you found this Streamlit framework.
    You have a form in your head and once you have something similar, then it's probably
    good enough and you can move on.
  sec: 2507
  time: '41:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: But if you cannot build the form you want in your head, maybe you need to
    ask yourself, “Is it even possible? Maybe I should stop trying and look at other
    ways of doing it.” So again, the question here is “How do you know when to stop?”
    What is helpful, I think, is to give it a timeframe. For example, “I will spend
    no more than two, three days on this and then if it takes more than that, then
    maybe it's not worth it.”

- header: The “best” type of data scientist
- line: Okay, I see that we have quite a lot of questions. I also prepared questions
    for you, but I think it's better to go through the questions. The first question
    is about the types of data scientists and this is something we talked about at
    the beginning. The question is, “Which type of data scientists do you like being?
    And which type is the best?”
  sec: 2567
  time: '42:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Oh, well. I actually think this is one question. Because the one I like being
    I feel like would be the best for me. [chuckles] Let me think. I think, from the
    ones I experienced, I like being an in-house data scientist the best. Because
    when you're a consultant data scientist, you are being sent out to a different
    company and that company is basically the client. Then, you cannot really judge
    their decisions too much – you have to do what they want from you. The same thing
    happens if you're a freelancer, for example. You have a client and you have to
    go with their rules. Of course, you can guide them and try to nudge them in the
    right direction, but at the end of the day, if they want something, they want
    something.
  sec: 2588
  time: '43:08'
  who: Misra
- line: But when you're an in-house data scientist, you really have the power to say,
    “No, guys. This is wrong. You shouldn't do it that way.” And I really like that
    because it gives me a feeling of completion. I do not have to be like, “Okay.
    I know that's not the right way, but let me do it that way.” You can really say,
    “No, I am the expert here and you have to listen to me.” That's something I really
    enjoy, so that's why I would say it's my favorite. Of course, you can always be
    in a more research-focused environment. You can be a researcher in a company or
    in academia.
  sec: 2588
  time: '43:08'
  who: Misra
- line: That's also possible if you call yourself a data scientist at that point,
    of course. That's kind of a choice. Some people call themselves ‘AI researchers’.
    But that one, I think, is also really fun. I just don't like that version because
    then your life is a lot about the research and not always about producing results.
    And I kinda like seeing quick results. So that's why in-house data scientist is
    my favorite and I think is the best one.
  sec: 2588
  time: '43:08'
  who: Misra
- line: I haven’t worked as a consultant data scientist, but from what I heard from
    other people who like doing this, they like the exposure to different projects.
    Because they are not “stuck” with the same problem for two years, but they get
    to work on many, many different problems and as a result they have a broader (not
    necessarily deep) skill set, but quite broad.
  sec: 2698
  time: '44:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: For some people, this is what they like to have because every client is a
    little bit different, they work on a little bit different or (maybe completely
    different) problems, so they get exposed to different things. But again, you probably
    have to ask yourself, “What do you like more – seeing the results of your work
    or just preparing PowerPoint presentations, handing it over and not knowing what
    happens after that?”
  sec: 2698
  time: '44:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's definitely true. You do get exposed to different projects. But
    if someone out there wants to be a consultant that's their reason – they want
    to work on different projects – I would really urge them to ask the company, “How
    many kinds of different projects their data scientists worked on this year?” Because
    sometimes there are no projects and then you don't have a project… and then it's
    boring. This obviously doesn't happen in every company.
  sec: 2750
  time: '45:50'
  who: Misra
- line: Also, they might tell you, “Oh, we have many different industries.” But if
    the country you're working in does not have that many different industries, then
    you are stuck with the same industries at the end of the day anyways. So those
    things are quite nuanced, I think. It's really easy to say, “Oh, yeah, I’ve worked
    in many different companies and in many different industries.” But the reality
    might not be that way. So I think that's something to look out for.
  sec: 2750
  time: '45:50'
  who: Misra
- line: Yeah. Let's say there is a company in the Netherlands that works with BeNeLux
    companies (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg) then I guess you're kind of limited
    to whatever interest there is in this geographical region because this is where
    the company works. Right?
  sec: 2800
  time: '46:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Of course, yeah. Then you are definitely dependent on the region that you're
    working in. With the Netherlands, we were actually quite lucky to have Belgium
    and Luxembourg included – Netherlands itself also has a lot of different industries
    included in them. So that was quite lucky of me. But I have definitely heard people
    having problems. For example, in Turkey, I had some friends who were struggling
    to find projects and that is not the most fun place to be.

  sec: 2853
  time: '47:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: My opinion on this is that I like to be a generalist. I like to know a lot
    about everything – well, a little bit about everything. [chuckles] But mainly,
    it's just kind of my personality, because I like learning new things. I guess
    I do not really have the patience to be a specialized person. But I wouldn't say
    one of them is better than the other one. As I said, it really depends on the
    kind of work you want to do. If you're like, “I want to be an NLP expert.” Well,
    there you have it – you have to really specialize in that area. But if you're
    like, “You know what? I like this data science thing. I want to learn as much
    as I can in this area.” Then just go ahead and learn different things, but then
    you probably have to accept that that is going to limit the opportunities that
    you can take. You will likely not become a researcher at Facebook or something.
    So yeah – ups and downs.

  sec: 2911
  time: '48:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. Basically, there is like a pyramid, let's say, where the top
    2% of job opportunities where the “elite” data scientists and researchers are
    working – that will probably not be accessible to a generalist.
  sec: 2917

  who: Misra

    to [cross-talk]
  sec: 2931
  time: '48:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, exactly. For example you work for a medical startup, the next day, you
    can go work for Amazon or something. So you can really jump around and hop around,
    because your skills would be necessarily about the techniques that you're using
    and machine learning in general, which you can apply to different industries and
    different types of work.
  sec: 2937
  time: '48:57'
  who: Misra
- line: So being a generalist is not only something for a consultant data scientist
    – it's also for data scientists working in startups. Because I remember when I
    worked at a startup, I needed to do pretty much everything. Sometimes I would
    just go get some groceries and bring them to the office. Because in a startup,
    there is no office management. If you want to get some food, go and get it. There
    is no special person controlling you.
  sec: 2957
  time: '49:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: That’s how I learned to Streamlit, for example. I mean, I didn't get groceries.
    [chuckles] But, for example, we were building projects and we wanted to showcase
    the projects. We didn't have an engineer in the team. So they were like, “Oh,
    how can we do it?” And our manager was like, “Well, I heard about this thing called
    Streamlit.” And I'm like, “Okay, I'm on it.” And then you build your work around
    that. Or I did have to do quite a bit of DevOps when I was in that company. I
    kind of like it, actually, because you just end up learning out of need. You're
    not like, “Oh, I have to improve my skill set.” And then you sit down and study
    something. It's more like, “Okay, guys, we need to do this. Who wants to take
    it on?” And they take it on and you learn how to do it. [laughs]
  sec: 2981
  time: '49:41'
  who: Misra
- line: That also answers the question “When do you know when it's good enough?” When
    it works and it doesn't break down on every second request, then it's good enough.
    Right?
  sec: 3019
  time: '50:19'
  who: Alexey

  sec: 3029
  time: '50:29'
  who: Misra
- header: Advice for entry-level data entering an oversaturated market
- line: Okay. For newer data scientists – from courses like yours or boot camps –
    how would you suggest they break into the oversaturated market for entry-level
    data scientists?
  sec: 3032
  time: '50:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think it comes down to job hunting skills. The advice I give to everyone
    is basically to apply as much as they can, but in a smart way. I think people
    get really overwhelmed with all the requirements that HR managers list. Most of
    the time, they don't really know what they're talking about. If you look at a
    list of skills that you need, and you don't know, like 20-30% of it, I would say
    just apply either way. If they're a nice company, they'll probably get back to
    you and they'll give you a reason why they're rejecting you.
  sec: 3046
  time: '50:46'
  who: Misra
- line: Also another thing – if you have a goal of being in a company, or generally
    in an industry, I would try to network. I do not like that word “networking” but
    you have this thing in front of you, like LinkedIn, and you can really use it
    to advance your career. You'll be surprised how many people actually get back
    to you. You want to be a data scientist in a company? Okay, go find a data scientist
    in that company or somewhere in a related field, or in a related role, and just
    send them a nice message, like, “Hey, I am interested in working in your company.
    I want to learn more about it.” Many times people are just happy to talk to you
    about their experiences.
  sec: 3046
  time: '50:46'
  who: Misra
- line: There are, of course, nicer and less nice ways of doing this. I get messages
    sometimes where they're a bit more entitled, like, “Hey, be my mentor.” Or something
    like that. I'm like, “Excuse me? Have we met?” [chuckles] So I think writing a
    short message, asking the people that you want to talk to, “Hey, do you have 15
    minutes or half an hour to spare to answer some questions? I'm really interested
    in your company and here are my reasons.” I think that you would get a good amount
    of response. And I think that is a great way to have an ‘in’ with people that
    are in the company that you want to work for.
  sec: 3046
  time: '50:46'
  who: Misra
- line: Yeah, “be my mentor” is something I also receive quite often. First of all,
    it's so demanding in terms of time. Being a mentor is a time investment, right?
    So I need to know you to actually invest time in you.
  sec: 3166
  time: '52:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: It’s an intimate relationship. It's not something that you just demand out
    of someone. [laughs]
  sec: 3179
  time: '52:59'
  who: Misra
- line: It's also not super specific. What kind of help do you need? What kind of
    questions do you have? I guess a good way to start the conversation is, “This
    is my problem. I don't know how to solve it. Do you know a good way?” Maybe you
    don't need a mentor – you just need to find an answer to this question, and then
    move on to another question. If you have a mentor who is always there for you,
    answering these questions – cool. But if you don't have a mentor, maybe you don't
    need one, right? There is always the internet…
  sec: 3185
  time: '53:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think people try to get help sometimes before they really understand
    what they need, exactly like you're saying. When you get a vague approach like
    that, it is very likely that I will not even reply. But I would suggest everyone
    who wants to get into a company or just generally a data science career, to really
    think about what you want – what do you need right now? – and then ask really
    direct and clear questions. If I see a question that I can answer with a quick
    voice message or a couple of sentences of text, I will definitely do it, if it's
    really nicely specified regarding what kind of thing they need help with. But
    the vaguer you go, the less likely that people are going to respond to you. [chuckles]
  sec: 3222
  time: '53:42'
  who: Misra
- header: Catching the eye of big AI companies
- line: Okay. The next question is about your current employer, AssemblyAI. “How would
    you suggest a junior level data scientist or ML engineer catch the eye of AssemblyAI?”
  sec: 3271
  time: '54:31'
  who: Alexey
- line: Interesting question. It is very hard for me to reply to this because I am
    not in the engineering team and I do not know exactly what they're looking for.
    I'm in the marketing team right now. So to not speculate and say something wrong,
    I would probably not answer this question because I don't want to misguide people.
    I really haven't even looked at the open positions and what they're requiring,
    so I don't want to speculate.
  sec: 3285
  time: '54:45'
  who: Misra
- line: But let's say you replace AssemblyAI with “Company X”. How would you answer
    that question then? If it's a company that you don't know, but maybe you have
    some ideas about how somebody would get the attention of a company they want to
    get into?
  sec: 3313
  time: '55:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, my go-to advice – and that's exactly what I do, too – is to first understand
    what this company is doing in their industry and their technology. You don't have
    to be an expert, but kind of understand what they are doing. What kind of field
    are they in? What are the main challenges in this field? This information is not
    hard to find – you can literally Google it. That's the first thing. Also have
    some questions lined up for them that will be interesting for them to answer.
    It should be interesting to you, too, because you don't want to work somewhere
    where you're going to be bored.
  sec: 3329
  time: '55:29'
  who: Misra
- line: Generally, I would really advise people to have a couple of projects out there
    that they can present, ideally relevant to the job that they're applying to (but
    it doesn't have to be) just to showcase the skills that you recently learned.
    One really good way of doing this is to build Streamlit projects on top of your
    machine learning projects that you do. It doesn't have to be professional projects
    – it could be personal projects that you did. Just have a way of proving to these
    people that you have been working on your skills and you know about their industry
    and you're curious about their industry.
  sec: 3329
  time: '55:29'
  who: Misra
- line: So just do some research, have some questions prepared, and make sure that
    you have a way of showing what you know. I know it's not really snappy advice,
    but unfortunately, that's the reality. It's not like “Wake up at 5 AM every morning,
    and then write down what you want from your day.” It's not like that, unfortunately.
    [laughs] You have to put consistent work into these things to catch people's eyes.
  sec: 3329
  time: '55:29'
  who: Misra
- header: Choosing a project for your portfolio
- line: There’s a question that is quite related. You mentioned projects – projects
    that could be potentially relevant to the employer that you're interested in.
    Of course, you need to do some research to find out what could be more interesting
    for this employer and then also prepare questions that you would ask. [audio cuts
    out] … now asks about these projects. The question is, “I see that every new data
    scientist endlessly repeats the same project.”
  sec: 3429
  time: '57:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: I think the person means like, Titanic or Cats vs Dogs (I don't know, pick
    your favorite, most famous datasets here) or Iris, for example. “How would you
    go about creating a good project for potential employers as a newbie?” I think
    you partly answered that, “Do research in the company where you want to work,
    and then find a project.” I guess it's not always possible, right? What if this
    is a car manufacturing company, for example? You cannot have a project about manufacturing
    a car.
  sec: 3429
  time: '57:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, I think that's a good point. Obviously, people are doing the same projects.
    But I think with these projects, what you're trying to show is not how great of
    a model that you're building. The model you build might suck and that's fine,
    I think. If I was a hiring manager, that's how I would think. Because what you're
    trying to show is that you understand how data behaves, you understand what kind
    of problems that can be in the data, you know how to deal with these problems,
    you know how to build a model, and you know what to do when something goes wrong
    in this model. So if it's overfitting, you are able to understand, “Oh, hey. It’s
    overfitting.” And then you can come up with some options.
  sec: 3494
  time: '58:14'
  who: Misra
- line: You don't even have to apply them, honestly. If you have a notebook where
    you do some analysis on the Titanic data set, and then you're like, “Oh. Here,
    I tried this. But then it overfit. Here are some things I think I can do to fix
    them.” Yeah, if you have time, you can go further. As you know, sometimes data
    science projects can be endless, there's so many things you can try and so many
    things you can do. It’s kind of like future work, like “If I had more time I would
    do this and that.” So that's why I don't think the project itself really matters,
    especially for beginner data scientists. It's just about showing that you can
    do critical thinking and you know the tools that are available, and you know when
    to use them. I would still not use Titanic or whatever [chuckles] because I think
    they're kind of boring. But I would try to find datasets that are from real life
    – so actually collected in real life.
  sec: 3494
  time: '58:14'
  who: Misra
- line: One that I really like to use, that I also use in my course, is New York City
    open data, which is like the taxi rides – the information or data that is collected
    on taxi rides. It is extremely dirty. There are so many things that go wrong with
    that data. It’s real life, obviously, so that happens. I would really suggest
    that you find a source like that. By the way, New York City open data has a lot
    of different types of data, so definitely go check it out. You have Reddit, for
    example – in the Reddit datasets subreddit, I think there are a lot of different
    types of datasets that people are posting. Just try to find one that at least
    resembles real life data a little bit. Of course, real life data is not really
    made publicly available most of the time. As far as I know, the ones on Kaggle
    are quite well-prepared and clean and everything. I think if you just get a piece
    of data that at least resembles real life, and then you do your best on top of
    it, that is enough of a project. You don't really have to build anything mind-blowing
    or interesting if you cannot come up with an idea.
  sec: 3494
  time: '58:14'
  who: Misra
- line: Speaking of these separated datasets, I remember I needed to find a data set,
    but Googling wasn't helpful. Yeah, that happens. I asked on this subreddit, and
    the people actually suggested ways to find this data. There is also a website
    on Stack Exchange Network, (I don't remember the exact site) but this is like
    StackOverflow but for datasets. It's “open data” or “free data” or something like
    that. You can also check it out and just ask a question about, “I'm looking for
    a data set. I need help.” Do you have time for one more question, or do you need
    to go?
  sec: 3661
  time: '1:01:01'
  who: Alexey
- header: The importance of having a PhD or Master’s degree in data science
- line: So let's take one more question. The question is “What's your stance on companies
    thinking only about hiring PhDs or people with Master's degrees?” Meaning the
    companies think only such people can be data scientists. What would you say to
    them?
  sec: 3702
  time: '1:01:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: I would say that they don't know what they're doing. [laughs] Yeah, it really
    depends. Of course, that’s kind of a controversial statement. Companies don't
    always know what they need. I think that’s one of the things that I've learned
    being in the industry for a couple of years. They just think, “Hey, we need someone
    who understands how these things work. And it seems like they should probably
    have a Master's degree, right?” They look around the room like “Probably, yeah,
    right. Yeah, probably.” They don't really know what people learn in Master's degrees.
  sec: 3718
  time: '1:01:58'
  who: Misra
- line: Honestly, I felt like I did not learn much in my Master's degree. Maybe I
    did, butI kind of felt more or less the same – like I graduated from Bachelors.
    Especially with PhDs, if you want to become a researcher and if you really need
    to understand the algorithms that you're working with, obviously, yeah – you probably
    do need a PhD. But other than that, if you're going to be a consultant data scientist
    or something similar, you probably don't need it. As I said, you go to a company
    to learn, because data science is a really practical field. Most of the time,
    we don't need to build the tools that we're using. You have SciKit Learn – when
    is anyone ever going to build a decision tree by themselves? That doesn't really
    happen.
  sec: 3718
  time: '1:01:58'
  who: Misra
- line: Of course, companies get to decide this for themselves. We can say whatever
    we want about this, it’s not going to change anything. But I think it's probably
    not fair. That's how I think about it. It's just not a fair comparison. As I said,
    it's really practical and if someone has done enough projects and is able to show
    what they've learned, just because they don't have a PhD or a Master's degree
    should not be a reason to not hire them.
  sec: 3718
  time: '1:01:58'
  who: Misra
- line: I guess there are companies, like Google Brain or Open AI, that do research
    and the only way to show that you can do research is to actually do research.
    That's why they hire PhDs, because this is proof that you can do research and
    you do not get bored, because you've spent a significant amount of time defending
    your PhD dissertation. But for other cases, yeah – maybe not so much. Right?
  sec: 3825
  time: '1:03:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, yeah. I mean, again, if a company wants to do experimental things, they
    probably want someone with a PhD or at least maybe someone with a PhD to lead
    the team. So that's understandable. But I don't think it shouldn't be a hard rule.
