  - name: Machine Learning Use Cases
    date: 2021-02-05
    eventbrite: 132703625115
    talks:
      - name: Industrial Applications of Reinforcement Learning
        time: "14:00" 
        speaker: philwinder
        abstract:
          Reinforcement learning (RL), a sub-discipline of machine learning,
          has been gaining academic and media notoriety after hyped marketing “reveals”
          of agents playing various games. But these hide the fact that RL is immensely useful
          in may practical, industrial situations where hand-coding strategies or policies would
          be impractical or sub-optimal.

          Following the theme of my new book (https://rl-book.com), I present a rebuttal to the
          hyperbole by analysing five different industrial case studies from a variety of sectors.
          You will learn where RL can be applied, how to spot challenges that fit inside the RL paradigm,
          and what pitfalls to watch out for. You will learn that RL is more than an bot in a game;
          it is the next frontier in applied artificial intelligence.

          I avoid using jargon to make this talk acceptable for a wider audience. I do expect that
          you have limited exposure to data science/machine learning in general.

      - name: How to use AI in Consumer Food Product Innovation
        time: "15:00" 
        speaker: himanshuupreti

      - name: Machine Learning in Manifacturing (TBA)
        time: "16:00"

      - name: Applying ML to Healthcare
        time: "17:00"
        speaker: eugeneyan

  - name: Product and Process
    date: 2021-02-12
    eventbrite: 132703715385
    talks:
      - name: "Hypotheses Flow (TBA)"
        time: "14:00" 
        speaker: eliasnema

      - name: Dangers of Dirty Data
        time: "15:00" 
        speaker: susanwalsh

      - name: How Your ML Project Will Fail
        time: "16:00"
        speaker: elenasamuylova

      - name: Translating ML Predictions Into Better Real-World Results with Decision Optimization
        time: "17:00"
        speaker: danbecker
        abstract:
          Machine learning models make predictions, but predictions are only useful to the extent
          they help us make better real-world decisions.

          For example, a model may predict that a financial transaction is 5% likely to be fraud.
          Should the transaction be approved, denied or delayed for further investigation? This
          decision requires further information and analysis.

          A few years ago, data scientists could build models and hope someone else would figure
          out how to translate predictions into decisions. That division of responsibility has generally
          been a failure, and now most companies expect data scientists to ensure their models lead to
          better decisions and better business results.

          Learn decision optimization techniques so you can consistently translate your models into
          better decisions and optimized business results.

    date: 2021-02-19

    talks:
      - name: "The ABC’s of Data Science"
        time: "12:00"

      - name: Transitioning to Data Science (TBA)

      - name: Monetizing Machine Learning (TBA)

  - name: Machine Learning in Production
    date: 2021-02-26
    eventbrite: 131781966409
    talks:
      - name: Introduction to MLOps
        time: "14:00" 
        speaker: larysavisengeriyeva
        abstract:
          Coming soon

      - name: Putting Data Science in Production
        time: "15:00" 
        speaker: mikiobraun
        abstract:
          Every year, the number of tools that promise to take care of everything that's needed
          to put ML into production is growing, but which tool is really the right tool for the
          job and what does what? In this talk I'll be taking a look from the inside out,
          starting with an ML algorithm and gradually adding layers to give a bit of structure
          to this area. At the end, you probably have a better understanding what kinds of tools
          exist and what you need when.

      # - name: Machine Learning Design Patterns
      #   time: "16:00"
      #   speaker: sararobinson
      #   abstract:
      #     Coming soon

      - name: Continuous Integration for Machine Learning
        time: "17:00"
        speaker: elleobrien
        abstract:
          "Machine learning is maturing as a discipline: now that it’s trivially easy to create
          and train models, it’s never been more challenging to manage the complexity of experiments,
          changing datasets, and the demands of a full-stack project. In this talk, we’ll examine why
          one of the staples of DevOps, continuous integration, has been so challenging to implement
          in ML projects so far and how it can be done using open-source tools like Git, GitHub Actions,
          and DVC (Data Version Control).  We'll also discuss a new open source project
          (Continuous Machine Learning) created to adapt popular continuous integration systems like
          GitHub Actions and GitLab CI to data science projects."
