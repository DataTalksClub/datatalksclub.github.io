tracks:
  - name: Machine Learning Use Cases
    date: 2021-02-05
    eventbrite: 132703625115
    talks:
      - name: Industrial Applications of Reinforcement Learning
        time: "14:00" 
        speaker: philwinder
        abstract:
          Reinforcement learning (RL), a sub-discipline of machine learning,
          has been gaining academic and media notoriety after hyped marketing “reveals”
          of agents playing various games. But these hide the fact that RL is immensely useful
          in may practical, industrial situations where hand-coding strategies or policies would
          be impractical or sub-optimal.

          Following the theme of my new book (https://rl-book.com), I present a rebuttal to the
          hyperbole by analysing five different industrial case studies from a variety of sectors.
          You will learn where RL can be applied, how to spot challenges that fit inside the RL paradigm,
          and what pitfalls to watch out for. You will learn that RL is more than an bot in a game;
          it is the next frontier in applied artificial intelligence.

          I avoid using jargon to make this talk acceptable for a wider audience. I do expect that
          you have limited exposure to data science/machine learning in general.

      - name: How to use AI in Consumer Food Product Innovation
        time: "15:00" 
        speaker: himanshuupreti
        abstract:
          The way to do market research and create product concepts hasn't changed in decades in the
          CPG Industry. 9 out of every 10 products launched by CPG Industry fail in the first year
          itself. With such a high failure rate, no wonder the Industry is looking out for latest
          tech solutions. In this talk, I will try to demystify the process of product concept generation
          and how the latest advancements in AI are being leveraged to achieve the same. If you are someone
          who is interested in understanding the links between consumer understanding and technology,
          then this talk will be a treat for you.

      - name: Machine Learning in Manifacturing (TBA)
        time: "16:00"
        speaker: mahmoudaziz
        abstract:
          Coming soon

      - name: Applying ML to Healthcare
        time: "17:00"
        speaker: eugeneyan
        abstract:
          Coming soon

  - name: Product and Process
    date: 2021-02-12
    eventbrite: 132703715385
    talks:
      - name: "Building Data-Intense Teams"
        time: "14:00"
        speaker: eliasnema
        abstract:
          Nowadays, users expect your app to be not only fast and reliable but also smart.
          As a consequence, more and more teams are becoming data-intensive — relying on data
          to build their solutions. And it’s a common belief that putting models into production
          is one of the biggest bottlenecks in a journey of becoming more data-driven. While true,
          this step is only the beginning of the journey.

          I believe that a much broader transformation is required in how we think about product
          development lifecycle as well as communication flows between business, engineering and
          data.

          In this talk, I’ll show how we are building data-grounded solutions in the domain of
          search and recommendations and instilling an experimental culture in one of the biggest marketplaces.

      - name: Dangers of Dirty Data
        time: "15:00"
        speaker: susanwalsh
        abstract:
          "We all think we know what bad data looks like, but what is it and what are the consequences?

          Susan Walsh, The Classification Guru has spent nearly a decade classifying, normalising and cleansing spend data and will share real-life examples of dirty data, and the consequences it has on the output, such as decision making, reporting, analytics, AI and machine learning.

          She will share with you how to make quick, accurate checks and changes to your own data in excel, regardless of your level of experience, explain why data accuracy and maintenance is so important and implement best practices for this.
          
          Takeaways:

          <ul>
          <li>The importance of data accuracy</li>
          <li>The consequences of dirty data</li>
          <li>How to ensure data accuracy</li>
          <li>Make sure your data has its COAT on</li>
          <li>How to spot check your data</li>
          </ul>"
      - name: How Your ML Project Will Fail
        time: "16:00"
        speaker: elenasamuylova
        abstract:
          Coming soon

      - name: Translating ML Predictions Into Better Real-World Results with Decision Optimization
        time: "17:00"
        speaker: danbecker
        abstract:
          Machine learning models make predictions, but predictions are only useful to the extent
          they help us make better real-world decisions.

          For example, a model may predict that a financial transaction is 5% likely to be fraud.
          Should the transaction be approved, denied or delayed for further investigation? This
          decision requires further information and analysis.

          A few years ago, data scientists could build models and hope someone else would figure
          out how to translate predictions into decisions. That division of responsibility has generally
          been a failure, and now most companies expect data scientists to ensure their models lead to
          better decisions and better business results.

          Learn decision optimization techniques so you can consistently translate your models into
          better decisions and optimized business results.

  - name: Career in Data
    date: 2021-02-19
    eventbrite: 132703809667
    talks:
      - name: "The ABC’s of Data Science"
        time: "12:00"
        speaker: dannyma
        abstract:
          Coming soon

      - name: Personal Branding
        time: "13:30" 
        speaker: admondleekinlim
        abstract:
          Coming soon

      - name: Career Transitioning into Data Science
        time: "15:00"
        speaker: parulpandey
        abstract:
          Data Science is the art of making sense out of data. While we all agree that data should
          back all decisions, many of us still aren’t sure how to get the data to speak in the first
          place. Many people from varied backgrounds want to start on to their data science journey,
          but unfortunately face a lot of roadblocks. The sheer amount of materials and resources
          available online are more overwhelming than helping. There are thousands of books, papers,
          blogs, mentors and this doesn’t help. Beginners fail to devise a plan and hence cannot convert
          the theoretical knowledge into practical industry-based projects. If you are also sailing in the
          same boat, then this talk is for you. I’ll share my journey of how I switched to Data Science and
          share some industry experiences with you to create a balance between studying and execution.

      - name: New Roles and Key Skills to Monetize Machine Learning
        time: "16:00"
        speaker: vinvashishta
        abstract:
          We will discuss monetization roles and the capabilities people need to move into those roles.
          The key roles are ML Researcher, ML Architect, and ML Product Manager.

  - name: Machine Learning in Production
    date: 2021-02-26
    eventbrite: 131781966409
    talks:
      - name: 10 Foundational Practices of Machine Learning Engineering
        time: "14:00"
        speaker: larysavisengeriyeva
        abstract:
          he hype around Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence can give the illusion
          that software with integrated ML models is easy to develop. However, according to
          various studies, almost 80% of ML projects fail to get into production. In this talk,
          Larysa will present 10 fundamental practices for machine learning engineering to succeed
          in your own project.

      - name: Putting Data Science in Production
        time: "15:00"
        speaker: mikiobraun
        abstract:
          Every year, the number of tools that promise to take care of everything that's needed
          to put ML into production is growing, but which tool is really the right tool for the
          job and what does what? In this talk I'll be taking a look from the inside out,
          starting with an ML algorithm and gradually adding layers to give a bit of structure
          to this area. At the end, you probably have a better understanding what kinds of tools
          exist and what you need when.

      - name: Machine Learning Design Patterns
        time: "16:00"
        speaker: sararobinson
        abstract:
          Coming soon

      - name: Continuous Integration for Machine Learning
        time: "17:00"
        speaker: elleobrien
        abstract:
          "Machine learning is maturing as a discipline: now that it’s trivially easy to create
          and train models, it’s never been more challenging to manage the complexity of experiments,
          changing datasets, and the demands of a full-stack project. In this talk, we’ll examine why
          one of the staples of DevOps, continuous integration, has been so challenging to implement
          in ML projects so far and how it can be done using open-source tools like Git, GitHub Actions,
          and DVC (Data Version Control).  We'll also discuss a new open source project
          (Continuous Machine Learning) created to adapt popular continuous integration systems like
          GitHub Actions and GitLab CI to data science projects."
