Denis Rothman graduated from Sorbonne University and Paris-Diderot University, patenting one of the very first word2matrix embedding solutions. Denis Rothman is the author of three cutting-edge AI solutions: one of the first AI cognitive chatbots more than 30 years ago; a profit-orientated AI resource optimizing system; and an AI APS (Advanced Planning and Scheduling) solution based on cognitive patterns used worldwide in aerospace, rail, energy, apparel, and many other fields. Designed initially as a cognitive AI bot for IBM, it then went on to become a robust APS solution used to this day.
