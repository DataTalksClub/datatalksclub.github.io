Ertuğrul Mutlu is a Computer Engineering student at RWTH Aachen University and a Werkstudent Researcher at Fraunhofer IAIS (Enterprise Information Systems). His work spans reliable AI systems, agentic workflows, applied LLM engineering, and signal‑processing‑based feature extraction. He focuses on building practical, lightweight AI systems that bridge classical methods with modern LLM‑driven agent architectures. He recently published a preprint on wavelet‑based feature engineering and clustering, writes technical articles on dev.to about ML systems and agentic AI, and actively contributes to the open‑source and data/ML community through prototypes, research notes, and talks.
