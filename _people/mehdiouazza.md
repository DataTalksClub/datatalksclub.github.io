I’m a data geek entrepreneur who’s passionate about Big data, Data science, Web App and Music. With more than 7 years of experience, I got the opportunity to work on multiple aspect regarding data engineering, that includes data pipelines (stream/batch), data modeling, orchestration, infrastructure and from time to time analytical reports using dashboarding tools.

I always keep my feet on the ground and take some times to do technology watch: continuous learning is my motto. I’m also a startup entrepreneur, meetup lover and blogger: sharing is caring.
