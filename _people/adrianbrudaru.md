I studied economics in Romania but soon got bored with how creative the industry was, and chose to go instead for the more factual side.

I ended up in Berlin at the age of 25 and started a role as a business analyst. At the age of 30, I had enough of startups and decided to join a corporation, but quickly found out that it did not provide the challenge I wanted.

As going back to startups was not a desirable option either, I decided to postpone decision by taking freelance work. I since never looked back, and now, 5 years later, I am co-founding a company in the data space so I can try new things. This company is also looking to release a bunch of open source tooling (the kind we use ourselves) to help democratise data engineering.
