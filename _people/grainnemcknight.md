Data Scientist in Berlin ❤️. Worked for past years in fintech on building data products including a customer service chatbot, a geolocation service and models for money laundering and fraud detection and am now working on exciting new things at Spoke. Bayesian at heart, and always happy to chat about reinforcement learning, network science and ML ops.
