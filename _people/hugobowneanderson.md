I'm a data scientist, writer, educator & podcaster. My interests include promoting data & AI literacy/fluency, helping to spread data skills through organizations and society and doing amateur stand up comedy in NYC. I do many of these at DataCamp, a data science training company educating over 3 million learners worldwide through interactive courses on the use of Python, R, SQL, Git, Bash and Spreadsheets in a data science context. I have spearheaded the development of over 25 courses in DataCampâ€™s Python curriculum, impacting over 170,000 learners worldwide through my own courses. I host and produce the data science podcast DataFramed, in which I use long-format interviews with working data scientists to delve into what actually happens in the space and what impact it can and does have. I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the University of New South Wales, Australia and have conducted biomedical research at the Max Planck Institute in Germany and Yale University, New Haven.
