I am a Consulting Architect in Red Hat and focus on bringing business value through IT and collaboration. I also have an interest in Machine Learning and love to bring the discipline of Software Engineering to Machine Learning projects.

I am currently living in Australia and worked in North America, Asia, and Australia. I am a father of two girls, so naturally, unicorns are my favorite creatures.

I blog at https://developers.redhat.com/blog/author/fmasoodredhat-com/ and my GitHub URL is https://github.com/masoodfaisal.
