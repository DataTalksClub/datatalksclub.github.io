Santiago is a Computer Scientist focusing on applied Machine Learning.
He has more than two decades of experience building software to solve exciting and —sometimes— hard problems.

He cares deeply about unlocking the power of technology for individuals and businesses,
so they can use computers in a way that was previously unrealistic for them.
He finds joy in ambiguity and feels more engaged when working on problems that
can't be solved by merely searching the web or reading a book.
Bonus points if he can collaborate with a team of like-minded engineers!
