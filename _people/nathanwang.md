Nathan Wang is the Director of Data Science & Analytics at Twilio Segment, where he has been having a ball of a time harnessing Segment’s Customer Data Platform to build data products that help go-to-market partners drive positive business outcomes.

Prior to Segment, Nathan spent three years on the Data Science & Analytics team at Opendoor where he worked on pricing optimization and risk mitigation. Perhaps somewhat unusually, Nathan started his career as a Macroeconomist, but then decided that instead of passively describing how ‘total factor productivity’ had been stagnating, that he should be part of the real economy and become a growth-driver.

Outside of work, Nathan enjoys traveling and going on new adventures with his wife and two-year-old son.
