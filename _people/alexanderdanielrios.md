Alexander Daniel Rios is about to graduate with a degree in Electronic Engineering from Universidad Tecnológica Nacional (UTN – FRBA), a public engineering university in Buenos Aires. It was through ML Zoomcamp program that he first discovered my passion for programming and data science, which led me to explore the world of Python, machine learning, and data-driven problem solving. He has been a Python developer for over 7 years, and for the past 3 years, he has been focused on applying data science techniques to real-world challenges. He is now transitioning into a role as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.
