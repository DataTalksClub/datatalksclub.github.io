I'm product-focused analytics leader with data science background. I'm passionate about AB testing, defining metrics that help products grow and how to make the best pizza dough. I have 3+ years experience in leading and growing analytics teams, have scaled teams from scratch to 8 people. As a leader I try to lead by example and encourage team members to become independent and think for themselves. I love seeing people grow and am thankful for being part of the journey.
