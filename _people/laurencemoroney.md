I’m Laurence Moroney — a Developer Advocate at Google specializing in Firebase, Google Maps
and a bit of Google Cloud. I’m host of the YouTube show ‘Coffee with a Googler’, a popular
interview show that puts a human face on many of the roles that people take inside this wonderful company!

I’m the author of lots of books, including the upcoming Definitive Guide to Firebase from Apress,
the popular ‘Legend of the Locust‘ Young Adult Sci-Fi series, and the prequel to the movie
‘Equilibrium’, starring Christian Bale!
