Rosona Eldred is a trained mathematician working in the “data space” for the last 6 years, the last three with industrial data. She is currently a machine learning engineer with a technical leadership role around synthetic tabular data in an AI Innovation team.  
She’s particularly intrigued by Industrial R&D problems, especially around dealing with tiny data.  

Originally from the US, after finishing her Ph.D., she moved to Germany in 2012 as a postdoctoral researcher and has stayed there ever since.  If the ampel coalition ever finishes the debate over dual citizenship, she’ll officially become German.
