I am a data scientist at SAP, passionate about bringing the full potential of current machine learning research to business applications. I am interested in creative combinations of statistical and machine learning methods for use cases addressing real-world problems. In my PhD dissertation, I created an applied machine learning framework for churn prediction, enhanced by organisational trust theory and explainable machine learning methods.
