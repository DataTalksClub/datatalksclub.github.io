Rob is a developer advocate at Iterative AI. He’s got a background in information sciences, and experience in data analytics and engineering. Previously he worked in FinTech, and right now he’s learning a whole lot about MLOps. He’s got first-hand experience with the gap between data scientists and engineers, and particularly interested in bridging that gap.
