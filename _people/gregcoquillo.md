My passion for solving business use cases, such as Price Optimization for commodity-based products has led me to deep dive into the world of Artificial Intelligence. As a Technology Manager at Amazon, I own a roadmap that drives the adoption of AI products that support Private Brands' Product Safety and Compliance. I work with Data Scientists, Software Engineers and Business Intelligence Engineers to leverage Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics to design predictive models that enhance business decision-making and performance to accelerate growth, reduce Time to Market of products, monitor cross-geo compliance and import requirements, and ensure customer safety.
