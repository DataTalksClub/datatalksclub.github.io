Nataliya received her Doctoral Degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Waterloo in 2010, followed by postdoctoral training at the Neurological Institute in Montreal. Following her postdoctoral assignment, she developed a novel approach to brain tissue classification in early childhood brain MRIs using modern Computer Vision pattern recognition and perceptual image quality models. Nataliya has worked in many industries including neuroscience, biotech, the public sector, and various start-up software companies. Throughout her career, she has applied her expertise in Mathematics to develop numerous models including but not limited to machine learning algorithms, computationally efficient algorithms for model validation, and neural networks. She is the co-inventor of “Bid-Assist”, a strategy for setting up an initial bidding amount to discourage low bidding behaviour, and “AutoVision”, a mobile app that allows automatic taking of pictures of vehicle views and damages recognized by an image classifier. Nataliya paved a new way for Data Science in incentives industry. She developed predictive analytics tools that help channel leaders maximize the return on investment of their channel incentive programs. In January 2021, Nataliya joined the Cineplex Digital Media as a Senior Data Scientist committed to the development of media content recommendation systems.
