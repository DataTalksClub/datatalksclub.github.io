In 2022 I decided to open Hiire - my first real business - focusing on helping companies to hire better and faster every single day without forgetting an amazing candidate experience. 100% digital because I will be travelling the world while I'm expanding Hiire and helping international companies.

I worked for companies like Feedzai, Mercedes-Benz.io, Adyen and Trengo. Hired +500 IT professionals (from Software Engineers to CTOs),  and coached recruitment teams to help them go to their next level in Portugal, Germany, Netherlands and Singapore.

Since 2020 I’ve been actively helping great professionals find better jobs and different career paths with personalised coaching programs.
