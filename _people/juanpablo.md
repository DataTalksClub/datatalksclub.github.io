Juan Pablo Murillo is a math teacher turned analytics engineer. He currently works for Amazon and previously worked for T-Mobile. Aside from work, JP is an industry mentor with the MS in Information Systems at the University of Washington, where he helps students crack their first data role. He is also active on Twitter, where he shares content on how to break into data analytics. He attended Sonoma State University (BA) and the University of Iowa (MS) for degrees in mathematics.

Aside from work, I like to go hiking and cooking. I’m also a big fan of football (soccer) and I’m looking forward to the next World Cup.
