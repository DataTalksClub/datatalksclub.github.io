I am a PhD candidate in neurobiology and behavior at UC Irvine studying the neural correlates of facial recognition. I first became interested in neuroscience in high school, realizing it was the marriage of my two favorite subjects – biology and psychology. Since then, I’ve spent a rewarding decade-plus learning about the brain. I started at UC San Diego’s Cognitive Science department, studying the mind through biological, anthropological, philosophical, and computational perspectives. This interdisciplinary training primed my current research on the neurological intersection of facial recognition with social and perceptual aspects of race.
