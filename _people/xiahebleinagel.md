From full-time stay-at-home mom to Head of Data & Cloud, my journey has been one of clear goals, continuous learning, and resilience.

As a Data Generalist turned Data Leader, my expertise spans machine learning, NLP, data engineering, and AWS cloud architecture, and now extends to helping organizations build impactful Data & AI strategies that drive real business value.

Iâ€™m passionate about coaching and mentoring, especially supporting women returning to work or entrepreneur journey.
My leadership style combines technical depth, strategic vision, and empathy,  empowering teams to grow and perform at their best.
