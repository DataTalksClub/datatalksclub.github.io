Orell graduated in 2018 with a degree in Electrical Engineering, where he focused on simulation algorithms. He then began a PhD, but when COVID arrived, he decided to leave academia and look for new challenges. After that, he joined a government-funded startup program to explore how to turn scientific research into real products. Although that project didnâ€™t go as planned, it taught him what he loves most: applying rigorous simulation methods to solve practical problems.
