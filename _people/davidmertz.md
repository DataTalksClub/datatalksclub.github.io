David is founder of KDM Training, a partnership dedicated to educating developers and data
scientists in machine learning and scientific computing.  He created the data science training
program for Anaconda Inc. and was a senior trainer for them.  With the advent of deep neural
networks he has turned to training our robot overlords as well.
He was honored to work for 8 years with D. E. Shaw Research, who have built the world's fastest,
highly-specialized (down to the ASICs and network layer), supercomputer for performing molecular
dynamics.
David was a Director of the PSF for six years, and remains co-chair of its Trademarks
Committee and of its Scientific Python Working Group.  His columns, Charming Python and
XML Matters, written in the 2000s, were the most widely read articles in the Python world.
He has written previous books for Packt, O'Reilly and Addison-Wesley, and has given keynote
addresses at numerous international programming conferences.
