Agostino is a Senior Data Scientist at Shopify who has a background in ecommerce and fintech. While now working for a pioneer in ecommerce, he previously worked for N26 while the company went from a small start-up to one of Germany's biggest banks. During his time in both companies, he gained a lot of knowledge on how to standardize processes for ML development in fast-growing companies and organizations that contain more than 300 data scientists. His interest in delivering high quality while repeatedly building ML models fast, led to the fact that he created his own framework on how to develop models.
