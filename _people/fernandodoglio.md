Fernando Doglio has been working as a Web Developer for the past 10 years. In that time, he's come to love the web and has had the opportunity of working with most of the leading technologies at the time, such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Node. js, Angular.js, AJAX, REST APIs, and others.

In his spare time, he likes to tinker and learn new things, which is why his Github account keeps getting new repos every month.

He can be contacted on Twitter at: @deleteman123 or you can read more about him and his work at www.fdoglio.com

When not programming, he can be seen spending time with his family.
