Rob Zinkov is a machine learning engineer and data scientist. My work covers how to more efficiently specify and train deep generative models as well as how to more effectively discover a good statistical model for your data. Previously I was a research scientist at Indiana University where I was the lead developer of the Hakaru probabilistic programming language.
