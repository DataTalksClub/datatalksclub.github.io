​I'm an e-commerce Product Owner with a focus on site search optimization, analytics, team management, and product development. I work on creating better user experiences and boosting conversion rates by implementing features like autocomplete, and search filters, and improving site speed.

​I collaborate with developers, QA, BA, backend, frontend, analytics, and UX designers. My communication skills and experience in project management help me get projects done efficiently and successfully.

​As a product manager, I develop roadmaps and strategies that align with the goals of the business and the needs of customers. I'm skilled in Python, SQL, Google Sheets, and Power BI, which help me analyze data and track performance metrics. I'm also familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Figma, allowing me to contribute to a variety of projects in e-commerce.
