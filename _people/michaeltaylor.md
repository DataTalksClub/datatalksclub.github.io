I graduated with a masterâ€™s degree in Economics, then worked across a number of growth roles at startups, before co-founding a marketing agency and growing it to 50 people. After exiting I created courses on LinkedIn and Udemy taken by over 350,000 people, wrote a self-published book called Marketing Memetics, and a book for O'Reilly on Prompt Engineering for Generative AI. Today, I'm focused on building AI products through Brightpool.
