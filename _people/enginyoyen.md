I am
a Software Engineer, dad, humble home chef (emphasis on humble), motorcycle enthusiast, and currently living the Berlin life with my wife and our two tiny humans.

I did
dabble in everything from the Internet of Things to Telecommunications, Smart Classrooms, CMS platforms, and more. So yes — I do build software. I’ve even done it at places you might’ve heard of… like Microsoft and eBay. (Name drop: achieved.)

I do
co-founded trustpath.io — we’re in the cybersecurity biz, stopping fraud before it even thinks about happening. We like to think of it as digital crime-fighting, minus the capes.

I have
a background with everything but the kitchen sink: Computer Science + Psychology (yes, really), Business Administration, and a Master’s in Embedded Software Engineering.

I like
tinkering with tech, writing things (sometimes just to see if anyone’s reading), experimenting with new ideas, and learning weird, wonderful stuff no one asked for — but someone, someday, might need.
