Martin Kleppmann is a researcher in distributed systems at the University of Cambridge.
Previously he was a software engineer and entrepreneur at Internet companies including
LinkedIn and Rapportive, where he worked on large-scale data infrastructure. In the process
he learned a few things the hard way, and he hopes this book will save you from repeating
the same mistakes.

Martin is a regular conference speaker, blogger, and open source contributor. He believes
that profound technical ideas should be accessible to everyone, and that deeper understanding
will help us develop better software.
