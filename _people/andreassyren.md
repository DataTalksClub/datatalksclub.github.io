Andreas Syrén is a Principal Applied Scientist at Zalando. He found his love for mathematics while studying Mechatronics Engineering, pivoting into a master's in Engineering Mathematics & Computational Science at Chalmers University of Technology - before heading into industry. "I am passionate about the Applied part of Applied Science. Massive impact is out there whenever we can successfully apply scientific methodology with real-world outcomes. But for that to happen we need much more than only theory - from an engineering mindset; to people, product, and sales." In his free time, you can find him with his friends playing TTRPGs, doing some kind of boardsport, or reading up on some non-applied area of mathematics.
