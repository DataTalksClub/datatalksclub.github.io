Anusha is the co-founder of Aurelytix, an AI-driven finance platform built to give CFOs and finance teams clarity and speed without adding complexity.

She is Alumni of CIMA, UK ,after almost a decade in corporate finance strategy and transformation, leading ERP implementations and major finance change programs at companies like Deloitte, Parexel, Survitec, Chubb,  she grew frustrated with data silos & slow, fragmented tools that keep enterprises & SMEs reactive instead of strategic.

In 2025 she launched Aurelytix to change that: building Insight Pulse, an AI-powered decision layer that spots anomalies, explains variances, and surfaces opportunities while keeping a human firmly in the loop.
Sheâ€™s passionate about augmented finance using AI to supercharge decision-making while respecting compliance and trust, especially under GDPR in Europe.
