Ondřej Bothe has spent his whole life working in analytics. He has worked in many different roles: from hands-on developer to manager leading a team responsible for project implementation and IT analytical landscape operation. He was on the customer side, receiving advice from a consultant, but he has also worn the consultant hat, advising clients on analytical issues across sectors. Thanks to his economic background, he has a unique view of analytical projects. He can combine the aspect of technology, the delivery approach, and an understanding of data with an economist’s perspective to ensure the best possible results for analytical insight consumers.
