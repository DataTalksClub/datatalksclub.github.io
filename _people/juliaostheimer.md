After starting my work career as a Project Manager, I have been doing a deep dive into the world of artificial intelligence. My thesis focused on human-in-the-loop computing, a machine learning approach to achieving high-accuracy algorithms by combining machine intelligence with human domain expertise. Since then, I have been working & volunteering in the field of Data Science & Machine Learning, always interested to learn and applying new knowledge of AI and ML research.
