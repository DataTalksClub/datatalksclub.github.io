My aspiration is to provide the often-missing link between data and decision-making. After a long career in web/app development and entrepreneurship, I realized my passion lay in the ability to turn large amounts of information into knowledge, to identify patterns, to uncover relationships, to solve problems, and to formulate predictions.

To that end, although I had been making models and engaging with data for almost two decades, four years ago I decided to go back to school to get a graduate degree in data science. Since then I have been providing that link, by combining my extensive experience in computer science, data science, decision science, and business thinking.
