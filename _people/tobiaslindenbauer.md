​Tobias Lindenbauer is an AI researcher at JetBrains Research, where he advances efficient and effective code agents that robustly solve long-horizon software engineering tasks. Currently, he is most interested in efficiency topics, context management, interpretability and data synthesis. He recently presented “The Complexity Trap: Simple Observation Masking Is as Efficient as LLM Summarization for Agent Context Management” at the Deep Learning for Code workshop at NeurIPS 2025, highlighting practical pitfalls of LLM summarization-based context strategies and evidence for more computationally efficient alternatives.
