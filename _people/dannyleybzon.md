Danny D. Leybzon has worn many hats, all of them related to data. He studied computational statistics at UCLA, before becoming first an analyst and then a product manager at a big data platform named Qubole. He went on to be the primary field engineer for data science and machine learning at Imply, before taking on his current role as MLOps Architect at WhyLabs. He has worked to evangelize machine learning best practices, talking on subjects such as distributed deep learning, productionizing machine learning models, automated machine learning, and lately has been talking about AI observability and data logging. When Danny's not researching, practicing, or talking about data science, he's usually doing one of his numerous outside hobbies: rock climbing, backcountry backpacking, skiing, etc.
