Anthony Virtuoso works as a Principal Engineer at Amazon and holds multiple patents in distributed systems, software defined networks, and security. In his eight years at Amazon, he has helped launch several Amazon Web Services, the most recent of which was Amazon Managed Blockchain. As one of the original authors of Athena Query Federation, you'll often find him lurking on the Athena Federation GitHub repository answering questions and shipping bug fixes. When not at work, Anthony obsesses over a different set of customers, namely his wife and two little boys, aged 2 and 5. His kids enjoy doing science experiments with dad, like 3D printing toys, building with Lego, or searching the local pond for tardigrades.
