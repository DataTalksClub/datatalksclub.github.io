Andrew Jones is a Principal Engineer at GoCardless, one of Europe's leading Fintechs. He has over 15 years’ experience in the industry, with the first half primarily as a software engineer before moving into the data infrastructure and data engineering space.

Joining GoCardless as its first data engineer, he led his team to build their data platform from scratch. After initially following a typical data architecture and getting frustrated with facing the same old challenges we’ve faced for years, he started thinking there must be a better way, which led to him coining and defining the ideas around “data contracts”.

Andrew is a regular speaker and writer, and passionate about helping organizations get the most value from data.
