In 2012, Doug saw search relevance would be central to user experiences. Sadly, search relevance
was a topic clouded esoteric mystery. Doug began to democratize this daunting field through blogging
and speaking. In 2016, Doug's book [Relevant Search](https://www.manning.com/books/relevant-search){:target="_blank"}
woke the industry up to the importance of search quality. Doug now works at Shopify, working to make
great commerce search+discovery possible for everyone. Doug co-created [Elasticsearch Learning to
Rank](https://elasticsearch-learning-to-rank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){:target="_blank"} with the Wikimedia Foundation
and contributed to Trey Grainger's upcoming [AI Powered Search](http://aipoweredsearch.com){:target="_blank"}.
