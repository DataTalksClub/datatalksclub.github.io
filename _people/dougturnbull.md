I love mentoring and leading search teams, writing about technology, building new search capabilities, and pushing the boundaries of applied information retrieval. I wrote Relevant Search (http://manning.com/books/relevant-search) and formerly worked at OpenSource Connections (http://opensourceconnections.com)
