Experienced in Business Intelligence, IoT architecture, Big Data development, and Data Science & Machine Learning, throughout my career, I've been leading state of the art projects not only in major companies, such as Vodafone, but also startups. My BSc in Applied Maths, MSc in Data Science combined with PyTorch Secure and Private AI Nanodegrees, that empowers me to have the knowledge and understanding of data's whole lifecycle and how companies can implement artificial intelligence. Moreover, data privacy is one of my major concerns and fields of research, as well as deep learning techniques.

Currently focused and making data available for data scientists as YData's co-founder.
