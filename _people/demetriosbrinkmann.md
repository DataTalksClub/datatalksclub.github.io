Demetrios is constantly creating as he tries to navigate this thing we call life. 
He has recently moved to the countryside in Germany after spending the last 10 years in the Basque Country.

In April 2020 he fell into leading the MLOps community which aims to bring clarity around the
operational side of Machine Learning. Since diving into the nitty gritty of Machine Learning he has felt
a strong calling to explore the ethical issues surrounding the new tech he covers.

The MLOps community is the largest and most active community boasting over 2500 slack members and
25k youtube views of videos on various ML Operations themes. Various experts from all over the world
come together daily to assist one another on current obstacles or share their vision of the landscape at large.
