Pastor Soto is a Machine Learning Engineer and mentor with a practical bias toward shipping. While studying medicine at the university, he took on side work that pulled him into machine learning. The inflection point was ML Zoomcamp: by publishing exercises and projects publicly, he attracted interviews and job offers.

Pastor’s work centers on production ML: moving data, wiring APIs, and feeding LLMs so applications run. He mentors with DeepLearning.AI, leads sections for Stanford’s Code in Place, and writes about focused learning and small, finished steps that compound.
