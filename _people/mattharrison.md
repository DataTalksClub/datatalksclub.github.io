Matt Harrison is a corporate trainer, consultant, and author who has worked with various startups architecting data science, business intelligence, storage, open source stack support, search and high availability. My posts tend to be on subjects related to these. I also might post on my hobbies, which include frisbee (mostly ultimate and goaltimate), gardening, and outdoor activities (skiing, trail running, hiking, climbing, biking, etc). I have a computer science degree from Stanford.
