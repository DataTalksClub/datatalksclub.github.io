I am a Software Engineer working with the Kedro team at QuantumBlack. Before I joined the Kedro team I worked on our in-house experiment and model performance tracking tool. During my career as software engineer I've developed tools in various languages (Java, Scala, and Python), for various use cases from social networking for academia to targeted advertising. Iâ€™ve always been interested in machine learning and love contributing to the space from a software engineering perspective. I really enjoy creating things and helping others.
