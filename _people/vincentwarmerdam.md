Currently Vincent works as a Research Advocate at Rasa where he collaborates with the research
team to explain and understand conversational systems better. One of his activities is maintaining
a youtube playlist that explains NLP algorithms over at "the algorithm whiteboard". Before, he
was a consultant working on production algorithms for a large range of companies.

Vincent is a firm believer in open source and certainly doesn't mind to evangalise from time
to time. He has a blog about the slightly less obvious aspects in the world of data science
over at https://koaning.io. He's also working on a project that tries to help people get started
over at https://calmcode.io.

The future is pretty awesome, all we have to do is build it.
