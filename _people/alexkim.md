Most of Alexâ€™s work experience involved solving data science problems in various domains: physics, aerospace, telemetry/log analytics, image, and video processing.

In the last couple of years, he became increasingly interested in the engineering side of ML projects: processes and tools needed to go from an idea to a production solution. Currently, he works as an MLOps Solutions Engineer at Iterative.ai, helping customers extract the most value from the Iterative ecosystem of tools.
