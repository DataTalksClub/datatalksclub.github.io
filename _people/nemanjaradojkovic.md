Nemanja, originally from Belgrade, Serbia, has been living in Leuven, Belgium since 2014. His professional journey spans from being an Electrical Engineer to transitioning into roles as a Data Scientist and MLOps Engineer. Despite dropping out of a Ph.D. program, Nemanja has diverse experience as a former salesman and consultant in both Big4 and boutique firms. Alongside his main roles, he engages in teaching Data Science, Machine Learning, and Python programming, contributing two courses to DataCamp. In 2011, he humorously mentions being "bit by a radioactive Python." Outside of work, Nemanja holds a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and is a proud father of three.
