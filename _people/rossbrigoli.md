I am a consulting architect at Red Hat focused on delivering cutting-edge solutions to enterprises. I am originally from the Philippines. I have previously worked in the UK and France and am currently living in Singapore.

I am a father of a little girl who loves dinosaurs. That makes me an expert in dinosaurs too.

I write about different topics, mostly hacks, and DIY projects, on my blog: https://blog.rossbrigoli.com.
