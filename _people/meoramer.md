My journey into AI began in 2010 after my son was born with a limb difference. I became interested in machine learning in prosthetics and did an MSc at Imperial College London majoring in neurotechnology.

I have also worked in the telecoms data analytics space, where I did solution engineering for clients in over 15 countries.

Above all, I am passionate about education and how we learn. I am currently working on projects that explore ways to create alternative learning experiences using visuals, storytelling, and games.
