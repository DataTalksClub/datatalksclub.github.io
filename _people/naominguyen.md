A machine learning practitioner with emphasis on model evaluation and imbalance class problem. Unusual events, model overfitting, and outdated modeling due to changing underlying distribution of new data are some of my top area of concern. I'm always a fast and curious learner, an eager problem-solver, and a believer in communication, transparency, and constructive criticism.

I enjoy teaching mathematics and statistics as well as having discussions on new fields.
