- question: "What is the MLOps Zoomcamp?"
  answer: |
    The MLOps Zoomcamp is a free, community-driven program by [DataTalks.Club](/) that teaches core MLOps skills through hands-on project work.
    
    This 3-month course covers a comprehensive [curriculum](#course-curriculum) with all materials open and available anytime on [GitHub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp). You'll work with an industry-standard stack including MLflow, Docker, AWS, Prometheus, Grafana, Mage, and GitHub Actions and earn a [certificate](#can-i-get-a-certificate).

- question: "What does zoomcamp mean?"
  answer: |
    "Zoomcamp" is a term that originated from [Alexey Grigorev](/people/alexeygrigorev.html), the founder of DataTalks.Club. It started with his book "ML Bookcamp." When Alexey decided to create a video course based on the book, he called it "[Machine Learning Zoomcamp](/blog/machine-learning-zoomcamp.html)" - a free, cohort-based course in video format. The name "zoomcamp" is a play on "bookcamp," referring to the video format of the course. The Zoomcamp series has since expanded to include other free courses like the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](/blog/data-engineering-zoomcamp.html), [MLOps Zoomcamp](/blog/mlops-zoomcamp.html), and [LLM Zoomcamp](/blog/llm-zoomcamp.html), all following the same community-driven, open-source philosophy.

- question: "Is it really free?"
  answer: |
    Yes, the MLOps Zoomcamp is completely free. There are no hidden costs, no tuition fees, and no paid tiers. All course materials, videos, homework assignments, and access to the [community](#what-is-the-datatalksclub-mlops-community) are provided at no cost. Unlike traditional bootcamps that charge $10,000-$20,000+, this course is entirely community-driven and open source.

- question: "How does the MLOps Zoomcamp compare to traditional MLOps bootcamps?"
  answer: |
    The MLOps Zoomcamp differs from traditional MLOps bootcamps in several key ways:

    1. **Cost**: Completely free vs. $10,000-$20,000+ for bootcamps
