- question: "What does zoomcamp mean?"
  answer: |
    "Zoomcamp" is a term that originated from [Alexey Grigorev](/people/alexeygrigorev.html), the founder of DataTalks.Club. It started with his book "ML Bookcamp." When Alexey decided to create a video course based on the book, he called it "[Machine Learning Zoomcamp](/blog/machine-learning-zoomcamp.html)" - a free, cohort-based course in video format. The name "zoomcamp" is a play on "bookcamp," referring to the video format of the course. The Zoomcamp series has since expanded to include other free courses like the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](/blog/data-engineering-zoomcamp.html), [MLOps Zoomcamp](/blog/mlops-zoomcamp.html), [LLM Zoomcamp](/blog/llm-zoomcamp.html), and [AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp](/blog/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp.html), all following the same community-driven, open-source philosophy.

- question: "Is AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp 2025 free?"
  answer: |
    Yes! The AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp is completely free. There are no hidden costs, no tuition fees, and no paid tiers. All course materials, videos, homework assignments, and access to the [Slack community](/slack.html) are provided at no cost. Unlike traditional bootcamps that charge $10,000-$20,000+, this course is entirely community-driven and open source.

- question: "What programming experience do I need for AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp?"

No prior experience with AI tools is required - we'll teach you everything you need to know about using AI in development workflows. The course is designed for developers who want to explore how AI tools fit into their workflow, engineers aiming to boost productivity with coding assistants, agents, and automation, and learners who prefer project-based practice over theory-heavy tutorials.

- question: "How long does AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp 2025 take to complete?"
  answer: |
    Each module includes hands-on projects, so the time commitment depends on your learning style and how much time you can dedicate. Most learners spend around 2 weeks to complete each module. With 6 modules total, expect to spend approximately 5-15 hours per week, depending on your background. This includes watching videos, completing homework, and working on [the final project](#building-your-project-portfolio). More time may be needed during the final project weeks.

- question: "Do I need to install specific AI tools for this course?"
  answer: |
    We'll guide you through setting up and using various AI tools throughout the course, including GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and n8n. Some tools may require subscriptions, but we'll focus on free or low-cost options where possible. The course covers essential AI development tools and platforms that you'll learn to integrate into real developer workflows.

- question: "How do I get the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp certificate?"
  answer: |
    To earn a certificate, you'll need to complete a final project that demonstrates practical application of the concepts learned throughout the course. The project is submitted for peer review to ensure quality and understanding. After submitting your project, you must also review at least 3 other students' projects by the deadline and provide constructive feedback.

We also have an [FAQ repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq) with answers to common questions and a @ZoomcampQABot in Slack for quick help.

- question: "What makes AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp different from other AI courses?"
  answer: |
    This course focuses specifically on integrating AI tools into real developer workflows, not just theory. You'll build complete projects using AI assistants, create your own coding agents, and automate workflows - giving you practical, job-relevant skills. The course is designed with developer workflows in mind. By the end, you won't just know what Copilot, Cursor, or n8n are; you'll have used them to build complete projects and integrate them into real processes. Unlike many AI courses that focus on theory or chatbot development, AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp teaches you to use AI tools to actually ship software faster.

- question: "When does the next cohort of the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp start?"
  answer: |
    The next cohort of the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp starts on November 18, 2025. Register here: [https://airtable.com/appJRFiWKHBgmEt70/shrpw7rk55Ewr1jCG](https://airtable.com/appJRFiWKHBgmEt70/shrpw7rk55Ewr1jCG) before the course starts.

- question: "Who runs the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp?"
  answer: |
    The AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp is run by [DataTalks.Club](/), a global online community of data professionals and learners. While the initial idea and most of the content were created by [Alexey Grigorev](/people/alexeygrigorev.html), members of the DataTalks.Club community contribute as instructors and maintainers.
    
    DataTalks.Club is often referred to as "the DataTalks Club", "data talks club", or "datatalks club".

- question: "Can I take the course in self-paced mode?"
  answer: |
    Yes! All course materials, videos, and recordings remain available after the cohort ends, and you can learn at your own pace. You'll have access to the [Slack community](/slack.html) for support. However, self-paced learning does not include homework submissions, project evaluations, or the ability to earn a [certificate](#can-i-get-a-certificate). To receive a certificate, you need to join an active cohort.

- question: "Can I get a certificate in self-paced mode?"
  answer: |
    No, certificates are only available when completing the course with a live cohort. Self-paced mode does not include homework submissions, project evaluations, or certificates. This is because the certification process requires you to review three projects, and these peer reviews only happen during the active course period. Additionally, the submission form closes after the peer-review list is compiled. Self-paced learners can access all course materials and the Slack community, but must join a live cohort to earn a certificate.

- question: "Where is the GitHub repository?"
  answer: |
    The GitHub repository is [https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp).
