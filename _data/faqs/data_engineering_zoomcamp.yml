- question: "What is the Data Engineering Zoomcamp?"
  answer: |
    The Data Engineering Zoomcamp is a free, community-driven program by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/) that teaches core data engineering skills through [hands-on projects](#building-your-portfolio-with-data-engineering-projects).
    
    This data engineering course has a 9-week [curriculum](#course-curriculum) and all the materials are open and available any time on the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp GitHub repo](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp). You'll work with an industry-standard stack including Docker, Terraform, dbt, Spark, Kafka, and BigQuery and earn a [certificate](#how-does-the-data-engineering-zoomcamp-certificate-work).

- question: "Is it really free?"
  answer: |
    Yes, the Data Engineering Zoomcamp is completely free. There are no hidden costs, no tuition fees, and no paid tiers. All course materials, videos, homework assignments, and access to the [community](#datatalksclub-community-and-support) are provided at no cost. Unlike traditional bootcamps that charge $10,000-$20,000+, this course is entirely community-driven and open source.

- question: "How does the Data Engineering Zoomcamp compare to traditional data engineering bootcamps?"
  answer: |
    The Data Engineering Zoomcamp differs significantly from traditional data engineering bootcamps in several key ways.

    1. **Cost**: While bootcamps typically cost $10,000-$20,000+, the Data Engineering Zoomcamp has no tuition fees whatsoever.
    2. **Community**: The Data Engineering Zoomcamp is community-driven and open source. All materials remain available forever on GitHub, unlike bootcamps that lock content behind paywalls.
    3. **Flexibility**: You can continue at your own pace even after the cohort ends, whereas bootcamps usually have rigid schedules and limited access periods.

- question: "How does the Data Engineering Zoomcamp certificate work?"
  answer: |
    To earn your Data Engineering Zoomcamp [certificate](#how-does-the-data-engineering-zoomcamp-certificate-work), you need to complete the [project requirements](#building-your-portfolio-with-data-engineering-projects) by building an end-to-end data pipeline.

    After submitting your project, you must also participate in peer learning by reviewing at least 3 other projects, submitting reviews by the deadline, and providing constructive feedback.

- question: "When does the next cohort of the DE Zoomcamp start?"

    No prior data engineering experience is needed. You should be comfortable with the command line and have basic SQL knowledge. Python experience is helpful but not required.

- question: "How much time should I expect to spend?"
  answer: |
    You should expect to spend between 5-15 hours per week, depending on your background. This includes watching videos, completing homework, and working on [projects](#building-your-portfolio-with-data-engineering-projects). More time might be needed during project weeks. The time commitment varies based on your familiarity with the tools and concepts.

- question: "Can I take the course in self-paced mode?"
  answer: |
    Yes! All course materials, videos, and recordings remain available after the cohort ends, and you can learn at your own pace. You'll have access to the Slack community for support, where you can search previous discussions or ask @ZoomcampQABot for help. However, please note that self-paced learning does not include homework submissions, project evaluations, or the ability to earn a [certificate](#how-does-the-data-engineering-zoomcamp-certificate-work). To receive a certificate, you need to join an active cohort.

- question: "What if I get stuck?"
  answer: |
    You have multiple support channels available. Join the [DataTalks.Club Slack community](https://datatalks.club/slack.html) where you can ask questions and get help from instructors and fellow students. We also have an [FAQ repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq) with answers to common questions, a @ZoomcampQABot in Slack for quick help, and regular office hours where you can interact directly with instructors.
