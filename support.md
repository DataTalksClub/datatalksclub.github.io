Hello everyone!

I'm Alexey, and I run the DataTalks.Club community.

I founded it in September 2020, and it has since grown to over 73,000 members.

Our community hosts numerous activities: we offer free courses,
weekly podcasts, webinars, and workshops. Additionally, our Slack workspace is highly active and
requires regular moderation.

All of this demands significant time, energy, and financial resources.

Sponsorship helps me cover operational costs and maintain motivation.
Furthermore, I reinvest the money from our sponsors directly back
into the community to ensure its continued growth.

I commit to the following principles:

* Your privacy is protected. No sponsor will ever receive direct access
  to your email addresses without your explicit consent. 
* I will clearly indicate when content is sponsored.

If you represent a company and would like to support our community,
please reach out to me via email (alexey@datatalks.club).

If you're an individual who wants to support me personally, you can do so through
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/alexeygrigorev){:target="_blank"}.
