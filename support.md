Hi everyone!

I'm Alexey and I'm running the DataTalks.Club community.

I started it in September 2020 and by now it has grown to 12,000 members.
There are a lot of activities in our community: we have courses, there are two events per week,
and we invite book authors to answer questions about their books to the `#book-of-the-week` channel.
Also, our Slack is quite active and sometimes requires moderation.

All this takes a lot of time, energy, and also money.

Sponsorship helps me cover the costs and stay motivated. On top of that, I'd like to invest
the money from sponsors back into the community to ensure its further growth.

I promise the following:

* Your emails are safe. No sponsor will ever get direct access to your email
  addresses without your concent. 
* I will clearly indicate if content is sponsored.

If you're a company and want to support the community, reach out to me via email (alexey@datatalks.club).

If you're an individual and want to support me personally, you can use
[GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/alexeygrigorev){:target="_blank"} for that.
