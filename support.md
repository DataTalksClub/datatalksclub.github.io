Hi everyone!

I'm Alexey and I'm running the DataTalks.Club community.

I started it in September 2020 and by now it has grown to 38,000+ members.

There are a lot of activities in our community: we have courses,
weekly events and workshops. Also, our Slack is quite active and
sometimes requires moderation.

All this takes a lot of time, energy, and money.

Sponsorship helps me cover the costs and stay motivated.
On top of that, I invest the money from our sponsors back
into the community to ensure its further growth.

I promise the following:

* Your emails are safe. No sponsor will ever get direct access
  to your email addresses without your concent. 
* I will clearly indicate if content is sponsored.

If you're a company and want to support the community,
reach out to me via email (alexey@datatalks.club).

If you're an individual and want to support me personally, you can use
[GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/alexeygrigorev){:target="_blank"}
for that.
