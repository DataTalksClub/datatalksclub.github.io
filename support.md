# Support DataTalks.Club

Hello everyone!

I'm Alexey, and I run the DataTalks.Club community.

I founded it in September 2020, and it has since grown to over 79,000 members across our global network of data science professionals.

<section class="community-activities" aria-labelledby="activities-heading">
  <h2 id="activities-heading" class="sr-only">Community Activities</h2>
  <p>Our community hosts numerous activities to help data professionals learn and grow: we offer <a href="/courses.html">free courses</a>, <a href="/podcast.html">weekly podcasts</a>, <a href="/events.html">webinars and workshops</a>, and <a href="/books.html">book discussions with authors</a>. Additionally, our <a href="/slack.html">Slack workspace</a> is highly active with over 79,000 members and requires regular moderation.</p>

  <h2 id="support-heading">Why We Need Your Support</h2>
  <p>Maintaining a community of this size and quality demands significant time, energy, and financial resources. From hosting weekly events to moderating thousands of discussions, every aspect requires dedicated attention and investment.</p>
  
  <p>Your sponsorship helps me cover operational costs, maintain motivation, and continue delivering value to our community. Furthermore, I reinvest every dollar from our sponsors directly back into the community through better tools, more events, and enhanced learning resources to ensure continued growth and impact.</p>

<section class="principles" aria-labelledby="principles-heading">
  <h2 id="principles-heading">Our Commitment to You</h2>
  <p>Transparency and trust are fundamental to our community. I commit to the following principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your privacy is protected. No sponsor will ever receive direct access to your email addresses or personal information without your explicit consent.</li>
    <li>I will clearly indicate when content is sponsored, ensuring you always know when we're working with partners.</li>
    <li>All sponsorship decisions prioritize the value and relevance to our community members.</li>
  </ul>
