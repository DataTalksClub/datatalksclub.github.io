# Production Readiness Status

## Current Status: Partial Production Support ⚠️

The Rust SSG can now handle most production use cases but needs additional work for full parity with Jekyll.

## What Works for Production ✅

### Individual Pages (95%+ of site)
- ✅ Blog posts - Full rendering with formatting
- ✅ Book pages - Complete with descriptions and links
- ✅ Podcast episodes - All metadata and content
- ✅ People/Author pages - Profile pages working
- ✅ Course pages - Listing and details
- ✅ Root pages - Articles, events, tools pages

### Dynamic Features
- ✅ Data files loaded from `_data/` (events.yaml, sponsors.yaml, etc.)
- ✅ Basic loops: `{% for book in site.books %}`
- ✅ Data loops: `{% for sponsor in site.data.sponsors %}`
- ✅ Loop variables: `{{ book.title }}`, `{{ book.id }}`
- ✅ Loop limits: `{% for item in collection limit: 5 %}`
- ✅ Includes and conditionals

## What Needs Work ⚠️

### Critical for Full Production Use

1. **`{% assign %}` with Filters**
   - Current: Assigns are removed but variables not mapped
   - Needed: Parse assigns and map variables
   - Example: `{% assign sorted = site.posts | sort: 'date' | reverse %}`
   - Impact: Index page, listing pages

2. **Liquid Filter Support**
   - `sort: 'field'` - Sort collections by field
   - `reverse` - Reverse order
   - `where_exp` - Filter collections by expression
   - `date_to_string` - Format dates (partially works)
   - Impact: Sorted lists, filtered collections

3. **Advanced Loop Features**
   - Nested loops with proper variable scoping
   - More forloop variables (index, first, last, length)
   - Loop performance optimization

### Nice to Have (Lower Priority)

4. **Advanced Filters**
   - `group_by` - Group items by field
   - `where` - Simple filtering
   - String manipulation filters (downcase, upcase, etc.)

5. **Other Liquid Features**
   - `{% unless %}` conditionals
   - `{% elsif %}` / `{% else %}` in conditionals
   - `{% capture %}` blocks

## Performance

- Current build time: ~3.4 seconds for 762 pages
- With filter support: Expected ~4-5 seconds
- Still 50-100x faster than Jekyll (3-10 minutes)

## Testing Checklist for Production

Before deploying to production, test these pages:

### Critical Pages
- [ ] Index page (/) - Shows latest posts, events, sponsors
- [ ] Blog listing (/blog/) - Shows all posts sorted by date
- [ ] Books page (/books.html) - Shows all books
- [ ] Podcast page (/podcast.html) - Shows episodes sorted
- [ ] Events page (/events.html) - Shows upcoming and past events

### Individual Pages (Should Already Work)
- [x] Individual blog post
- [x] Individual book page
- [x] Individual podcast episode
- [x] Individual person page
- [x] About/static pages

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Hybrid (Recommended for Now)
- Use Rust SSG for fast development and testing
- Use Jekyll for production deployments until filters are implemented
- Benefit from 100x faster local builds

### Option 2: Incremental Production Rollout
- Deploy Rust-generated site for most pages
- Use Jekyll-generated versions for complex listing pages
- Gradually expand Rust coverage as features are added

### Option 3: Complete Implementation
- Implement remaining Liquid filters (1-2 days of work)
- Test thoroughly on all page types
- Full production deployment

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Assign Support (Highest Priority)
**Effort: 4-6 hours**
- Parse `{% assign var = value %}` statements
- Store variables in context
- Reference variables in loops and expressions

### Phase 2: Core Filters (High Priority)
**Effort: 6-8 hours**
- Implement `sort: 'field'` filter
- Implement `reverse` filter
- Implement `where_exp` filter
- Test on real templates

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)
**Effort: 8-12 hours**
- Additional filters (where, group_by, etc.)
- Enhanced loop variables
- Better error messages
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Polish (Low Priority)
**Effort: 4-6 hours**
- Edge case handling
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation updates
- CI/CD integration

## Total Estimated Effort

- **Minimum for production**: 10-14 hours (Phases 1-2)
- **Full feature parity**: 22-32 hours (All phases)

## Conclusion

The Rust SSG is production-ready for **individual content pages** (95% of the site) and provides massive performance benefits. For full production deployment including all listing pages, implementing `{% assign %}` and core Liquid filters is recommended. This is achievable with 1-2 days of focused development work.

The infrastructure is solid - the hard parts (parsing, rendering, collections, data files, loops) are done. What remains is implementing the filter functions themselves, which is straightforward given the existing architecture.
